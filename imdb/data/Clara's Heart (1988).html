<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently saw this movie for the second time. The first time I was 13 years old, and while I really enjoyed it then, it was certainly worth a second viewing as an adult. This movie has so many layers... Whoopi Goldberg is brilliant in her role as a Jamaican housekeeper, and both she and Neil Patrick Harris are quite witty... at times I found myself laughing out loud at their sarcastic banter. Besides making me laugh and cry, this movie also makes me angry... David's parents seem so self-absorbed and unconcerned about their son's welfare. I really felt sorry for him, and glad he had Clara. The ending is refreshing in that it is not a sappy "happily ever after", but also not horrible... it's nice to see something realistic for a change.</p>
