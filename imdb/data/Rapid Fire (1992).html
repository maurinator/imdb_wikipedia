<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this once when I was about 10 years old and ever since that I have been a huge Brandon Lee fan, and since the first time I watched it I have seen this movie over and over again and I never seem to get bored of it. Everything about this film is good, especially the seemingly non-stop action and Brandon Lee's amazing martial arts skills which he displays very well. Another part of this movie is the incredible acting.....both from Brandon Lee and the supporting actor Powers Boothe(Mace Ryans) . This is one of those films that stick out and it's one of those films which you can just watch over and over again and never get bored of. When you see a normal action film you notice that the acting and the plot are rather weak however in Rapid Fire everything is strong and enjoyable....the plot, the acting and of course the action. Many people have said that Rapid Fire is slightly tacky and corny, well all I can say is what do you expect from an action movie made in 1992?This is an amazing film which really sticks out and leaves a mark, and Brandon Lee is excellent and not to mention funny and his sarcasm and strange sense of humor is a fresh change from the usual wooden and hollow action heroes. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you're a Brandon Lee fan such as myself this is truly unmissable. 9 out of 10</p>
