<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Obscure Finnish horror movie about a woman who goes to a sorcerer to get help in her love life. She gets the help, but the side effect is that she turns into a vampire reindeer at night. It is kind of like watching a werewolf film.The movie is both excellent and interesting because I got to see a culture that I hadn't seen on film before. It was a village of reindeer herders in Northern Europe. What other movie can you see with a reindeer race? Anyway, I thought Mirjami Kuosmanen as the woman with the taste for blood. The movie has very few words but a continuous score in the background. It is almost like watching a silent film. I found the cinematography very interesting in this film. Overall, I get it an 8/10 and recommend that you see it if you can find it.</p>
