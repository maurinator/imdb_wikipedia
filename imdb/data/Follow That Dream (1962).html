<h1>Follow That Dream (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the Kwimper family car runs out of gas on a new Florida highway and an officous state supervisor tries to run them off, Pop Kwimper digs in his heels and decides to do a little homesteading. He and his son Toby and their "adopted" children - Holly, Ariadne and the twins - start their own little community along a strip of the roadside. The fishing is good and the living is easy until the mob sets up a gambling operation and the state supervisor sics a sexy social worker on the Kwimpers in an effort to take away Ariadne and the twins.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of Elvis's better comedies. The movie has some good Elvis tunes and overall a nice light feel to it. The final courtroom scene is great and makes you wish every day in court ended up this way. While it is a "formula" movie in many respects, it does make for a nice evening or rainy afternoon "get away from it all" and have a laugh sitting. A must for any Elvis fan!</p>
