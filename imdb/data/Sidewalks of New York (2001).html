<h1>Sidewalks of New York (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Six New Yorkers have an interrelated series of relationships. TV producer Tommy, who's just broken up with his girlfriend, has a short relationship with commitment-phobe Maria, who he meets in a video store, and also hooks up with married real-estate agent Annie, who he meets while apartment hunting. Annie is open to a relationship because her husband, Griffin, is cheating on her, which she slowly comes to realize through talking to her friend/co-worker who's gone through the same thing. Griffin, a 39-year-old dentist, is cheating with 19-year-old waitress Ashley, who he picked up in a park; she realizes she can do better when Ben, a hotel doorman and aspiring musician, tries to pick her up, in a belated attempt to recover from his divorce a year ago from schoolteacher Maria (the same Maria from the video store). Most of these relationships seem driven more by a desperate need to be in a relationship than actual love.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the DVD commentary, Ed Burns says he wanted to make a movie that was "completely different." Who is he kidding? It's so close to Woody Allen that if it were released as a Woody Allen movie people would accept that Woody had made it. The mannerisms (e.g., people stammering and saying "you know" a lot, the jokes, the hand-held camera)... now don't get me wrong, it's done well, and beautifully filmed and acted ($1 million dollar budget, shot in 17 days? Hard to believe). I hope to see more of lovely Rosario Dawson - omigod, those lips! - and Brittany Murphy's star is rising as we speak. Stanley Tucci needs a toupe. He is an OK actor, nothing special, but I don't want to see this man's ugly bald head.</p>
