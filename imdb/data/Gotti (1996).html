<h1>Gotti (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Gotti, the head of a small New York mafia crew breaks a few of the old family rules. He rises to become the head of the Gambino family and the most well-known mafia boss in America. He is known as the Dapper Don for his expensive taste in suits, and the Teflon Don because none of the FBI charges against him will stick. Life is good, but suspicion creeps in, and greed, rule-breaking and his high public profile all threaten to topple him.</p>
<p>Biopic of the infamous New York mobster from his beginnings as the leader of a crew to the heights of leading the Gambino crime family - to his eventual fall and imprisonment. Gotti is a good earner and is very close to Neil Dellacroce, the number two man in the family. When Carlo Gambino dies however, his decision to make Paul Castellano the head of the family doesn't sit well with Gotti and others. They all put up with it for several years but eventually, Gotti gets fed up with Castellano and has him killed, making himself head of the family in the process. Gotti was the subject of several Federal investigations but always managed to be found not guilty, earning the sobriquet The Teflon Don. Determined to get a conviction, the FBI finally manage to get him on tape not only admitting to crimes, but speculating on how he might have to do something about his right-hand man, Sammy "The Bull" Gravano. When presented with the information, Gravano makes a deal with the prosecutors and testifies against his one-time friend who is sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>
<p>John Gotti rises to head the powerful Gambino crime family before being convicted in 1992 of racketeering and murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For a TV movie this is very good. Why Mr. Assante doesn't get more good parts is amazing to me. He nails this part and if you have ever read anything about Gotti you have to believe that the two met. The movie has some great scenes. The best are when the mob guys are just hanging around. The creators of "Sopranos" have used this very well because while wiseguys are not always wise they are sure colorful.</p>
