<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First, I apologies because my English, I'm from Panama. Second, for me, TSL is a very beautiful movie and I know that it is far from the book by Nathaniel Hawthorne, nevertheless, I found nice things there, for instance, the setting was so refreshing to me and the love scenes were very romantic too. In this movie I felt in love to Gary Oldman.  I consider that Demi as well as Gary were chemistry.  On the other hand, I think that the producer and the whole team portrait the epoch of the pilgrims, the way they lived and thought about morality and religion. Demi was pretty in this character and convincing.  For me this was a sad story of love. Although, the screenplay changed at the end, I found that this movie was done to give audience happier than the original book.</p>
