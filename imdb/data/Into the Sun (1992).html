<h1>Into the Sun (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pilot Paul Watkins is stationed in the Mediterranean area to fly patrol and to protect the air space from the expansion tendencies of an Arabian country. But then he's withdrawn from the patrol and gets the order to lead the actor Tom Slade around on their base and explain him everything: The popular star wants to get "the feeling" for his next movie. Paul is less than thrilled with this task, although he's impressed by Slade's talent. During a sample flight they get right into an air combat and into the enemy's land. Now they can show who's more of a fighter...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented this movie only because I like Michael Pare, and the box looked nice, and (though I could've easily found something better) it wasn't bad.Anthony Michael Hall (Just as his career was going going down the drain) and Michael Pare are well cast for their roles and the sets were well done. Hall plays a successful Hollywood megastar sent to an air force base to research his upcoming role. Pare is a pilot assigned to show him around and teach him the ropes. Pare instantly dislikes Hall, but can't back out. The two get caught up in the middle of a battle and are forced to crash land in the desert. They are then taken hostage and the movie keeps going, and going , and going. Though it was short, it felt like it was three hours, and going nowhere.+ (GOOD THINGS)  1.) Casting of Hall and Pare  2.) Aerial shots  3.) The sets(BAD THINGS)  1.) The bad guys  2.) The length  3.) The pacingTOTAL:  5.5/10</p>
