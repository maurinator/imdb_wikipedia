<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For Sturges, the West was a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorsed the point Sturges believed there were three essentials to every Western: 1. Isolation  a man standing alone with no hope of help from outside (e.g. Spencer Tracy's predicament in "Bad Day at Black Rock when the telegraph lines are cut). 2. A man, or group of men compulsively take law and justice, rightly or wrongly, into their own hands (e.g. "The Magnificent Seven"). 3. The issues are resolved by violence in the form of gunplay (e.g. "Gunfight at the OK Corral," "Hour of the Gun"). He followed this up by saying: 'A Western is a controlled, disciplined, formal kind of entertainment. There's good and bad; clearly defined issues; there's chase; there's a gunfight.'"Hour of the Gun" covers the period just after the famous gun battle The film is well done but there are some downfalls: It shows only one face of Wyatt his "official" law abiding side, with no women in his life And also no Johnny Ringothe main bad guy and rival of Doc HollidayThere are solid performances all around, beginning with James Garner who plays a hero with a badge, and is powerful in his intensity Wyatt's vengeance for the murder of his brother show the primal potency of violenceRobards plays John Hollidayan ordinary man dying of tuberculosis who becomes one of Wyatt's most loyal allies with an insatiable greed for drinking, gambling and fighting Robards is quite good in his character, and does deliver a couple of colorful lines to Earp The relationship and chemistry between the two men is unique It's difficult to outline, but it's like these two were old souls who would go through hell with/for each other and never need to wonder or to argue itRyan, as a Westerner, has played straight as well as crooked  his hunted killer in "The Naked Spur" and his ageing lawman (losing his vision at crucial moments) in "The Proud Ones" being equally memorable In more recent roles he has been basically sympathetic  as the horse-handler in "The Professionals," as William Holden's weary, reluctant pursuer in "The Wild Bunch," as the pacifist sheriff in "Lawman"  the exception being "Hour of the Gun," in which once again he was the outlaw on the run, this time with a relentless Wyatt Earp in pursuit Ryan has perhaps achieved more as an actor in other genres, but the Western would have been the poorer without him</p>
