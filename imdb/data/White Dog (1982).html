<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you get the chance, by all means see this movie, but try to leave your preconceptions aside.Before this movie came out, it was roundly denounced by people who misunderstood what it is about.  The story is not, as many feared, about a dog trained to attack black people.  It is the story of a man (Paul Winfield) and his determination to do something that everyone says cannot be done - FREE the dog of its programming.  Unfortunately, it seems that too few people were able to break THEIR programming and give this movie a chance.</p>
