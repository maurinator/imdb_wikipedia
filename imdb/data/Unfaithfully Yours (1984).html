<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dudley made the film so much more funny. By seeing both versions you can why Dudley was a comic genius. I miss him. Dudley makes clear what screwballs we humans are. And he takes ordinary script lines and makes them very funny. Many of the elements of a Shakespearean comedy are in this film, but unlike the plays, this film has a terrific music score, has beautiful photography, and has simple dialogue. What makes this film great, for those mature enough to understand it, is Dudley Moore. Nothing goes as planned and each instance is usually good for a few laughs.Howard Zieff is not exactly what I would call a great director, he was the man behind "The Main Event" and the "My Girl" films, but, he strings things together nicely here. The script is not completely a dud. Barry Levinson had a hand in the remake, so expects some funny bits. One of my favorite scenes is at the restaurant when Moore "thinks" Armand Assante is confronting him about having an affair with his wife, and the start a dueling violin contest of Tchaikovsky. Mr. Moore shows us his gift as a true comedian with shades of slapstick mixed in. Richard Libertini steals the film as Moore's Italian butler and the laughs are countless. The New York City scenery also is a plus with lots of midtown Manhattan brilliantly showcased (made me nostalgic).Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</p>
