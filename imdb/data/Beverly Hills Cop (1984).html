<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film came out, Eddie Murphy's star was still rising and this pretty much was the pinnacle of his career.  This film is a funny, fast paced, action filled fun ride and Murphy really made the film an enjoyable experience.  Thank God that Sylvester Stallone backed out because I feel the film would have been a very dark intense film.  At least Murphy made Axel into a smart aleck who helped to lighten the mood of the film.  Also, the one underrated performance has to have been Judge Reinhold.  Reinhold makes an art of playing slightly goofy out of it characters and his portrayal of Detective Billy Rosewood was a perfect example of that and John Ashton was the perfect foil as Taggart.  This is definitely one of the top films of the 1980's</p>
