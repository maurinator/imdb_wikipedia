<h1>They Only Kill Their Masters (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An enigmatic young woman has been murdered in a small California coast town. The investigation by the local sheriff uncovers a complex web of relationships centering on the victim; the scattered trail of evidence ranges from a mysterious photograph to the victim's own dog. During the investigation, the sheriff meets and becomes romantically involved with a woman whose connection to the murder is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Off the shores of the beach-front town of Eden Landing, California, the dead body of thirty-nine year old divorcée Jenny Campbell is found washed up on the beach, hovered over by her pet Doberman, Murphy. Because of the marks on her body, the initial belief is that Murphy mauled her to death. About one week after the fact, Police Chief Abel Marsh, who had been in Los Angeles at the time of the body being found, takes over the investigation. He has to be resourceful as the detachment is cash strapped. From the autopsy, he finds that she didn't die from being mauled by Murphy - who was actually trying to pull her out of the water - but by drowning in fresh water made to resemble salt water. So the investigation turns to one of murder. The autopsy also uncovers that she was pregnant, which is a seeming dichotomy to the information that Abel receives from her estranged ex-husband that she was a lesbian, the reason for their divorce. He finds from veterinarian Dr. Warren Watkins that Murphy is a well trained animal, who was initially court ordered put down when the belief was that he killed his master. Through the investigation, Abel begins a relationship with veterinary nurse Kate Bingham, a divorcée recently arrived from New York City. Although not a dog person, Abel, with Kate's assistance, ends up taking care of Murphy. Abel believes Murphy and a photo he finds in Jenny's house are the keys to finding Jenny's murderer. An obstacle in Abel finding the killer is Sheriff Daniel Streeter, who wants to take over the investigation and who seems often to work at cross purposes to Abel.</p>
<p>California small town police chief investigates a suspicious death involving the victim's own dog that presumably killed its owner.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when I was ten-years-old with my cousin Johnny. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I remember liking it. It seems that Dobermans were capturing the imaginations of Americans from Los Angeles to New York, and this film reflects that craze. Does anyone remember that crazy movie about a group of Dobermans that were trained to commit crime. It's odd how certain dogs become really popular, then aren't very popular at all. That said, I decided to watch this film again...and you know what, it's a really good movie filled with veteran actors who know how to act. Not fast-paced, but a darn good whodunit that will leave you guessing until it is all revealed. A must for James Garner fans. Quite possibly his best, if you don't include the "Great Escape" or "Support Your Local Gunfighter."</p>
