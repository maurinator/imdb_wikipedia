<h1>A Twist of Sand (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A former British Naval Officer now makes his living by smuggling goods around the Mediterranean. After being forced to dump his cargo after nearly being caught by the authorities in Malta, he is eager to recoup his losses. When a former colleague appears and tells a wild story about smuggling diamonds out of South West Africa, he sees his chance to make a lot of money. Accompanied by the wife of a diamond prospector and a few shady characters he embarks on a quest to retrieve the diamonds. The only problem is that nobody trusts anybody else and the only way to retrieve the diamonds is to navigate the dangerous waters of the skeleton coast, a place where few ships have ever survived. To complicate things further, he has some very good reasons for not going there related to a mission he undertook there during the war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The basic problem with this film was it was simply boring. It did not leave you at all interested in the characters, and there development or to care what was going to happen to them. The second problem was the superfluous nature of the character played by Honor Blackman, apart from falling over a lot, she did not seem to do anything. The third problem was the lack of chemistry between the leads. The fourth problem was the total predictability of the way it ended, there was nothing really to get excited about. The film was not that great, I would not choose to recommend this title to you, reader.</p>
