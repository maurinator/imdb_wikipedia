<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time. Back in the early 80s there were two good movies about the the Ewoks from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Both film have the spirit of the Star Wars film in MY opinion and especialy ROTJ. Both films are sad in a way but they are never boring and both have good special effects and the whole nine. Both film has some great music aswell! Seeing Wilford Brimley in this film is a treat. The begging is quite sad but this feature is never boring and like the other its action packed. Fans of Brimley and Star Wars should see this!</p>
