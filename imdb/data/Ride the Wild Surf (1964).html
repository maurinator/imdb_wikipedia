<h1>Ride the Wild Surf (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of friends go to Hawaii in order to practice surfing, their favorite sport. But this is not all they do there - they also find love...</p>
<p>Many of the best surfers head to Hawaii for the two weeks around Christmas as it is considered the time of the biggest waves on the islands, especially at Waimea Bay. Among those that have descended here this year, which promises to have even bigger waves than usual due to an approaching storm, are Malibu based friends Jody Wallis, Chase Colton and Ralph "Steamer" Lane, who know they will be challenged by the Hawaiian surf, let alone those at Waimea Bay. Before the big surf hits Waimea, they meet up with other surfers at nearby beaches. They find that there is competitive mentality among the surfers, not only on who is the best surfer, but who has the greatest overall bravado. The competition is sometimes friendly and sometimes not so friendly. The biggest competition is to become king of Waimea, which requires not only surfing skill but moxie. Although they didn't come in search of it, they also find romance. Steamer, for who surfing is only a casual past-time while he works his way through life, is attracted to Lily Kilua, an islander. They have to hide the fact of him being a surfer from her protective mother, who believes surfers are nothing but trouble, much like Lily's absent father. Wealthy Chase, who always takes the most traditional path, hooks up with Augusta Poole, a mainlander visiting for Christmas. Their relationship is despite their less than friendly initial meeting. Augie's adventurous mentality is the exact opposite of Chase's, the two who will have to find the right balance. And Jody, the best surfer of the three who considers himself a full time surfer in part because he is running away from everything else in life, hooks up with Augie's friend, the staid Brie Matthews. Brie tries to instill a sense of responsibility into Jody's life path.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good time parties and excellent surfing footage, plus a better than average script (involving most of the usual beach melodrama, except without the jealousy of AIP's beachers).  The leads are all good looking, reasonably mature dialogue and a well-shared spread of characterization making them seem more mature and real than most beach "kids".  Of course, many modern day fans of beach movies are looking only for derisive laughs, so they should probably look elsewhere -- because this is a more heartfelt, less light film.  Could have shown the way for some new stars -- but this hollywood brat club got mostly passed over.</p>
