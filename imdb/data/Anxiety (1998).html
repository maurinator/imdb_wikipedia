<h1>Anxiety (1998)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Manoel de Oliveira brings us a movie which is really a sequence of three stories loosely connected. The feature that binds these stories together is the fact that there is a dark tone in all of them and anxiety for different reasons. Be it the scientist afraid of getting old or the man fearful for the lover's welfare, there is a great portrait of suffering in many forms throughout the movie. In the end, I found several memorable moments all through the movie, but especially in the third story. The first story was also pretty interesting and the dialogues incredibly rich (as in most of Oliveira's movies). You can see the hand of the director in the movements of the camera, in the disposition of the actors and in the haunting mood of the narrative. 9/10</p>
