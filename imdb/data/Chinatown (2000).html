<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>no wonder this got on e!'s top ten dvd's of the year list! i watch a lot of dvd's and this one finally stopped me in my tracks, i sat up, i thought, hmm, that was pretty interesting, what's this section? hey that was cool, i haven't seen that before, and it just got wierder and funnier and better and better. i think this guy had total control over the making of the dvd, it says the menus and cover art is even done by him.  you can tell there were no marketing boys in suits mucking in it. this thing is incredible, the best and most diverse features i've ever seen, even new category names, and i hardly heard of it and it gets on e'insiders top ten dvd's of the year with spiderman, harry potter, etc., you can see this director made the dvd right for the viewer, it's like hanging out with a close friend, and he's funny in his commentary too, but very poignant, the single disc must be a dvd 9 cause you get a ton of material, twice as much for the price of one disc, you can tell he thought about this dvd, pushed it to a new level and made it for us, the dvd fans, not just throwing money at it like the studios and boring us with a bunch of featurettes we're gonna see on tv anyway, each section is like a little treasure, a surprise behind each door just like the film itself, and on that note-what a movie! no wonder it won so many awards, check out the real audience reaction on the dvd from premieres in u.s., london, hong kong, and even in mainland china! those were so cool, and the trips you take around the world with the director in dvd-o-rama are awesome. what a talent. i'm rooting for this guy, he's like the rocky of the dvd world amongst the rest of the giants! go get 'em steve, we're right behind you! and i almost forgot, you get this neat little fortune teller thing in it too, you know the ones you folded up as a kid and asked it questions and kinda open and closed it with two fingers on each hand to find your fortune? it looks great just sittin' on my desk at work and everyone picks it up and goes, "Oh yeah i remember these!" very creative i thought to stick in a dvd! cheers again.
