<h1>Dragnet (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Friday and Streebek are assigned to some very strange robberies, like i.e. the stealing of one bat, a 30 foot long snake and the mane of a lion from a zoo. All the latest BAIT magazines were also recently stolen, and some chemicals that when are mixed correctly develops a very deadly gas. All these thefts have one thing in common; visit cards with the word "PAGAN" left at the crime scenes. Solving these crimes, including why plenty of police vehicles have been stolen lately, involves the usual; to drink coffee at strip tease bars, rescue kidnapped virgins from drowning and lose their jobs.</p>
<p>The equally-straight-laced and "by the book" nephew of Joe Friday must work with his more laid-back partner to solve a mystery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of the TV series, both the '50's and '60's versions, but I couldn't help watching this one on TNT. The impersonation of Joe Friday is so hilarious it hurts, and his Partner Pep Streebeck was excellent. Harry Morgan from the '60's version was in this, promoted to captain. Next time the film came on, I taped it, and laughed again. Even though it's making fun of the old series, it's fun to watch, and the acting is great. Top-notch comedy.</p>
