<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fernando Fernan Gomez filmed in comedy tone, the problems that a family of middle class of the 50s has to survive after having a child. For example, shown moonlighting, "Antonio" (F. Fernan Gomez) works as a clerk in the morning and in the afternoon various trades. F. Fernan Gomez made this film a sequel to "La Vida Por Delante". With Analia Gade again."Antonio" (who is a lawyer), offered to defend habitual criminals parading from that moment the thieves various screen with their behavior lead to hilarious situations. One of them deserves to be mentioned is that in which they discuss how to dock a house so that the penalty imposed on them resulting minimum. Also noteworthy are the soliloquies of the characters, which are face to face with the audience to tell her confidences.It is full of fine critical spirit and observational comedy of manners, its cleverly subversive tone, lively rhythm and excellent dialogue, as well as a construction "Sui Generis" for the Spanish cinema of the time. "La Vida Alrededor" is today a jewel of Spanish cinema, a classic that graces our filmography (in a sweet moment with Berlanga, Bardem and company) and represents one of the great works of the author, plus a magnificent film.It has an excellent script, in the hands of wonderful actors, shows very funny situations, portraying both the miseries and joys of 50s Spain.</p>
