<h1>Fatal Attraction (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Happily married New York lawyer Dan Callagher has an affair with his colleague Alex, and the two enjoy a love weekend while Dan's wife and kid are away. But Alex will not let go of him, and she will stop at nothing to have him for herself. Just how far will she go to get what she wants?</p>
<p>Dan Gallagher is a successful New York lawyer with a beautiful wife, Beth, and a 6 year-old daughter who spends a weekend with a book editor, Alex Forrest. As far as Dan is concerned, it's a one time thing but Alex has something more in mind, as she amply demonstrates even before the weekend is over. When he makes it clear that there is no future for them, Alex begins to seek him out, whether calling him constantly calling him at home or at work and even visiting his apartment, which is up for sale, and meeting Beth. Alex's obsession knows no bounds and she becomes increasingly violent, putting Dan's life - and that of his family's - in danger.</p>
<p>Dan Gallagher, a New York City corporate lawyer, and Beth Gallagher are happily married, with a six year old daughter named Ellen. When Beth and Ellen leave town for what ends up being an extended weekend, Dan, regardless, falls into a sexual liaison with Alex Forrest, a woman he has just met. She is a new associate editor at one of Dan's firm's client agencies. As Alex knows about Dan's marital situation, Dan enters into the liaison with the unspoken understanding that it is no-strings and will end no later than when Beth and Ellen return home at the end of the weekend. He feels comfortable enough with the situation when he and Alex entered into it mutually initiated as he has no reason to see Alex in his day to day life. As the end of the weekend approaches, it becomes increasingly clear to Dan that Alex wants to continue their relationship, she using different means to achieve her goal, including being passive-aggressive toward him, and emotional blackmail. Conversely Dan wants to protect the current life he has with Beth and Ellen, which means Beth not finding out about Alex. As Dan does whatever he can to dissuade Alex, Alex also goes to new extremes to keep Dan, her actions which may possibly include harm to herself, to Dan and most importantly to Beth and Ellen, all in an effort to show him that she will "not be ignored".</p>
<p>A married man's one-night stand comes back to haunt him when that lover begins to stalk him and his family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An attorney for a publishing company finds out the hard way that a harmless fling with a woman can be the beginning of a nightmare, especially if the lady decides that she likes the man, married or not, and refuses to let him end their affair. This glossy thriller plumbs the psyche of a neurotic woman who has issues and demons in her past that drive her to get even with and destroy a stranger with whom she just met after a wild weekend's sexual binge while his wife and daughter were out of town. Glenn Close is chilling as the predatory female who stalks her erstwhile lover, harassing him at every turn, destroying his property and engaging in emotional blackmail of the basest kind. Michael Douglas, as the spurned woman's target and victim, is desperate to keep his indiscretion hidden from his attractive wife, the classy Anne Archer. The cinematography is rich with excellent color and texture, especially the twilight scenes, and the music is spare with subtle shadings. The entire cast is top-notch, especially Close who eyes Douglas the way a python looks at a mouse.</p>
