<h1>Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Although Roxy left town more than fifteen years ago, her memory has never faded. Her expected return starts to impact a number of lives, including that of her former partner Denton Webb. But it is Dinky, the adopted daughter of the Bossettis and ignored by most of her classmates as a strange loner, who may be most changed. She is convinced she is Roxie's secret child.</p>
<p>A small town prepares for the homecoming of superstar Roxy Carmichael, as does a young outsider, who believes Roxy is her mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Adorable Winona Ryder may have become the '90s equivalent of Molly Ringwald had it not been for a succession of poor movie choices that failed to expand on her range (or her appealing post-beatnik persona). As Dinky Bosetti, small town outcast who would like to believe that hometown celebrity Roxy Carmichael is really her long-lost biological mother, Ryder's allure here is reduced to that of a messy, misfit tomboy dressed in black. The script alternately pities and martyrs her, while the sitcom shenanigans happening on the sidelines are never very funny (particularly a lesbian-issue sub-plot which is half-baked and left unresolved). Adopted Dinky loves animals and is picked on at school, though that isn't much to build a character on, and Ryder ends up making faces and acting in a vacuum. The pacing is self-consciously erratic, the editing is sloppy and too much of the dialogue is knowingly facetious. There are a few funny moments and excellent soundtrack choices, although all the picture really needed was a sharper screenplay and a more focused direction. *1/2 from ****</p>
