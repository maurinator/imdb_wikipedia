<h1>Hit Man (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A lawyer whose brother was murdered winds up getting involved with gangsters and the world of porno movies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good black gangster film, American version of the earlier British released "GET CARTER" with Micheal Caine.Follows the same storyline, with main character the gangster Tyrone Tackett, moving back to LA to find out who killed his brother. He moves into the dark underworld of the mob and adult movie bizz, and gets his revenge.  Not bad acting, funky black street talk.   Bloody and violent with harsh language, cheesy action scenes with funky music in the background! 6/10 points</p>
