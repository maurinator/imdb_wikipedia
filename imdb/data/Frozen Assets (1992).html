<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Personally, I enjoyed this movie and will seek to replace my recorded-off-TV tape with the DVD.Zach Shepard (Corbin Bernsen) gets a promotion but on arrival in Hobart, Oregon, is dismayed to discover that it is not quite the promotion he had in mind. Being like a fish out of water in the sperm bank, his future going down the gurgler, he is determined to make something of it so to get promoted out of there, encountering the opposition of Dr Grace Murdoch (Shelley Long) who is the biogenetic counselor in charge of the sperm bank. I felt they played their parts well with their initial conflicts and tensions softening later. Larry Miller was the 'certifiable nerd', Newton Patterson, who wasn't what people took him to be. Teri Copley was charming as Peaches, one of the local working girls. Things that I liked in this movie were how Newton was accepted by Zach and Grace and given a chance while others rejected him as a looser and dropout and the working girls were also accepted as people, though rejected by some judgmental locals as 'whores'. There is warmth and humor in this movie.</p>
