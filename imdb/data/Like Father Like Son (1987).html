<h1>Like Father Like Son (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Jack Hammond has best chances to become medical superintendent in the clinic. So he's completely absorbed in his work and has no understanding for his teenage son Chris' problems with school. By accident one of them drinks a brain-exchanging serum, and it switches their identities. This leads of course to extraordinary complications in school and at work, but also to insight in the problems and feelings of each other.</p>
<p>A mysterious potion switches the personalities of a buttoned up doctor and his laid back son.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with Roger Ebert on a lot of this movie. First, I agree that Dudly Moore has one good scene and Kirk Cameron has none. Second, I agree that the acting of the movie characters is way off.This is another of the body swap comedies that came out in 1987-1988. This is the worst one of them. Dudly Moore and Kirk Cameron swap bodies when Kirk's friend Sean Austin sneaks some "mind transfer" serum into Dudley's drink. Then the two of them swap minds. At first of course, they're shocked and upset. After that, the way each one of them acts in each other's body is so way off and unconvincing. And they act very annoying on top of that. And neither of them act even remotely funny and amusing except for Dudly twice at the hospital. Once when he sees a machine next to a patients bed, and once when he smokes a cigarette at the board meeting. Every, and I mean everything else from both of them was stupid. Examples include Kirk in Dudley's reaction to Dudly in Kirk driving to school. Kirk in Dudley dancing and yelling to loud music. Dudly in Kirk arrogantly patronizing his classrooms until everyone completely turned againced him. Dudly in Kirk on a date at a rock concert. Kirk in Dudley painting the town red with Sean. And Dudley's forced irritating yelling such as his singing "Jeremiah was a bullfrog" and his yelling "I wanna be a doctor! I wanna be a doctor!".Then for the supporting characters: the high school kids (the bully, the hot girl, the other cliques that wouldn't except Kirk) were just tired retreads of other 80s high school movies. The seducing woman from the hospital was so snobby. The chief executive boss at the hospital was a one dimensional jerk. Look at all of these different things here made this film something yet to be desired.</p>
