<h1>Amy's Orgasm (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Amy is Jewish, nearing 30, single, and the successful author of "Why Love Doesn't Work," a self-help book for women who aren't in love. She's also a self-described sexorexic - she hasn't had sex with a man in four years and has never had a "mental orgasm." She gets plenty of advice - from her publicist, from her best friends (a married couple), from her parents, and from a priest to whom she goes to confession - so there's lots of conflicting emotion and analysis when she starts dating Matthew Starr, a good-looking playboy who's a popular L.A. male-chauvinist-pig radio shock jock. Each of Amy's theories and rules is put to the test - people may not change, but can love work?</p>
<p>Story of a 29-year-old Ivy League-educated, self-help author as she grudgingly falls for a shock-jock radio host with a reputation for hitting on his bimbo guests.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For me, what "Amelie" was to Paris, "Amy" is to Los Angeles. Amy"s O is a witty, well conceived and acted presentation and resolution (the cop-out ending!) of a feminist argument, alive with larger than life characters, each contributing a perspective on the argument, which is of course, maintaining female self esteem in a traditional relationship.  The best of this genre - funny and intellectually satisfying - 9/10</p>
