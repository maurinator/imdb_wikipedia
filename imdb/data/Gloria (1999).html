<h1>Gloria (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sharon Stone plays a street-wise, middle-aged moll standing up against the mobs, all of which is complicated by a 6 year old urchin with a will of his own who she reluctantly takes under her wing after his family has been gunned down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has no business connecting itself with the great movie made in 1980 called "Gloria" and starring Gena Rowlands and directed by her husband John Cassevettes.  That movie's opening credits sequence is better than the entire thing here - the paintings and the beautiful music set the mood for the movie.</p>
