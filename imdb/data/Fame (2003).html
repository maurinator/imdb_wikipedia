<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For making the band! You started out quiet and reserved, but in the end, your talent and beauty prevailed. Hope this new endeavor will take you far. You and your band mates appear to have great chemistry. Your performance of "Touching My Body" was awesome. Looking forward to the release of that single and that of your first CD. Hopefully, we will be seeing more of you and the rest soon. Perhaps one day your friendship with the others will resemble that of Aubrey's and Aundrea's. Their friendship on air was so endearing, as well as inspirational and admirable. With that type of chemistry, I really don't see anything stopping you guys from reaching the top. Best wishes and once again, congratulations!</p>
