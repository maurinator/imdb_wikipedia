<h1>Tomahawk (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1866, a new gold discovery and an inconclusive conference force the U.S. Army to build a road and fort in territory ceded by previous treaty to the Sioux...to the disgust of frontier scout Jim Bridger, whose Cheyenne wife led him to see the conflict from both sides. The powder-keg situation needs only a spark to bring war, and violent bigots like Lieut. Rob Dancy are all too likely to provide this. Meanwhile, Bridger's chance of preventing catastrophe is dimmed by equally wrenching personal conflicts. Unusually accurate historically.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just found a video of Tomahawk at a yard sale. The filming itself was beautiful in glorious Technicolor! If you are a Western fan you will like this one, so give it a watch if you have the opportunity. Van Heflin played Jim Bridger the famous mountain man and scout. Mr. Heflin was a wonderful actor, but I think I would have chosen someone else to play the legendary Bridger. He just didn't seem rough and tough enough for the part. Maybe he did such a good job in Shane that I type cast him myself. Still, he did a very good acting job in this one. Good old Jack Oakie was the side kick and added the light touch of humor. His acting experience was always welcome in any movie. Another great character actor, Tom Tully, ran a traveling medicine type wagon show with Yvonne De Carlo as his assistant. I don't remember seeing her lovelier. Preston Foster as the always reliable man in charge as the commander of the fort. Alex Nicol played his part well as the bad guy (who kills Indians from hate). An early bit part for Rock Hudson as Hanna. By the look on his sleeve he was a corporal. Watch fast or you will miss him. Ann Doran was Preston Foster's wife Mrs. Col. Carrington, always a reliable actress (remember her as James Dean's mother in Rebel Without A Cause?) The very lovely Susan Cabot played an Indian girl who travels with Jim Bridger since her family was killed by the Chivington gang (Susan was murdered in 1986 by her son who suffered from dwarfism). Red Cloud was played very ably by John War Eagle. He was a veteran of many movies and TV work, mostly westerns such as Winchester 73, Annie Get Your Gun with Betty Hutton, Sgt. Preston, Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill Jr, Roy Rogers show, etc. Capt. Fetterman was played by Arthur Space a long time character actor along with Russell Conway as Major Horton another great character actor. It is just a good old fashioned Western with plenty of action. Don't worry about historical facts or get caught up in the old treatment of Native Americans debate. We are all aware that the Indians got a raw deal in many a treaty and that white, black and red people were murdered without reason. The movie is meant to entertain. Let it do its job and just enjoy the movie for what it is. Well worth watching!</p>
