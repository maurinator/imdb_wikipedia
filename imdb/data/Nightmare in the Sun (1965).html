<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An odd kind of film, but entertaining, a few brutal scenes to it but relatively a tame movie by today's standards. This film was not some all time great by any means, but it did hold my interest. - Oh, but to start with, contrary to the summery of this film, the hitchhiker and the woman never actually have a sexual affair.. it was really no more than a brief chance encounter.Here is a more accurate overview of the movie.. An older man with a young sexy wife, who, in a fit of misguided jealousy, comes home and kills her with a shotgun - one blast to her, then about 4 shots to her teddy bear.. weird. The crooked cop enters the scene and bullies the killer husband into a deal.. they are going to pin the wrap on the hitchhiker who is passing through town. So now the hitchhiker is on the run for a crime he did not commit. - Sounds familiar don't it?..It's interesting that Sammy Davis Jr. had a short part as a truck driver in this film. Robert Duval plays a more substantial role as one of a pair of trouble makers on a motorcycles (and there are definite undertones that he and his sidekick are.. well.. sweet) Anyway.. everyone is trying to capture the hitchhiker and rake in a reward.. So what happens next?.. hey, I ain't going to tell you the whole damn story!</p>
