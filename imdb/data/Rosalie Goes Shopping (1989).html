<h1>Rosalie Goes Shopping (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rosalie loves to shop too much to let a little thing like no money stop her. When the local shopkeepers no longer take her bad checks or bad credit cards, she's reduced to stealing from one family member to buy presents for others. It's looking pretty bleak until her daughter pushes her into buying a 'guilt gift' of a PC, complete with modem. Master shopper becomes master hacker, and Rosalie is back on top.</p>
<p>A kindly but thieving shopaholic tries to turn her mistakes around, but does so by becoming a skilled computer hacker, something that could only get her into more trouble despite her goal to impress her beloved family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was delightfully quirky for the first half hour or so, reminiscent  of John Waters, without the grossness or the sex.  But it got dull thereafter--never as funny as it should have been--and dwindled to an ending that was so non-climactic, they had to intersperse it between the credits so you'd know it was over.  Too bad, because the first part showed a lot of promise.  Still, worth seeing if you're in the mood.</p>
