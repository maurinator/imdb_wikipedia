<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when it first came out and totally loved it..Especially Phyllis Dillers character. I saw it several times and then I mentioned it to my sister (7 yrs older) and she told me it had not been on in years. FINALLY about 5 years ago I found it. I bought 2 copies 1 for me to watch and one for my future grandchildren. I love it and watch it every year since I got it. It's great fun and I still enjoy it immensely and I am 45 years old. I guess I am a big kid at heart every year I watch all the specials, Charlie brown, Rudolph, year without a Santa Claus etc. They make me remember when times were easy and holidays were more about being together and having fun.</p>
