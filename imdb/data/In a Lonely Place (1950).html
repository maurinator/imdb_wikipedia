<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bogart stretches his acting muscles and allows his vulnerability to be on display in this realistic gut-wrenching love story.  Gloria Grahame, one of the underrated great US actresses of the 40's and 50's, has an electrifying chemistry with Bogie, touching a side that we'd never seen -- not even with Lauren Bacall, laced with an odd kind of violent tenderness.  Frank Lovejoy heads a fantastic supporting cast, heavy on three-dimensional characterisations.  This unknown classic is Bogie's most complete performance ever.  I give it 10 out of 10.</p>
