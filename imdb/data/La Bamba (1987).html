<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The life and times of Richie Valens, and  well made to say the least. Lou Diamond  Phillips really showed a lot of promise in this  film, but poor choices later in his career hurt  his rep in Hollywood. Nonetheless, this film  is quite an achievement in regards to portraying  a rock idol (which was far better than the dull  Buddy Holly Story). What really made this film  was the relationship between Phillips and Esai  Morales. Never has a brotherly dynamic been  portrayed so fluidly, displaying the sweet and  sour sides of the two growing up. With the help  of a great soundtrack, I really felt this film has  a spirit which isn't displayed in biographies  anymore. Nowadays, most films try too hard  to show the downside, which is what this tried  not to do. 7.5/10</p>
