<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I worked with MCA Australia as the Assistant Film Promotions Manager on The Adventures of Barry McKenzie.  MCA was the film distributer throughout the major cities in Australia of this film.  At that time, it was rated the most popular Australian film in their history.  I worked directly with Barry Humphries who not only starred in the movie as four different characters, but was instrumental in introducing Foster's Lager, the Bazza McKenzie Hat and the Aunt Edna character (who manifested herself into Dame Edna, who is widely recognized world-wide).  Not to forget Bruce Beresford and Barry McKenzie!  I still have a copy of the comic strip "Bazza Pulls it Off" and "The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie" (which the movie script was derived from). Sadly, I lost the Barry McKenzie Soundtrack.I'll never forget the Grand Opening Premiere at The Ascot Theatre in Sydney with all the cast, producers, directors, etc.  The after party was held at The St. George's Club where Foster's Lager was consumed in abundance.If anyone knows how to obtain a copy of this film in a video format, I'd love to purchase it.  It would bring back so many of my memories of the wonderful experiences I had during the four and half years I lived in Australia.Please feel free to e-mail me at  if you have any idea how to access a copy of the movie.Deborah Faurot, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</p>
