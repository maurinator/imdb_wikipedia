<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this sequel to the original movie was a bit better,i thought.the story was more interesting,and there were more funny moments.there is less action than the first one,but that didn't make much difference to me.the same characters are back.(Nash Crawford)Walter Brennan,(Jason Fitch)Edgar Buchanan,Amos Polk(Andy Devine) and Gentleman George Agnew(Chill Wills)are all in good form here,but it is the addition of Fred Astaire which makes the movie.Astaire steals the show,in my opinion.like the first movie,this one is a lot of fun,and suitable for most family members,probably anyone 10 or older.for me,The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again is a 6.3/10</p>
