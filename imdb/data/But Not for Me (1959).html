<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Charmer finds Gable at near the end of his career still fully in command of his star power as a somewhat roguish producer who is juggling both personal and professional issues. Lilli Palmer is an excellent match for him, her continental charm playing off his brusk exasperation with surprising ease. She's so good it's a shame her role is rather small but she makes every moment she's on screen memorable and you miss her when she's out of the picture.Lee J. Cobb likewise makes his modest role seem more than it is by filling it with his magnetic presence.Carroll is sexy in a refined way, this was before she cast her lot in the sex symbol derby with junk like Harlow and The Carpetbaggers and wrecked her reputation as a serious actress for several years until she came back as a respected character actress.The kind of breezy star vehicle that is rarely if ever made today, spotlighting the star but loaded with talent in almost every role. Competently directed and as an added bonus Ella Fitzgerald sings the title tune over the credits. For Gable fans this is a must!</p>
