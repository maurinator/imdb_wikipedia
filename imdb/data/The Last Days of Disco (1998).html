<h1>The Last Days of Disco (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Last Days of Disco loosely depicts the "last days" at a disco palace, where drugs, sex and weirdness ran rampant. The story centers around a group of friends who frequent the disco and each other. All the characters are searching for something to make their lives more fulfilling. Some are searching for everlasting love and some are just wanting something different. As the disco is closed, they all wonder can disco ever really be dead?</p>
<p>It's the early 1980s Manhattan. Disco is king, and the clubs playing disco music the palaces where the beautiful people go to see and be seen. As such, Des McGrath wields the most power among his social circle as a low level manager at one of the hottest clubs, he who has some influence on who is on the "do not admit" and "allow for immediate entry" lists. He is a bit of a cad who has come across a new scam to tell his female conquests who he no longer wants to date that he has just discovered that he is gay. The one person he can't help get into the club is his best friend, ad man Jimmy Steinway, his type who Des' boss Bernie does not want in the club just so that he can impress potential clients. Alice Kinnon and Charlotte Pingress have led parallel lives for the past few years, both being Hampshire College graduates, and both now working as poorly paid readers at a publishing house. Charlotte is conceited and opinionated, and looks down at their colleague Dan Powers, primarily because he attended Harvard. Demure and inexperienced Alice looks to Charlotte for advice, Charlotte who believes that Alice negatively comes across to men at the clubs like a kindergarten teacher. Despite not having any money of their own, both surviving off of allowances from their parents, and not really knowing if they truly are friends, Alice and Charlotte decide to find an apartment together with a mutual friend named Holly. Charlotte knows that Alice likes Jimmy, but convinces her instead to pursue her number two choice, environmental lawyer Tom Platt, who will end up having a profound effect on Alice's being. In turn, another lawyer named Josh Neff enters their lives against Charlotte's wants, he who doesn't want to play the sexual games prevalent in the disco culture. Those within this collective who most closely associate themselves to the disco culture may have a rude awakening in less than a year as disco goes the way of the dinosaur and with it the way they lived and connected to each other as human beings.</p>
<p>Story of two female Manhattan book editors fresh out of college, both finding love and themselves while frequenting the local disco.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the early 80's a group of friends interact around a Manhattan disco, desperate to climb the local social ladder.  With an investigation in the disco's financial dealings and the end of disco approaching the friends attempt to carry on as normal.Director Whit Stillman tends to go for comedies that look inward and have strong comedic dialogue that follow social observations and comment on different cultures and periods.  However plot is never one of his major concerns and here is no different.  The story here is less important that the period of disco which is the real focus.  This may be a bit frustrating to some as the story doesn't seeming to have any one direction.  However the characters and the dialogue will generally hold the interest sufficiently.  Some of the script is a bit weak and the characters occasionally are a bit too unsympathetic but for the majority the sharp script compliments the characters.The performances are good throughout - these socialites are not people I'd ever like to meet but they are funny from a distance.  There is much to like here if you like this type of humour.  But the story is almost non-existent and this is a slight problem.Overall a clever, funny look at the life of a couple of party girls around the time disco started to suck. Not to everyone's taste and what's that credit sequence ending about? - is it a bit of fun or is it trying to say something?</p>
