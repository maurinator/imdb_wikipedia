<h1>Love with the Proper Stranger (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Angie Rossini is an innocent (Italian Catholic) Macy's salesgirl, who discovers she's pregnant from a fling with Rocky, a musician. Angie finds Rocky (who doesn't remember her at first) to tell him she's pregnant and needs a doctor for an abortion. He finds her a doctor and they work together to raise the money. Can these two strangers find love with one another before it's too late?</p>
<p>Italian-American Macy's shop-girl Angie Rossini still lives at home - a small apartment - with her widowed mother and her three protective brothers. She considers her life like living in a fishbowl, where her brothers control everything: what she does, who she sees and to who she should get married. That intended husband is Anthony Columbo, a shy, clumsy man, with who she doesn't hear the "bells and banjos" she envisions with romantic love. As an act of defiance, Angie has a one-night stand - her first and only sexual encounter - with womanizing jazz trumpeter Rocky Papasano, a man she doesn't even know. Rocky escaped a life much like Angie's. His Italian-American parents still live in the Bowery where he grew up and where he doesn't visit often as it reminds him of the repressive lifestyle of unhappy married people as witnessed by his old neighborhood friends. Angie manages to track down Rocky to tell him that she is pregnant with his child. Despite barely remembering Angie, Rocky decides to help Angie with the one and only thing she requests: the name of a doctor to abort the pregnancy. As Angie and Rocky spend the day together leading up to the scheduled abortion, they begin to get to know each other in all its good and bad. This day begins the process of both really figuring out what they want in life.</p>
<p>When Angie Rossini finds out she's pregnant, she tracks down Rocky Papasano the musician with whom she had a one night stand. Angie works a sales clerk in a department store and comes from a close knit Italian family where her brothers keep a close eye on her. The two really don't know one another but Rocky agrees to arrange for her to have an abortion but when he sees the conditions under which it will be performed, he gets her out of there. Faced with his situation, Rocky asks Angie to marry him but she seems uninterested, especially since he sounds like he's taking a dose of bad medicine, and turns to a lovelorn suitor, Anthony, as a solution to her situation. Rocky continues to try and see her however and it soon becomes apparent that she also has another plan.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lovely chemistry between superstars Wood and McQueen make this Robert Mulligan a pure charmer. McQueen sheds his tough guy image to play both romance and even a little comedy as well. Oscar nominee Wood matured beautifully into the role of Angie, the girl who finds she's going to have a baby and it's McQueen's! There is a fine performance from Tom Bosley, in his first major role as a clumsy fellow who tries to win Wood's heart. The conclusion to this film is lovely and full of hope for all young lovers out there. A Must see!!!</p>
