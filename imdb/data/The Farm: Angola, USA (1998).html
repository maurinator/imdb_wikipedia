<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Documentary depicting day to day life in Angola Prison mostly from an inmate's perspective. Interviews are with several inmates including one with a life sentence who is about to die.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Have your kids or students watch this. It's interesting and will provide lots of fodder for discussion about choices in life and their consequences, family, faith, and hope. As others have mentioned, the parole board hearing is of particular interest. You might find yourself shaking your head, as I did. By the way, there is no bad language--as compared to "Scared Straight" for example, so you needn't concern yourself with pre-screening. Outstanding job by filmmakers who stay in the background and let the characters be the story. If you're not familiar with Scared Straight and its sequel, be sure to check it out as well. Note: This is the prison depicted in Oliver Stone's "JFK," where Jim Garrison interviews hustler Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon).</p>
