<h2> Summaries </h2>

Balkan explains that the book was written by the writer Aristide Torchia, in 1666, with Lucifer and he was burned at the stake with his entire work. There are only three exemplars of The Nine Gates and in accordance with the legend, its nine engravings form a riddle to conjure the devil.

Meanwhile, he asks Bernie to hide the rare book. Before traveling to Europe, the widow Liana Telfer wants to retrieve the book and has sex with Corso, but he does not accept her offer. When Corso returns to Bernie's bookstore, he finds his friend murdered in the same position of an engraving.

During his journey in Europe, Corso is pursued by Liana and her bodyguard, who belong to the sect The Order of the Silver Serpents, and is protected by a mysterious Girl with supernatural powers.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Ninth Gate is an expertly paced thriller that relies more on intrigue and subtlety than it does on gross out scenes.  Johnny Depp plays a "book detective" who must authenticate a Satanic text that is reputed to conjure the devil.  Early scenes feature a battle of sarcastic insults between Depp and Frank Langella's character, a multimillionare who hires Depp to authenticate the book.  As Depp traverses Europe to acquire information, he is assisted by Emanuelle Seigner, who is coy when Depp interrogates her on her role in Depp's quest. Seigner's help is needed, as other forces jostle for possession of the book.  The ending is not particularly explosive as a film involving the Devil would suggest, but there is enough intrigue and plot twisting to make The Ninth Gate an enjoyable film.</p>
