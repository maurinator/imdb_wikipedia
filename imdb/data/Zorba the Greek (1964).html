<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first saw Zorba the Greek 4 years ago, I inwardly thanked my philosophy teacher for having us watch this masterpiece.  Today, I am still greatful to him.  This movie is definetely one of my all time favorite. The whole cast is great, the story is really close from the book (except for some details that an author can write in a book, but a director can't put easily in a film), images are wonderful, Crete is.perfect.  If you have never seen this movie, I recommend it to you.</p>
