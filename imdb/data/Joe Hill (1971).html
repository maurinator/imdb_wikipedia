<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brilliant story about swedish-american agitator Joe Hill. Haven't seen this for a few years now, but I still remember Thommy Berggrens acting and the superb script of this Widerberg Classic! Widerberg has a certain way of making us interested in the stories. His storytelling is a little cold and has a documentary feel over them. He has shown that in movie after movie. This is one of the better ones! I'll finish off with Joe Hill's last words..."don't mourn - organize!"9/10</p>
