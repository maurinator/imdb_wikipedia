<h1>At the Earth's Core (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Victorian scientist and his young American backer set off in their new earth-boring machine with a short test on a Welsh mountain. Unfortunately the thing is rather more powerful than expected and they end up in an enormous cavern at the centre of the earth. Here they find a race of humans enslaved to evil oversized prehistoric birds with extra-sensory abilities. The travellers decide they can be some help, the more so as at least one of the slaves is very eye-catching.</p>
<p>A Victorian era scientist and his assistant take a test run in their Iron Mole drilling machine and end up in a strange underground labyrinth ruled by a species of giant telepathic bird and full of prehistoric monsters and cavemen.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Make no mistake, this is a very silly movie.  Peter Cushing knew it; he gives one of his most over-the-top, ham it up performances.Generally speaking, this movie has awful production values.  Flying rubber pterodactyl creatures ruling the underworld.  Piggish humanoid servants of said pterodactyls.  A vapid, vacant-eyed Caroline Munro.  An oh-so-macho leading man who, when you really look at him, doesn't look all that tough.Still, At the Earth's Core has a charming innocence about it that gives it a bit of appeal.  Best viewed by 10 year old boys on rainy Saturday afternoons, it's all in good fun.</p>
