<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The ghost of Zero - "patient zero", who allegedly first brought aids to Canada - materialises and tries to contact old friends.

<p>Sir Richard Burton (no relation to the British actor of the same name) is a Victorian explorer who managed to find and drink from the Fountain of Youth, resulting in him living an unusually long life without aging. Now he is living in Toronto, Canada, where he works as a taxidermist in a museum dedicated to a study of famous diseases. His latest exhibit is the "Hall of Contagion" but it seems ruined when he is unable to acquire the plague rats he considers essential. However, Richard's hopes are raised when he learns about "Patient Zero", the French Canadian flight attendant who was allegedly responsible for bringing AIDS to North America. Richard becomes fascinated with Patient Zero, envisioning him as a serial killer who deliberately infected large numbers of gay men with AIDS. Meanwhile, the ghost of Patient Zero inexplicably returns to Earth. Far from Richard's idea of him as a serial killer, Patient Zero is a confused young man unsure of what is happening. He returns home and visits old relatives, but the only person who can see him is Richard Burton. These two men become partners and eventually fall in love as, together, they learn the truth about AIDS and how its image in the media has been distorted to promote hateful ideologies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen nearly all of John Greyson's films and shorts and enjoyed every single one of them; this was a film I was interested in seeing again and purchased the DVD once it became available, so I'm likely not the most unbiased reviewer. However, this enjoyment is based on the movies themselves, their audacious vision and the innate originality of the filmmaker, not from any personal connection to him or to anyone else who appeared in or worked on any of the films.Patient Zero is perhaps the original of his films because of the treatment of the subject matter. Unfortunately, this is also perhaps the films biggest failing: where the film appears most dated and reflects inaccurate information deals with both HIV and AIDS. However, despite this, the film merits viewing and is highly recommended because some of the subject matter (fear, mistrust, scientific and historical abuse versus education, etc.) are rendered intelligently and well, and in a highly unique and entertaining manner.Well worth renting and well worth repeated viewings.</p>
