<h1>The Debt Collector (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mean, gritty, dirty and low and that's just the Policeman Gary Keltie (Ken Stott) out for retribution for the horrendous crimes against the helpless people of Edinburgh during the nineteen seventies, by notorious, torturous, and killer, debt collector Nickie Dryden (Billy Connolly). This is as hard as they come; giants of their professions one with a trade that needs to be kept secret and the other holding a grudge. Shot around the beautiful City of Edinburgh years later, with it coarse language and criminal underclass, we see the wrath of spite, hate, jealousy and violent vengeance all in the final showdown of justice and with it its uncompromising final debt to society.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a clever movie. Investigators try to get into the mind of a criminal and become them. That takes obsession, but what happens when obsession takes you? It's a fact of life that most people would like to be the tough, bad guy and this seems to be where this movie gets it's ideas. A life time on stage has prepared Connolly well. His performance is admirable. Admittedly, it's been about 3 years since I seen this film as I write this, though I remember strong feelings associated with it. There's something very real about it. I don't want to spoil this for anyone thinking of watching it, so I'll just say the "assualt" scene is particularly real and horrifically scary, as is the fight scene. No stupid Hollywood sound effects added to this one, and that's what makes it so damn scary because it doesn't seem as though it's just an act. If you like Connolly, check it out. If you like a thriller, same deal. If you like movies at all, there's no reason not to have a peek.</p>
