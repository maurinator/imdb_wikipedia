<h1>The Suitor (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pierre is a shy man whose sole focus in life is studying astrology in solitude, which is often difficult since he still lives at and studies in his parent's house. His parent's would rather he date and get married. He takes on this task with verve. Not knowing how to approach women in a romantic way, he watches how other men operate and tries to emulate them, most often without success. He ends up attracting the one woman he doesn't really want, a fun loving woman named Laurence who lives next door, but he becomes obsessed with Stella, a singer he sees on television. He believes her love song is being sung directly to him. As Pierre tries to get away from Laurence while pursuing Stella, he may miss the perfect match who may be right under his nose.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was lucky enough to see twice this excellent film -and YOYO- in Buenos Aires, 20 years ago. Two main influences can be traced down in this film, which is like a great homage to silent comedies: first, of course, as Etaix himself put it, that of Buster Keaton (SEVEN CHANCES, SPITE MARRIAGE, CAMERAMAN), but also, it must be said, that of Harry Langdon (TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP & LONG PANTS). Just see and compare, for instance: the scene when the hero carries upstairs in his arms, step by step, the fainted woman (LONG PANTS); his difficulties to manage her body and to put her to bed (SPITE MARRIAGE); the hero driven mad by amour fou, covering the walls of his room with the photos of her girl (TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP), following her (CAMERAMAN), etc.</p>
