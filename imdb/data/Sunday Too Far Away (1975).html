<h1>Sunday Too Far Away (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A hard-drinking but hard-working gun shearer leads a group of Outback sheep herders into striking after wealthy landowners attempt to drive them from their territory.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A delightful Australian film produced in the 1970's that captures the true essence of the Australian character and Australian bush in the 1950's. This is an unashamedly "male" film that results in the cry "Ducks on the Pond" when female's venture into their domain.Sunday Too Far Away is almost a documentary of one 1955 shearing run in outback South Australia.  Minor events like the coming and going of the first Chef become immensely interesting when viewed through the lives of these characters.If you are interested in Australian film, this one is not to be missed.</p>
