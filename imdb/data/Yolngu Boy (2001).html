<h1>Yolngu Boy (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lorrpu, Botj and Milika are three Yolngu (Aboriginal) teenagers who once shared a childhood dream of becoming great hunters together. But as teenagers they changed: Botj did bad things which landed him in jail one time, and Milika is more interested in being a good football player and in chicks! Only Lorrpu is still closer to Aboriginal traditions and to their common dream. One night Botj goes too far and he's about to return to jail. Lorrpu must weigh up his own future against saving the future of his friend. Therefore the three boys start to trek to Darwin to argue Botj's case with tribal leader Dawu. To survive during their hard journey in the bush and the forest, they must use the ancient Aboriginal knowledge, Botj's street instinct, and the bonds of their friendship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>having been to the world premiere of this film in darwin last night i would like to give you all an idea about it. made by local film-maker Stephen Johnson, "Yolngu Boy" (pronounced "YOLNOO") is a fantastic effort by a first-time feature maker who struggled to get this made for 10 years. It showcases the top-ends' beautiful and haunting scenery very well and will do much to inspire others up here in Darwin and the Northern Territory. The story is the best aboriginal content film i have seen and the three young men starring are excellent even though none have acted before, actually i think that is a huge plus. the one criticism i have is the camera work which (particularly in the first half of the film) has way too much movement and is unnecessarily used when filming less than action. it made me feel a bit seasick. when used appropriately, and it certainly was at some times, it is a great effect....but not ALL the time. the helicopter shots of the coast of Arnhem Land are nothing short of spectacular and the truth of the lives of these young aboriginal boys struggling between the old world and the new is touching and inspiring. First rate effort. Support Aussie films AND do yourselves a favour all over the world by seeing this film....you will enjoy and learn.</p>
