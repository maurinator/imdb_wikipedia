<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first heard about this, I couldn't wait to see it, mainly because of Heath Ledger, as I wanted to see if he could pull it off, and do you know what? He does, and it's not surprising.The film is based on the ''Z-Boys'' and how they revolutionized skateboarding in the 1970's.Firstly, the acting is strong. Heath Ledger is mesmerising as ''Skip Engblom'' (the Z-Boy's mentor), who resembles Johnny Depp's ''Jack Sparrow''. Ledger plays the drunken and swaggering Engblom effectively, and is the most charismatic on screen. Ledger has stage presence and is the heart and soul of the film.Meanwhile he is supported well by the array of young actors within the film. Actually, although not as great as Heath Ledger, Michael Angarano gives an energetic performance as ''Sid'' and later an emotional performance, which is bound to send tears to some.The film is directed well by director Catherine Hardwicke, who later directed Twilight. With her directing and Stacey Peralta's writing the movie is an overall entertaining, funny yet emotional and energetic piece of film-making.</p>
