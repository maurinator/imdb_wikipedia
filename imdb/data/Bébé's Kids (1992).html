<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The comedy routines, sketches and characters of the late, great comedian Robin Harris were adapted into a film for this 1992 Paramount release. An animated incarceration of Harris finally goes on a long awaited first date with his new girlfriend and gets more than he ever bargained for when she brings along four extremely rowdy young charges and changes their originally planned quiet setting into a wild and noisy trip to an amusement park called Fun World. The kids are hilarious and are the best part of this really raucous animated film comparable to the cult animation films and techniques of Ralph Bakshi. Not as explicit as one might expect but some mild profanity and blue humor may make some parents want to keep this one away from their kids.</p>
