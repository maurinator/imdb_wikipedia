<h1>Wing Commander (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the mid-27th century, the Terran Confederation is at war with the felinoid Kilrathi Empire. After destroying a Terran base, the Kilrathi have seized a NAVCOM unit with the hyperspace jump coordinates to Earth. With Terran reinforcements scheduled to arrive two hours after the Kilrathi hit Earth, it falls upon the starfighter carrier TCS Tiger Claw to keep the Kilrathi busy.</p>
<p>The descendants of the first ones to travel space are regarded as people of lesser worth. Half a millennium after the first ships launched in search of a better life, the Pilgrims still are discriminated. When the Kilrathi declare war against the human race, it is up to Christopher Blair, Pilgrim halfling, to help avoid complete annihilation. Since the Kilrathi managed to conquer a Navcom unit, they know the jump coordinates to Earth. And since the terran fleet is two hours further away from home than the Kilrathi fleet, the only hope of Mankind is to set trust in a Pilgrim, who can astrogate by feeling and does not need a Navcom unit - it's all genetics.</p>
<p>Blair, a fighter pilot, joins an interstellar war to fight the evil Kilrathi who are trying to destroy the universe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A lot of negative reviews have been given about Wing Commander which I find slightly upsetting. People have been saying the plot was extremely weak and that the Kilrathi monsters were very poorly done. A few comments have also been made as to the quality of acting in the movie. The movie at this point has earned a 4.7/10 IMDb user's rating which I feel is undeservingly low. I will not try to defend the movie as a "great and timeless" movie, for it was not. However, considering a $27 million budget, the movie was very well presented. I mean, to release a Sci-Fi movie, which relies very heavily on costly special effects, for such a small amount of money must have been a very difficult task. Look at Titanic, it was a romance and the special effects involved recreating a Ship and making it Sink, now granted they were good effects and Titanic was a good movie, but it also had a budget of $200 million. As for the actors I feel they did a superb job portraying the characters, especially Matthew Lillard who gave "Maniac" a lovable character and portrayed the original Maniac from the video game series very well. The plot, though not very strong, had enough flow to give the movie a sense of direction and having played the game, I understood the concepts easily. Another point not many people have touched upon is how Chris Roberts used many tactical elements from the gaming series. Involving torpedoes and the use of bombers to attack capital ships, and jump points as opposed to simple "warp" or "hyperdrive". In this, sense he kept very true to the game series. Before watching the movie, I did not really expect much from the special effects with the knowledge of the low budget but surprisingly the effects were very, very well done (except for a few close ups of the Rapiers when you can tell they are using a model with a computer generated background). The Kilrathi were poorly done but there is not enough exposure of them to take too much away from the movie, again budget constraints have hurt them in this department. However, the dogfights, capital ships, battle scenes, and backgrounds were quite stunning and had me very surprised. I think the movie provides a good opportunity for franchise possibilities if done right. Also keep in mind that this was Chris Robert's debut on the big screens and if the Wing Commander games have taught us anything at all is that Chris adapts well and learns from his mistakes. If there is a Wing Commander 2 (The movie of course) look for it to be quite a step up from this Wing Commander, especially if they get a bigger budget. I think the Wing Commander concept has great potential and after all is considered I think an excellent job was done on this movie. In comparison to other movies in this genre I would give it a 7.3/10</p>
