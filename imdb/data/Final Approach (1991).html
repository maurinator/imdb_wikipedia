<h1>Final Approach (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Col. Jason Halsey (USAF) has just had a terrible air disaster and can't remember a thing -- even his name. Now he must go head-to-head with the psychiatrist Dr. Gottlieb as his only chance to recover his memory. Col. Halsey is a stealth fighter test pilot in the highly classified project Black Magic. Is Dr. Gottlieb a helping professional or is he a counter-intelligence agent sent to debrief Halsey? This movie draws considerable footage from the Lockheed Corp. documentary "Blackbird: The Movie" for its background material on the SR-71 spy plane.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have watched this film at least twenty times and have always come away rewarded. The search for action, adventure, are fruitless. However the twists and depth, and the ability of Elizondo to disrupt your train of thought are amazing. This film gets into your head. The comparisons to Jacob's Ladder are trivial. This film relies on subtlety, and misdirection, to bring you in, as opposed to the shock and "underground governmental experiment" genre that was conveyed in Jacob's Ladder. Any adult who has respect for cutting edge film making, needs to see this.</p>
