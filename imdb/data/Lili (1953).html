<h1>Lili (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Members of a circus troupe "adopt" Lili Daurier when she finds herself stranded in a strange town.

Will she get her heart's desire?</p>
<p>Lili, a poor French girl, has nowhere to go after her father dies. She meets Marc, and follows him home. "Home" turns out to be a carnival, where Marc is the magician, and Marc turns out to be romantically unavailable. The only friends Lili makes are the puppets in the puppet show. She does not like the carnival owner, but he is the puppeteer!</p>
<p>An orphaned young woman becomes part of a puppet act and forms a relationship with the anti-social puppeteer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Last night, driving with a friend, she popped a CD into the player in her car and Jimmy Durante's voice sang a song I had not heard in about 35 years "Hi-Lili Hi-Lo." The emotion of this movie that I saw as a young child,perhaps six years old, came rushing back to me. I don't remember a lot of things from when I was six but I do remember being entranced and a bit haunted by the movie Lili. I was easily able to relate to Lili's encounter with the puppets that became her confidants and friends when the adult world became too hard to handle. The initial charm of the magician character that, as all too often became the case for people in my young life, turned to emotional unavailability. The course by which Lili's fear of the puppeteer gets dissolved through understanding. And most of all the hauntingly beautiful song and dance sequence.I don't remember much of the plot but I am very much looking forward to seeing this movie again. If it was available on DVD I would immediately buy it for my own children.</p>
