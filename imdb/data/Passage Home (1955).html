<h1>Passage Home (1955)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The ol' man and the sea .... The grumpy captain(well acted by finch) is a lech and a drunk in this obscure film - one guaranteed not to be memorable. Diane cilento must have had an inkling of whats to happen being the only female(and a good looking one at that) on board .Overlong ,unbelievable and doldrummic.</p>
