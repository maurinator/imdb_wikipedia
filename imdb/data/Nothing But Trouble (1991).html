<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very funny as well as a very entertaining sashay in and out of the world of weird. If you're rigid with your own expectations, do yourself a favor and expect to to be generous with your poetic license chits. The movie jumps in and out (a lotta out) of the real world from start to finish, never getting comfortable for those predisposed to not get comfortable with stuff like this. The show comes off as so stupid that even when it's clever it still looks stupid. By the third watch, nothing about this movie is stupid. Most everything is funny by then. And so, the litmus test. If you meet someone, and there's a romantic spark, and that person 'admits' that they really like the movie, you've found your soul mate. And if you meet someone who says the movie was 'soo stupid', you've met ont of the soldiers tha comprise the 'masses'... OOOOhhh, I said it.</p>
