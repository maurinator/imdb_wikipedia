<h1>Real Men (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jim Belushi plays a super-competent secret agent on the trail of Russian thugs. John Ritter plays a milquetoast dad who gets mixed up in the caper. The story follows their adventures over the course of a week, in which Ritter develops some guts and Belushi gets in touch with his sensitive side.</p>
<p>A womanizing CIA agent and an insecure insurance agent are paired together to make sure a deal goes through with aliens for the future of mankind.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Putting these two together was genius! Belushi and Ritter complement each others personalities like Matthau and Lemmon...but funnier! The premise of this movie is quirky and original, all through the movie there is some unexpected surprise to throw you. I really could relate to Ritter's character and found myself cheering at the end! A least rent this movie if you haven't seen it, you WON'T be disappointed!</p>
