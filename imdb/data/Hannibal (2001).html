<p>The continuing saga of Hannibal Lecter, the murdering cannibal. He is presently in Italy and works as a curator at a museum.

One high ranking official, Paul Krendler has it in for her. But she gets a reprieve because Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims who is looking to get back at Lecter for what Lecter did to him, wants to use Starling to lure him out. When Lecter sends her a note she learns that he's in Italy so she asks the police to keep an eye out for him.
