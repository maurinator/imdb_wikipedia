<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Girl's Night is a bit sentimental for my taste and there were fewer funny lines than I expected but the performances are the thing and both "girls" are superb and great foils for one another.I particularly enjoyed the Las Vegas section as I was there last year so it all came back.</p>
