<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>James Mason gives a tour-de-force performance as a tired clerk who knows not who to trust.  Hildegrade Knef is magnificent in a complex supporting role. Carol Reed has directed some great movies and this is among his best.  The ending sequence is so poignant, it always brings tears to the eyes.</p>
