<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw China Corsair when it first came out in 1951. Ernest Borgnine playeda curio shopkeeper in Chinatown. Soon after this we saw him catapulted tofame in From Here To Eternity, and eventually in Marty and others.This is Borgnine's third feature film, according to the imdb. It has apparently never been available on video. It would be instructive to have it on VHS orDVD, even as just a curiosity. Among other things, does he pass easily for aSouthern Chinese? From my distant childhood memory, I think so.</p>
