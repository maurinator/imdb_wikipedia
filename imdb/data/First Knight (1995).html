<h1>First Knight (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lancelot lives by the sword. In fact, they're next door neighbours, so teaming up to fight for money comes pretty naturally. Lady Guinevere, on her way to marry King Arthur is ambushed by the evil Sir Malagant. Fortunately Lancelot is lurking nearby and he rescues his future queen. They fall in love, but Guinevere still fancies the idea of wearing a crown, so she honours her promise to Arthur. Can Lady Guinevere remain faithful, or will this Pretty Woman become a lady of the knight?</p>
<p>After King Arthur of Camelot has fought several wars which has led to peace and justice for his land, he is turning his attention to thoughts of marriage, his chosen one being Lady Guinevere, who has become head of neighboring Leonesse following the death of her father. Peace and justice for Arthur and Guinevere are short lived as Prince Malagant, one of the knights of the round table, wants Camelot for himself and King Arthur deposed. Many in the land follow Malagant, whose quest also involves marauding Leonesse. As the King's betrothed, Guinevere becomes Malagant's target in achieving both his goals. Meanwhile, Lancelot is a free-living peasant who often makes his way through life by demonstrations of his sword fighting prowess. His skill is largely due to his ability to assess his opponents, and not fear dying. On Malagant's first attempt at abducting Guinevere, Lancelot, by happenstance, is there to save her. He falls in love with her at first sight. Although attracted to the man who saved her, Guinevere cannot think of any other man in the lead up to her marriage to Arthur. Because of his attraction to Guinevere, Lancelot becomes involved in the battles between Malagant and Arthur in Lancelot doing whatever needed to keep Guinevere safe. As these battles brew and as Arthur becomes indebted to Lancelot for saving Guinevere at the possible expense of his own life, Guinevere cannot help but fall for Lancelot, resulting in a romantic triangle comprised of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, a triangle of which Arthur is unaware.</p>
<p>A rebel knight from King Arthur's round table seeks to expand his empire by force, and terrorises the subjects of Guinevere, who has received an offer of marriage from Arthur. On the way to visit Arthur she has a chance meeing with the free-spirited and bohemian Lancelot, to whom she finds herself attracted.</p>
<p>Merlin, Excalibur and all things supernatural are out of this picture, as King Arthur, aged and war-weary is forced to go to battle one last time against the traitor Prince Malagant, whilst in the meantime his new bride Guinevere and new knight Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way.</p>
<p>Lancelot falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur. Meanwhile, a violent warlord tries to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film deserves recognition for what it is : a good interpretation of part of a legend, with an excellent casting.Who else but Sean Connery as an ageing and dignified King Arthur ?Julia Ormond is a convincing and stunning princess with her graceful, touching beauty; her looks are also refreshing and different from all the ever-present boring blondes who get a part in anything because of their hair colour.As for Richard Gere he is as handsome, charming and fearless as Camelot would be.This film is not for historians or purists nor does it claim to have a documentary value. It has a sense of magic and the pace is well alternated between romance and action. The emotion and intensity are present thanks to the actors and the music, appropriate to all the scenes in the movie. That is what matters.Who cares about details such as a castle looking a bit dodgy, blue clothes (we have seen much worse and tackier in cinema history) or the odd line or fact. Never mind that. Just relax and escape : it is only entertainment at the end of the day, not a time for History or Legend Reconstruction. You are better off going to a course or reading a book, do not rely on films to educate you all the time.Why comparing films ? Let's just say there are different approaches to a subject, that is what makes the interest. Enjoy !</p>
