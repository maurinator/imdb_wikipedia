<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen most of Elvis' films by now, though I do have some more to go... but I think I'm pretty secure in my feeling that KISSIN' COUSINS is surely one of the worst of them all. It's a dumb comedy that's not even funny, with Elvis playing twin cousins, one a dark-haired army man and the other a blond hillbilly. Presley is in the army when he's sent along with his commander (Jack Albertson) to the backwoods mountains to convince his redneck relatives to allow the government to install a missile base on their property. Yvonne Craig plays one of the many hillbilly gals who's sweet on her own cuz. All of the songs here are pretty awful, though the fast version of the title track works during the closing dance sequence. But I was often so bored that I found myself regularly checking out the dual Elvis characters whenever they were in the same shot to see if I could spot the stand-in, who shifts duties from blond to brunette, as needed. *1/2 out of ****</p>
