<h1>Two Tickets to Broadway (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young and inexperienced Nancy Peterson leaves her hometown of Pelican Falls, Vermont, to try to make it big on Broadway. Along the way, she meets Hannah Holbrook, Joyce Campbell and S.F. "Foxy" Rogers, three struggling and starving chorines who are heading back to New York after a disastrous run on a showboat in Vermont. In New York, Nancy also meets baritone Dan Carter, who is thinking about heading back to his hometown of Denver after two years of getting nowhere on Broadway. Beyond meeting Nancy, what Hannah, Joyce, Foxy and Dan also have in common is that they are each represented by Lou Conway, a somewhat shyster of an agent who relies on the good-natured if somewhat reluctant funding of local deli owners Leo and Harry to advance Hannah, Joyce, Foxy and Dan's careers. Regardless, Hannah loves Lou, the two who are engaged. To appease most specifically Dan, Lou comes up with his latest scheme to make his name known to the public: move to a new medium - television - by getting him a spot on Bob Crosby's variety show, which requires not just Dan singing, but a complete act with four pretty and talented chorines backing him up. Dan and the four girls agree, especially after Dan runs into Dennis McGiven, Bob Crosby's producer, who as much as guarantees Dan such a spot if the act is good. As Dan and the girls prepare a routine, what they are unaware of is that Dennis McGiven was not who he appeared, but was a plant by Lou to further the scheme. All Lou has to do is get Dan and the girls really onto the show. In the process of rehearsals, Dan and Nancy fall in love. But it may all fall apart if their professional aspirations cannot be met by Lou, or if some misunderstandings come to pass because of Lou's swindle.</p>
<p>Nancy Peterson and her friends want to get a spot on Bob Crosby's TV show, but their agent has linked them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Designed partially as a showcase for RKO owner Howard Hughes girlfriend, Janet Leigh. Hughes could afford to import quite a lot of first rate talent in the effort, mostly from best in the musical business MGM. Current or former MGM talent included Leigh, Ann Miller, Gloria DeHaven, and Tony Martin, along with musical number director Busby Berkeley. Leigh proved herself competent as a singer and dancer, and is certainly pleasant in personality and a pleasure to look at.In the musical numbers featuring the four "girls", Gloria DeHaven is the standout (sorry Ann Miller fans). DeHaven sings superbly, handles the dancing with aplomb, has just the right mix of charisma, humor, sincerity, and takes a back seat to no one in the beauty department.I thought the musical numbers well staged and mostly very pleasant (exception the very banal Pellican Falls school song). The comedy of Smith and Dale, I could live without, if you'll excuse the expression. And Eddie Bracken is too frenetic and broad in his comedy for my taste.Though none of the songs became a standard, a couple are excellent; I especially enjoyed "The Worry Bird", and "The Closer You Are" has a gorgeous melody.All in all, the film is the equal of many of the lower budget MGM musicals, and that ain't bad at all.</p>
