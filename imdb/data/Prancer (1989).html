<h1>Prancer (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jessica, the daughter of an impoverished farmer, still believes in Santa Claus. So when she comes across a reindeer with an injured leg, it makes perfect sense to her to assume that it is Prancer, who had fallen from a Christmas display in town. She hides him in her barn and feeds him cookies, until she can return him to Santa. Her father finds him and decides to sell him to the butcher, not for venison chops, but as an advertising display.</p>
<p>A farm girl nurses a wounded reindeer she believes is one of Santa's, hoping to bring it back to health in time for Christmas. Her holiday spirit inspires those around her, something her disheartened father is having trouble understanding.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>With all of the hype that surrounds the many Christmas releases and remakes, here's an original that all of the family should see.  It is sweet yet real. It restores hope and decency to movies.We've rented it before, now we own it.  After "A Christmas Story" and the Alistaire Sim version of "A Christmas Carol", this is the Christmas movie our family MUST watch every year.</p>
