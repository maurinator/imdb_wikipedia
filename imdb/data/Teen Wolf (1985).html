<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anyone else ever get emotional at the end of this movie? It may seem overly sensitive to get choked up about an ending like that but that is why Michael J. Fox is great. No other actor could have pulled off that ending in a movie like this. Everything about the ending is perfect. There is no doubt that the ending was the typical happy ending to fun and goofy 80's movie but I always thought the ending of the movie had a little extra special feeling to it. From the moment that the second foul shot goes in and Amy Holland's Shooting for the Moon begins until the screen goes from freeze frame w/ MJF being held in his dad's arms while he kisses the head of Boof to black as the credits roll is a stretch of great emotion for the viewer in my opinion. The Amy Holland song is excellent and I have it on MP3 and burned the song to my best movie soundtracks mix. The whole ending to that movie always is great no matter how many times you've seen it. There are so many awesome things about that ending but I'll spare everyone my babbling about all of the great things that transpire at the end of this movie. Criticize its so called "cheesiness," as some people eluded to in other comments, all you like but each person who is critical of and concentrated on that aspect is just being sheltered about the child that is inside of everyone. Come on people just let loose and enjoy a true feel good movie with the classic storybook ending that all humans want to see. Why does everything always have to be realistic?! This movie is an enduring classic film from the 80's and deserves more credit that it has received over the years."When your shooting for the moon and finally make it. I guess a lucky star is shining on you. The candle on the cake is yours so take it, make another wish it's sure to come true. Isn't that the way you do it? Maybe I could do it to..."-Amy Holland, Shooting For The Moon, Teen Wolf main theme song, 1985.</p>
