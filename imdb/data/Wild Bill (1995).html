<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Is it the will to fight? Is it the fear of failure? Quoting one of the most important lines in this movie: "Wild Bill had chosen a way of life, that  demanded he´d walk down the muddy mainstreet, instead of using the sidewalks along the houses.", one begins to realize that legend  has its price. Now, it may not be a historical correct version of the life and death of the great Wild Bill, but it´s a lesson on what happens when the your name gets to carry you, instead of the other way around. -and Jeff Bridges is simply superb as the uncompromising and stubborn gunslinger. Great Movie!!!</p>
