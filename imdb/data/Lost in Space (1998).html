<h1>Lost in Space (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the year 2058, the Earth will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of pollution and global warming! Professor John Robinson, lead scientist of the Jupiter 2 Mission, will lead his family to the habitable planet Alpha Prime to prep it for colonization. The Jupiter 2 is equipped with a hyperdrive that allows faster-than-light travel, which will eventually be employed to evacuate the citizens of Earth. However hypergates must be constructed on Earth and Alpha Prime to provide stable points of departure and arrival. Dr. Zachary Smith is bribed by a terrorist organization to sabotage the mission, and ends up an unwilling stowaway as the ship blasts off.</p>
<p>In the near future, earth's fossil resources are about to be used up. In an attempt to save the human race, scientists have begun building a gate, through which faster than light travel will be possible - but only if there is a gate at the destination to receive the travelers. The Robinson Family has been chosen to travel to Alpha Prime - the only other inhabitable planet known - at normal speed, ten years, cryogenically frozen. But Dr. Smith, a sinister man, sabotages their spaceship, Jupiter 2, but is also betrayed by his people. So, he has to work together with the Robinsons in order to survive himself. When Jupiter 2 is falling into the sun, the only chance to survive is to activate the hyperdrive - without a gate at the other end. Soon, the Robinsons are someplace really unknown, where they meet unfriendly silicon-based space spiders, take in a little ape-like creature and name new star systems after Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. They have to reach Alpha Prime in order to build the second gate, or earth's only hope is gone.</p>
<p>With the Earth running short of natural energy resources the Jupiter mission to colonize and exploit Alpha Prime seems to be the only chance of survival. Professor John Robinson ('William Hurt' ) together with his wife Maureen, his family and fighter pilot Don West (lead a desperate attempt to create a Hyper-Gate in orbit around the planet Alpha Prime to enable the rescue of Earth to begin. However, others have different reasons for reaching Alpha Prime and Dr. Smith sabotages the Jupiter 2 but fails to get clear and becomes an unwelcome stowaway aboard the ship. To escape the gravitational pull of the sun the Hyper-Drive is fired and the Jupiter 2, after a trip through hyperspace, emerges into a completely unknown part of the galaxy. A search of the star charts reveals that they are completely lost in an uncharted sector of space but this is only the beginning of their problems...</p>
<p>The year is 2058. Most of the Earth's natural resources are virtually exhausted and will no longer support human life. The government decides that another planet shall be the human race's new home and the government begins construction of two "Hypergates" that will allow the human race to travel across space to the distant planet Alpha Prime. Government scientist Professor John Robinson, decides to set up a vital space mission. Along with his family: His wife Maureen, their children, oldest daughter, medical officer Judy, troubled teenage daughter, video technician Penny and their youngest son, gifted robotics expert Will and joined by heroic military fighter pilot Major Don West, John and his crew travels to Alpha Prime on-board the spaceship "Jupiter 2". But the traitorous Dr. Zachary Smith, working for terrorists known as the Seditions, uses the ship's robot and sabotages the mission and sends "Jupiter 2" off-course. But as Jupiter 2 is caught in the gravitational pull of the sun, John uses the ship's hyper-drive to escape. But John, his family and Major West learns that they've entered a uncharted part of the galaxy and they are lost in space.</p>
<p>The Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity. Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having watched this movie, it's easy to believe a producer and writer, sitting drunk at a table one night, saying "Hey ... how about this.  Lost in Space movie.  Throw in some well known faces, some big special effects, a cute overly shiny alien, and something about time travel.  Doesn't need to make sense."The actors have done well, considering the script is full of cliches and plotholes, and none turn in bad performances.  In fact, without William Hurt and Gary Oldman, the movie would have been far worse.  The special effects, the costumes, set design are all very well done, but the failure of the movie comes down to the bad script.  Besides taking lines directly out of other movies (Back to the Future is just one ... "where the hell ..." "the question is WHEN the hell ..."), and phrases that were considered well-worn when the original series was around, there are "huggy moments" throughout the script which makes you feel the writer is beating you over the head with a "warm fuzzy hammer".  Penny's problems magically solved?  West and Judy finally realising they like each other after all?  Father and son reaffirming their love?  It's like a mix between Plan 9 From Outer Space and Steel Magnolias.And don't even think about the poor "time travel / alternate universe" scenario.  There are so many contradictions and badly-thought out ideas surrounding that, it could physically injure you if you tried to contemplate it for too long.A sequel isn't as terrifying an idea as it may first sound ... with the same cast and crew, it may even be enjoyable.  But please, a better script next time, for goodness sake.</p>
