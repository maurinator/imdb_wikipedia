<h1>Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jonathan is sick and tired of the boring life in his sea-gull clan. He rather experiments with new, always more daring flying techniques. Since he doesn't fit in, the elders expel him from the clan. So he sets out to discover the world beyond the horizon in quest for wisdom.</p>
<p>A skilled flyer but very rebellious young seagull is kicked out of his clan. However, instead of being sad or lonely, he decides to enjoy and explore his newfound freedom.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sorry I disagree with some of the others here, this is one beautiful film, in story, photography, music.  Neil Diamond's score is first rate, the the film is unlike any other made....beautiful and full of feeling. If you don't have a heart and hate beauty, skip it. If you do, don't miss it, it's really a work of art.</p>
