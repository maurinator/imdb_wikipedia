<h1>Two Bits (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's a hot summer day in 1933 in South Philly, where 12-year old Gennaro lives with his widowed mom and his ailing grandpa, who sits outside holding tight to his last quarter, which he's promised to Gennaro and which Gennaro would like to have to buy a ticket to the plush new movie theater. But grandpa's not ready to pass on the quarter or pass on to his final reward: he has some unfinished business with a woman from his past, and he enlists Gennaro to act as his emissary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is really good. If you like Italian, if you have a touch of sentimentalism in you, if you like Pacino (who doesn't)& if you're nostalgic for films about yesteryear (1930's, The Great Depression), then this one'll be a treat for you.Twelve year old Gennaro wants to go to the "air-cooled" La Paloma Movie House. He needs 25 cents but money is hard to come by at this time. The kid is resourceful though. He's willing to work for his goal. Jobs are scarce & people are dying from lack of food & things they cannot afford like medicine. "Grampa Pacino" is on his death-bed out in the back yard but he 'can't die' until he gets forgiven for something he did decades ago. He gets his grandson to ask the person for forgiveness - THEN he can have the 25 cents. I really like the closeness of these two characters. I don't know where this young Jerry Barone (Gennaro) came from but he's a good actor & he's handsome. (He could probably play Hispanic, too.) So enjoy a bit of the old country with Two Bits. You'll be surprised. There's nothing' sappy about it. It's for everyone...</p>
