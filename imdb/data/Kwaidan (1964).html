<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima did a marvellous job, although most of the visuals in this masterpiece are obviously invented by Kobayashi.  It is clearly studio-work, but Kobayashi turns that to his advance by making the most marvellous background paintings I've ever seen in a movie and his virtuosity comes to full exposure in the light effects that are fabulous for such an old film.  That together with the beautiful colors creates a mesmerizing and sometimes terrifying experience.  'Marco the magnificent' (Patelliere&Howard, 1964) reminded me of the visuals in Kwaidan, because of the beautiful environmental shots and because of the (supposed) history of mixture of eastern and western stories.  Forget that movie instantly plz.  Another film that has nothing to do with this one, but is brilliant and comparable only because of the episode structure, the fairy-tale nature and great cinematography is Kaos (Taviani, 1984).Kwaidan has such a haunting effect because of the scary music and the sound effects are unnerving(-ly edited).  Some call it horror.  I thought the pace was rather slow for horror, but it is a film that does not let go easily.  The actors (one of which is Takeshi Shimura) convince enthusiastically and they too make it an entertaining film.  According to the user-rating this is Kobayashi's least interesting work of these three: Joi-uchi, Seppuku, and Kwaidan.  I can't wait to see the other two, although I don't think they can surpass this masterpiece.10 points out of 10 :-)</p>
