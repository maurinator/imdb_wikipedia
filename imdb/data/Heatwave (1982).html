<h1>Heatwave (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A planned housing development in the mid 70's designed for an upstart Cockney immigrant developer, becomes the centre of controversy as tenants and squatters in the older houses refuse to move.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This classic Australian film by veteran director Phillip Noyce probably deserves more credit than it gets. It's not as good as Noyce's recent Rabbit-Proof Fence or 1978's Newsfront, but the talent it has to offer is quite impressive with stars such as Judy Davis and Bill Hunter. It won't appeal to everybody, but it's still worth a look at - especially if you're into the Australian film industry.</p>
