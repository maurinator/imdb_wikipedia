<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was definitely one of my favorite Saturday morning cartoon movies when I was a child. The characters were extremely fun, the storyline was relatively complex, and the tone was not that of most condescending animated movies that caused me, even as a very young child, to feel as if the movies were talking down to me.I haven't seen the movie in quite a few years, but I do remember watching it in late middle school or early high school and noting some of the political ideas that it seemed to be expressing. (By this time, I had realized how the media had affected  my mind and opinion about political issues. For example, my once inexplicable cautious attitude towards Eastern Europeans [which have since been eradicated] could probably be trace to such propaganda films as Rocky IV.)However, I do think this film is pretty harmless and actually delivers some good lessons that a child of any age needs to learn. It's definitely still on my favorites list.</p>
