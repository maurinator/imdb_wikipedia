<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Bob Clark ("Porkys," "Murder By Decree," "A Christmas Story") films one of his best ever here. When an off duty fireman (Robert Urich)attempts to save a child from a burning building, he is injured. But due to the fact he had been at a local bar at the time of the fire, the city of New York deny's him his earned and justified Pension. When his younger brother (Timothy Hutton) tries to get some justice for his brother he is rebuffed by everyone including an arrogant Mayor (Robert Culp)of New York. After his brother is blamed and arrested by the police for a minor bit of mischief that he is responsible for, Jimmy Lynch fights back, using a plan that will literally drive the politico nuts. Also stars Peter Boyle as an over the edge cop, and Daren McGavin as a police detective. Kim Catrall is a social worker that wants to help Jimmy in the end. This film is one of those feel good movies, with a lot of good moments and a fine understated moral. With this one Bob Clark is a modern day Aesop.Most definitely worth a watch.</p>
