<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An afternoon of complete JOY hearing Mario Lanza singing....also and an extra in hearing Doretta Morrow. Lanza's Granada was electrifying. One of the nice extras of retirement is being able to enjoy the afternoon or evening in such heavenly company.The total music in this movie is superb. Anyone who enjoys music no matter what age should enjoy Lanza's movies. They should be a teaching tool for singers and musicians of all ages. Today we are not teaching our children to appreciate fine music and to enjoy listening and learning about what it means to the heart and soul. Truly these movies are masterpieces of art and should be treated as such.Rose Clary</p>
