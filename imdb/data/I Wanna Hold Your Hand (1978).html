<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>If they missed Beatles' first appearance in the U.S.A. they would hate themselves for the rest of their lives! So they (six teenagers from New Jersey) set off even though they don't have tickets for the show! The journey is full of surprises and misfortunes but the young ladies are determined to reach to their idols...</p>
<p>Beatlemania has swept the US, most specifically New York City, on the eve of The Beatles' first ever performance in the country on The Ed Sullivan Show (1948) on Sunday, February 9, 1964. Teenaged friends Pam Mitchell, Grace Corrigan and Rosie Petrofsky of nearby Maplewood, New Jersey are as big Beatles fans as anyone. Grace, who wants to take exclusive photographs of the Beatles to launch her photojournalism career, comes up with a plan for the three of them to get into the hotel where the Beatles are staying. Pam goes along despite her own previous plans to elope with her boyfriend Eddie Lupus the next night, the night of the show. Also along for the ride are their friend Janis Goldman, whose primary activity in life is to protest for a cause (in this case how the Beatles have unfairly taken over all aspect of life), tough guy Tony Smerko who hates the "Limey fairies" but loves Janis, and Larry Dubois whose father has the necessary vehicle to pull off the plan. As they arrive at the hotel on the morning of the show, as the Beatles themselves move between the hotel and the studio for their rehearsal and performance, and as the friends try to track the Beatles movements during the day, the friends get separated. But their day is spent with other people who have their own Beatles related objectives.</p>
<p>Six teenagers from Maplewood, New Jersey in various stages of Beatlemania travel to New York City for the first appearance of the Fab Four on the "Ed Sullivan Show." At the start of the film, none have tickets, but all find their way to the studio for the fantastic climax.</p>
<p>Six teenagers from New Jersey run off to go to a Beatles concert to meet their idols, despite not having tickets. Along the way, they learn new things about friendship and growing up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is a scene that takes place about three quarters of the way through this film that is not only one of the ten funniest scenes in the history of movie-making, but probably does even a better job of summing up what the year 1964 was all about than  Dr. Strangelove. It involves Christian Juttner, who must confront an evil looking one-eyed barber, and a snake-like pair of electric clippers.And forget Burt Lancaster & Deborah Kerr on the beach in "From Here To Eternity." For sheer lustful passion, that scene doesn't even come close to Nancy Allen's roll in the hay with Paul McCartney's Hoffner bass.A flawless masterpiece!</p>
