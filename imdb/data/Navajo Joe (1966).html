<h1>Navajo Joe (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Native American warrior called Navajo Joe seeks revenge on a gang of sadistic outlaws who has massacred the people of his tribe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As in Django, Corbucci has here created a memorable loner anti-hero who dispenses his own brand of justice.  Great job by Burt Reynolds as Navajo Joe; great soundtrack by Morricone (recently sampled as the "shock music" in the movie Election).</p>
