<h1>High Season (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the isle of Rhodes, Katherine, an expatriate English photographer, lives with her daughter. A young local wants to encourage tourism, so he commissions a sculpture of the Unknown Tourist for the town square; the sculptor he brings to Rhodes is Kate's ex-husband. Also there to see Kate is Sharp, an aging antiquarian and her dear friend. He has something important to tell her. As Kate, her ex, and Sharp sort out things that go back years, two English tourists bumble about, one thinking he's fallen in love with Kate, his wife thinking she's found her own lover. A rare vase, a spy, old friendships, the statue's unveiling, and off-hand English sorting-out play into the resolution.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We originally bought this film to market it as a film oddity...Kenneth Branagh's only nude role. I then throughly enjoyed the Cinematography, the beautiful Landscapes, and the delightful acting job done by Irene Papas. The comedy is subtle it is really a combination of a drama and comedy...a dramedy. Peploe does a nice job bringing interesting characters to the screen. So much so that when Lesley Manville's character makes a mistake you want to cuss her out and when Irene Papas' character pulls some outrageous stunts near the end you can laugh and cheer her on as much as the Greek villagers did in the film. The film does a really nice job conveying the adventure of travelling and will be enjoyed most by people who have traveled some...and of course should also be enjoyed by Islanders of all sorts!</p>
