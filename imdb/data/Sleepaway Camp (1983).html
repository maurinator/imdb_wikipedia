<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is 80's American Cheese at it's greatest!  The cast does a great job and the script is actually really good.  If your a fan of cheesy slasher flicks this is one you should certainly check out...and absolutely DO NOT MISS THE ENDING!!!!  One of the creepiest endings I've ever seen in a movie which is sure to give anyone the chills.   A truly wicked low budget horror flick.</p>
