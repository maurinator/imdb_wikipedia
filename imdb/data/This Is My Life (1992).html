<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just watched this movie for the third time.  I chose to watch it on Mother's Day because this is about as realistic a tale about mother-and-daughter bonding and growing pains as you will ever see.  Julie Kavner is nothing short of amazing as Dotty, a stand-up comic from Ozone Park, Queens, waiting for her chance to make it to the big time.  But, life necessitates tradeoffs.  As her career takes off, Dotty is unable to spend much time with her kids who grow resentful.  And with her older daughter Erica (an excellent performance by Samantha Mathis) now in the awkward early teen years, everything Dotty does is a personal embarrassment to Erica.  The direction is a bit on the claustrophobic and episodic side.  Aside from experimenting with the number of different ways to show polka dots, this is not a visually impressive film, nor is it meant to be.But on its own terms, it is sweet, warm, winning, and true.</p>
