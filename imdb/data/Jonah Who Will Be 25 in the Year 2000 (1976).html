<h1>Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The European equivalent of "The Return of the Secaucus 7," this Swiss film looks at the lives of several men and women in their 30s as they confront the slim gains of the "revolutionary" sixties. Max, a dissatisfied copy editor; Myriam, a redhead into tantric sex; and Marie, a supermarket checker who gives unauthorized discounts to the elderly, search for renewed meaning on a communal farm. The title character, a six-year-old child, is the carrier of their hopes for the future.</p>
<p>Documentary-like social and family analysis, based on the lives of eight people who were together in 1968, and found themselves connected with Jonas, a child of that turning-point year for so many, and who will be 25 y-o in the far distant year 2000... They called themselves "the minor prophets", and the way they "predict" the future is by their daily, common lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie elegantly captures the zeitgeist of ca 1975, seen through individual lives of some Genevans who in minor ways attempt to keep the sparkle of rebellion alive while their dreams from 1968 fade away, facing the reality of the 1970s. Its blend of tongue-in-cheek comedy and melancholy sadness makes it impossible to forget once you've seen it.</p>
