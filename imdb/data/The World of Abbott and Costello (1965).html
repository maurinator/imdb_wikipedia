<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The World of Abbott and Costello (1965) ** (out of 4) This compilation features clips from various Abbott and Costello movies that they comedy legends made at Universal but you know you're in trouble when the director decides to start the film off with footage from ABBOTT AND COSTELLO GO TO MARS, which is considered one of their worst films. This is a pretty weird film to judge because on one hand I can see where it would have been useful when it was released since it probably wasn't so easy to track down and view the 19 Abbott and Costello films that we see clips of here. On the other hand, I really do wonder if director Sidney Miller had some sort of limitations on the clips that he could use because as someone who has seen every single A&C movie, I must admit that I was a little confused at some of the clips they picked. Don't get me wrong, there are some really funny moments to be found here including a nice section where we see the duo selling illegal or weak products on the streets. These moments always made for some great moments. We also get the famous dice scene as well as the one where Abbott tries to borrow $50 from Costello but he only has $40. With that said, there are many questionable clips shown that simply aren't that funny and quite often they take clips from movies that are rather weak and yet leave out much better ones. THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP, RIDE 'EM COWBOY, IN THE NAVY, HIT THE ICE, A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN, THE NAUGHTY NINETIES and BUCK PRIVATES COME HOME are just a few of the films. One other strange thing is the added narration by Jack E. Leonard who usually jumps into scenes with pointless comments. They even have him interrupt during the finale of the Who's On First routine!</p>
