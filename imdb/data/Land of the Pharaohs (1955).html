<h1>Land of the Pharaohs (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In ancient Egypt the Pharaoh Khu-fu is obsessed with acquiring gold and plans to take it all with him into the "second life." To this end he enlists the aid of Vashtar, an architect whose people are enslaved in Egypt. The deal: build a robbery-proof tomb and the enslaved people will be freed. During the years that the pyramid is being built a Cyprian princess becomes the pharaoh's second wife, and she plots to prevent Khufu from taking his treasure with him when he dies .. as well as helping him make the journey early.</p>
<p>Pharaoh Khufu has amassed a fortune in gold and jewels through many years of war. His intention is to have all of his wealth buried with him but worries about grave robbers. He commissions a recently acquired slave, Vashtar - who is also a master architect - to design and build an impregnable burial vault within his pyramid. Meanwhile, an attractive young woman from Cyprus, Nellifer, is sent to Khufu as tribute. She soon becomes his favorite and his second wife. When she sees his treasure, she has every intention of obtaining part of it for herself.</p>
<p>A captured architect designs an ingenious plan to ensure the impregnability of tomb of a self-absorbed Pharaoh, obsessed with the security of his next life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although I know better, I confess I'd rather watch this movie than any number of masterpieces. Jack Hawkins (pharaoh) forces magisterial James Justice (slave Vashtar)to construct an impenetrable pyramid for his cache of loot. Pharaoh runs short of money, forcing subject provinces to cough up the funds to keep the public works project going...the excuse for a breathtaking and youthful Joan Collins to enter the cast, and in short order, to subjugate pharaoh himself. Eternal riches seem rather dull compared to her considerable mortal charms.All of this takes a back seat to the superb coup de main of the last five minutes when all the characters get their wish--for treasure, for power, and the security of eternity.The excellent musical score helps.</p>
