<h1>This Is Cinerama (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A standard screen B&W; prologue during which Lowell Thomas shows how, from the dawn of history, mankind has attempted to create the illusion of depth & movement by artistic, mechanical and photographic means. Cinerama format opens with Rockaway Playland Roller Coaster, then Temple Dance from "Aida", views of Niagra Falls, Long Island Choir - an early test of CineramaSound in B&W; -, Canals of Venice, Edinburgh Military Tattoo, bullfight and musical performance in Spain, Act II finale of "AIDA" at La Scala Opera House, Milan. "Intermission 15 minutes" Act II commences with a sound demonstration - "we call it stereophonic sound" says LT. Then to Cypress Gardens, Florida, for trick water skiing and boating scenes. The last half of Act II- "America the Beautiful"- is viewed from the nose of a low flying B-25 aeroplane. Finally, credits.</p>
<p>This the first of what would prove to be only a limited number of films produced in the Cinerama wide-screen projection process developed by Fred Waller. Hosted and narrated by Lowell Thomas the wide-screen projection is meant to provide an inclusive experience for the viewer. Beginning with an introduction by Thomas where he give a short history of film, he then says 'This is Cinerama' and the viewers find themselves practically seated on a wild roller coaster ride. Broad vistas and swelling music were hallmarks of all Cinerama films.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When shown as intended this showcase demonstrates the potential of the Cinerama systems, their limitations, and gives a glimpse of the world as it was in 1952 in spectacular show-biz style.  It is a technically interesting and fun documentary.  Viewable only on the big screen with three projectors, the real thing, not a simulation, ladies and gentlemen, Cinerama! Having just come from seeing it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, I'm in the mood to hawk its virtues.  It must be admitted that technological advances are rapidly bypassing this type of system, but it is a grand and brazen promotion that deserves to be dragged out periodically to show how it used to be done.  As with any other art, seeing it in person IS the real thing.  Great date movie.  It includes Edisons short "The Kiss" and most of "The Great Train Robbery" as part of its introduction, to give us something with which to compare Cinerama, plus some history of the development of photography as a popular art. We start right off with a whiz-bang roller coaster ride, and proceed right on through the Triumph from "Aida", presented in wonderful operatic splendour by the company at the La Scala opera house.  Boy did I go for that.  After intermission we went to Cyprus Gardens to view its 1952-style wonders, including the famous Auquacade (a dance, stunt and comedy show on water skis).  The grand vistas of our America (including industrial might) are displayed in spectacular fashion with edifying narration.  Lots of fun stuff like that to show off the extra big, clear picture and a sound system of close to modern theatrical quality, at least to my ear. I was glad to have the experience, and am happy that this document exists.</p>
