<p>Quantico goes all Star Trek with the Kobayashi Maru exercise for the trainees. A test in crisis management as they work in pairs to take down a plane hijacker. A test the trainees find out which is uncrackable unless you are Captain Kirk and break in the night before and cheat the test.Alex has been directed by the voice to get to Senator Haas and plant something on her, even the high ranking FBI agent Hannah Wyland who has been very suspicious of Alex feels something is wrong and agrees to help out Alex. It really does seem that Alex somehow gets all the breaks.It is Ryan who has slowly getting suspicious of Alex and getting more concerned that she is up to something and pursuing her.The episode ends with some tension and clever twists which might make more than Senator Haas's temperature rise but parts of it dragged as the Kobayashi Maru bit dragged on for a bit.</p>
