<h1>Gilda Live (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A filmed version of the Broadway show starring comedienne Gilda Radner, complete with the characters she made famous on the TV show "Saturday Night Live."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Gilda Live" may be the best concert movie ever. It's got Gilda Radner performing some of her "SNL" skits on stage. Whether it's nerdy Lisa Loopner playing "The Way We Were", Emily ("Never mind!") Litella, or Roseanne ("It's always something!") Roseannadanna, she always has something. Don (Father Sarducci) Novello gives some of his usual commentary; notice the "coincidenza". It's really too bad that Gilda Radner died. She was really funny (her song at the beginning of this movie is truly something else).I never would have envisioned Mike Nichols directing a concert movie. Now that's always something!</p>
