<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's been a very long time since I've seen this film and I would love to revisit it. My uncle played "Garrity" and since he is now deceased, it would mean a lot to me to experience it again as well as possibly own a copy of it. Each time I hear "Unchained Melody" I think of uncle Johhny and his beautiful voice. For some reason I have been drawn to prison films ever since this one, and I consider this one of the best!</p>
