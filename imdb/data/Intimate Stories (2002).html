<h1>Intimate Stories (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Near the provincial town of San Julian, three vibrant characters undertake seemingly mundane journeys that turn out to be subtly life changing. A lonely, fastidious traveling salesman quests for the perfect cream cake to win the widow of his dreams. A grizzly grandfather hitchhikes to town to find his forgotten lost dog and seek forgiveness. A poor young mother hopes to win the grand prize--a microprocessor--as a contestant on a TV game show. In the end, the three will get more or less what they set out for, but it will come to them in ways that they never expected.</p>
<p>Three people and a baby set off on separate journeys, along the same road; their disparate dreams and stories intertwine amidst the breathtaking deserted Patagonic route.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many commentators before me use the word 'charming'. That's just it. A warm human film, rather focused on the people in it than on the story. I kept being reminded of Kaurismäki. Not only the slow pace, but the poverty, the loneliness, the stubbornness and the engaging warmth and love of the persons are similar. Each character has its 'style' or 'attribute'. Almost as in an 'étude de style', but still the film never ends up schematic. Roberto keeps perfectionizing everything and everyone. Don Justo insists on his independence while being pressed into the 'old-aged senile father-in-law' role, even really secondary personages as, for instance, the concurring player in the TV show or the woman giving the old man a ride, have their really own life. I have seen many films with amateur actors, I adore the way Sorin leads them, not making them play but letting them show us their lives.</p>
