<h1>Trog (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anthropologist Dr. Brockton (Joan Crawford) unearths a troglodyte (an Ice Age 'missing link" half-caveman, half-ape) and manages to domesticate him - until he's let loose by an irate land developer (Michael Gough) to go on a rampage and kidnap a little girl. Crawford's last feature film.</p>
<p>A sympathetic anthropologist uses drugs and surgery to try to communicate with a primitive troglodyte who is found living in a local cave.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>People sure do make a big deal out of Joan Crawford being drunk, especially in dreck like this.  I guess it would be surprising to learn that she was completely smashed during the filming of "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane," but let's forget that.  It was a decent movie.  My point here is that most of these reviews slam the star for being tipsy.  If you were making "Trog" you'd want to be as incoherent as possible!  Second, Joan doesn't mangle her lines.  They come out oddly, but they aren't mangled.  It wasn't like Joan Crawford to mess up, at least not in public.  The main problem with the lines is their utter idiocy.My first big problem with the movie wasn't the horrible sets.  It wasn't even Trog, who couldn't even get makeup from the waist down.  Brockton Research Centre is run by Dr. Brockton, who just happens to be Joan Crawford.   Here's my big problem.  Of all the actresses (drunken or not) in all the world, why in the heck would someone pick Joan Crawford to play an anthropologist?  Does she even know what one is?  Hearing her discuss Neanderthals makes me shudder.  I don't know anything about Neanderthals, and I don't think Joan can teach me a darn thing about them either.  "Conceivably, Trog was frozen solid" etc. etc. etc.  What?!?  I simply cannot believe Joan would waste her breath talking about cavemen.  It's wrong.  Even more incredible, she has earned a research center with her name all over it!  What did she do to get that?  Paint the sign herself?  I'm slamming Joan myself now, but still.  This is weird casting.As for the acting in the movie (this is a movie, not a film), Joan did better than the movie deserved.  That was something she had a gift for.  Giving more than she got.  She didn't get anything with this one, but she still gave it her all.  That causes people to snicker and laugh, saying "Joan must be stupid to think this movie merits all this."  No, the movie doesn't, but Joan's mind needed the knowledge that she always did (and looked her best).  We may laugh when she gets overly attached to what looks like a wrestler being attacked by a monkey, but we should give her some credit for trying.  That's why I think that one moment at the end of the film is quite good.  She refuses a newsman's microphone, and you can almost forget how awful this movie is when you see the weariness on her face.</p>
