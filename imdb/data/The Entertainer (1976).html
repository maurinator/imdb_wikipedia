<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The only thing I want to say about this superb piece of acting from the sorely missed "every man" Jack Lemmon is I would give my eye teeth for a copy of this on DVD. I saw this on TV in 1976 and have never forgotten this performance. It was absolutely and undeniably unforgettable! Olivier's is a fine piece of acting but the verve that Lemmon gave to the song and dance numbers somehow seemed just a little bit more desperate and that made them more convincing. This is not to say that Sir Laurence is not a grand thespian and it was not a great part for him...it was. I am merely saying,I prefer Lemmon in the part and would love to see it on DVD. It is hard to say if we will ever see it now that the shops are dying due to the idiotic notion that many people believe in illegal downloads(Coming from a show business home, I certainly do not!) and these kiosks that only seem to have the popular films(and nothing else)for one dollar a night. I am certainly going to miss foreign films and special interest films and deep catalog movies. Such is the Wal-Mart thinking of this peculiar economy and seemingly uneducated public. (I have to remember they actually like special effects in favor of a good story line). I guess I am not like most of the movie going public. I hate special effects movies. I prefer something with a story like "A Very Long Engagement".</p>
