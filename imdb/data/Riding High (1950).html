<h1>Riding High (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A horse trainer who has fallen on hard times looks to his horse, Broadway Bill, to finally win the big race.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A lovely remake of the director's own Broadway Bill, Riding High is full to the brim with comedy, action and romance. We don't get Myrna Loy this time (shame!), but Capra's handling is as adept as ever and he even allows Bing to sing a handful of trackside standards! Whilst the film cannot match the very best Capra/Riskin collaborations, it is nevertheless great fun, with Bing perfectly cast in the lead. My only complaint is in the over-abundance of stock footage from Broadway Bill (presumably due to financial constraints).Sheer escapism, with a decent moral and lovely performances all round. Leave your cynicism at the door and you should have a ball!</p>
