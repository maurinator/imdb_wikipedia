<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Boy, I have heard a lot of people knock this film and really slam it and I don't get it. Sure, it was dark, pitch dark, but it was funny. Lighten up people. The story picks up with Favreau about to be married to Cameron Diaz, not bad, Jon. Favreau's character seems quite nervous, we will later find out why that is. This is one of those classic abyss films, how much farther down can the lives of these guys go into the dark void. Each decision made leads them into more dire consequences. Christian Slater is at his comedic best, his character is sort of a cross between Charles Manson and Anthony Robbins. Stern has you convinced that he is about to have a stroke. Piven is also quite good. Everybody is good in this film. The film deals with the consequences of how people deal with a crisis. If one takes the moral way out, perhaps everything will be alright. However, if one takes another way to avoid possible punishment, what will be the long term outcome of that? In this film, you see through hindsight, what a tangled web we weave when we first practice to deceive. Great performances, great direction, great movie! **** out of ****!</p>
