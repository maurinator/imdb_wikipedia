<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perhaps this is the truest form of Marmite in film has yet offered humanity. It seems to have been well reviewed by some sources and I cannot argue with their conclusions. Yet for me, these seem entirely erroneous.The film, in my opinion, was too long, too contrived, too repetitive, too tedious, poorly directed and most of all I just found it sadly enormously dull. I could rant for some time, but I feel the best direction I can give to those who are reading this review is to tell of the reaction of my family and two friends (ages ranging from 16-59 years old) who one summer's evening drove out to an outdoor viewing of this film at which Tony Harrison was himself present.We look back on it now with some hilarity, but of those 7 viewers (myself included) I can personally guarantee readers that this film could not possibly have attained more than 20 stars (less than 3 on average per person). It was, for us, a horrible evening of subjection to the worst form of artistic expression. I would urge readers to stay away from this film, but they say seeing is believing, so go find out for yourself. In my case, I truly believe this ranks amongst the worst "films" I have ever seen.</p>
