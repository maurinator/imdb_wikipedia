<h1>The Captain's Paradise (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mediterranean ferryboat captain Henry St James has things well organized - a loving and very English wife Maud in Gibraltar, and the loving if rather more hot-blooded Mistress, Nita in Tangiers. A perfect life. As long as neither woman decides to follow him to the other port.</p>
<p>Henry St. James, captain of a large ferry that shuttles between the British colony in Gibraltar and the Spanish-ruled peninsula of Ceuta in northern Morocco, is a man who covertly maintains a wife at one port, and a mistress at another. For security reasons, access to Gibraltar is restricted and the only member of the Golden Fleece's crew eligible for shore leave is St. James, so the likelihood of St. James' women meeting is remote despite their relatively close proximity. Each woman represents a different aspect of womanhood that the captain finds attractive. Maud in Gibraltar is a dutiful wife and housekeeper, a good cook, and a faithful homebody, while Nita in Morocco is a voluptuously sexy siren who appeals to his more hedonistic nature which loves dancing and drinking until dawn. Trouble in Paradise begins when Maud begins to crave a more carefree existence and Nita longs to develop her domestic skills.</p>
<p>The bigamist captain of a ferry boat between the restricted British colony in Gibraltar and Spanish Morocco has a woman of differing appeal and temperament in each port.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ship's captain Alec Guinness seems to have a dull life, he's had the same job for years, taking his ship back and forth between Gibraltar and Morocco. Little does anyone know, that the Captain has worked out his idea of a paradise, he has a wife at either end of the line!  In British Gibraltar Cecia Johnson gives him all the comforts of domesticity and respectability, and in Morocco sexy Yvonne DeCarlo gives him... you know.  Of course, such a life is doomed to complications, and thereby hangs the plot of the  film.A subtly wicked comedy, a lesser "Kind Hearts and Coronets".Never really belly-laugh funny, but highly witty and great fun. And I love the ending, it's perfect.</p>
