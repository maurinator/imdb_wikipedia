<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Luscious Lana Turner stars as "Kit," a lovely yet jaded socialite with a few million in the bank, a private yacht, a house in every port, and a hunky husband played by Cliff Robertson. They are currently staying in Acapulco, where Lana is being pursued by a virile gigolo (O'Brian) much to her husband's jealousy. Tables turn when Lana notices her husband's affections are turning to a seemingly innocent young woman played by Stephanie Powers.The plot is mostly concerned with Lana and her jaded friends playing the field, drinking drinking drinking, changing outfits (Lana has several knockout pieces designed by Edith Head), and spouting cynical yet often profound dialogue. Contrary to what has been said, the film is remarkably subtle in its storytelling approach. The visuals are grand, the performances are sound, and the dialogue priceless.Lana's character, who by all outwards appearances seems a heartless vamp, actually has a deep core of vulnerability which is gradually exposed throughout the film. Her husband is sensitive but it takes him some time to see his wife for what she is inside -- and not the shallow playgirl she pretends to be. There is one fabulous line in which Lana explains to Stephanie Powers how she met her husband. It was in a hospital -- Lana was ill and wanted to 'buy his blood,' setting Lana up as the ultimate vampire.The climactic bull fight scene is vivid and highly dramatic. The colors and cinematography in many scenes, including this one, are inspired.This is one of Lana's most interesting, and solid, films. At 45, she never looked more beautiful.</p>
