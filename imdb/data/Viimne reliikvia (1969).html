<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A medieval love story with lots of adventures. The times are troubled - there's a revolt of peasants going on. To secure its safety a monastery chases for a relics of a holy Brigitte. A nobleman promises to get it if he gets beautiful Agnes as a reward. But she fells in love with a handsome adventurer. The monastery has to act shrewd now and play double game. The movie is still the best achievement of the Estonian cinema. Based on a novel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'Prince Gabriel or the Last Days of Pirita Convent' is a book Estonian children read in school. It is a classic, yet not a very good book in my opinion. Yet the movie based on it is superb. Everything about it is great: the story, the acting, the scenery (really, you should watch it simply because it's so beautiful), the dialogues etc. It is a movie that Estonians won't stop remembering or quoting. This is irrelevant, yet, in my opinion, it is sad that Ivo Schenkenberg is known as a 'bad guy' and villain, while in reality he was quite an interesting historical figure, called 'the Hannibal of Estonia', who fought in the Livonian war at the end of the 15th century. I say it again: the movie is wonderful and you won't regret it if you watch it.</p>
