<h1>Younger and Younger (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jonathan Younger, a slick, cool and flashy owner of a self-storage business loves two things the most. His job - and female customers. His hardworking common-looking wife and business partner Penny does not approve of this at all and even fantasizes about killing him. One day, after flirting with a pretty customer, Jonathan hits a huge Wurlitzer organ (musical instrument) which releases a thundering sound that terrifies unsuspecting Penny and she instantly dies from a heart attack. Jonathan and his son Winston must now run their business together. Winston wants things to work, but series of quirky and annoying customers brings him to the edge of sanity. Meanwhile, Jonathan starts seeing Penny's ghost, but the more he sees her, the hotter and younger she looks. She is also as flirtatious as ever, so he falls in love with her all over again. Will Winston manage to save their business or will he completely lose it? Is Jonathan really seeing Penny or is he losing his mind completely?</p>
<p>A strange man owns a self-storage facility and lives in a reality of his own, until reality comes crashing down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Found this sleeper on the video shelf a couple of years ago and loved it. Saw it again recently and still enjoyed it. An eccentric film, not for your average vegetable brained young movie viewer. There is no action, no sex (well, not really), just an absorbing story that rolls out in a leisurely fashion, gradually pulling the viewer into this unique locale. Sutherland, Davidovitch and even Kellerman are wonderful. Sutherland must have been delighted to find this role and he made the most of it. Again, not for everyone, but an intriguing trip into a world most of us will never know, but might like to.</p>
