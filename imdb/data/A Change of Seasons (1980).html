<h1>A Change of Seasons (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A self-centred university lecturer thinks it quite all right that he has taken one of his students as a lover, but is deeply hurt when his wife retaliates by taking a similar approach with a visiting carpenter. His announcement that he is off to the family holiday home for some skiing with his paramour is met by his wife insisting she and her young joiner go too, and the four set off for an awkward time in the snow.</p>
<p>Marriage takes a sour turn when a middle-aged husband falls for a young and sexy woman. Things get even more complicated when his wife starts a hot affair with a young lover of her own.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anthony Hopkins plays a University professor engaged in an affair with a young student(Bo Derek, the perfectly cast "10"). His wife(played by Shirley MacLaine)finds out about it, but rather than divorce him, instead has an affair of her own with a young carpenter who just so happens to be doing work in their home. Hopkins is none to pleased by this, yet the four of them nonetheless go on a skiing trip together at their vacation cabin, where relationships will come to a head, since their college age daughter also arrives with her boyfriend...Good actors cannot do much with such mundane material. Its attempts to be "modern" about the morality of affairs is awkward and unconvincing, and the film is mostly dreary and unsatisfying, though Bo Derek lights up every scene she is in(especially in the hot tub!)</p>
