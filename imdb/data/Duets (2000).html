<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We loved the movie. It was very funny, poignant, sweet and the cast of characters was perfect. Gwyneth was fantastic and she sings great. I wasn't sure it was her, but today I read that she did it all. It was great see Huey Lewis, missed him for a long time. The other characters were also very funny and the music was super. We are going out to by the soundtrack after the weekend. Hooray for a great night of fun. That is what movies are for.Maria Bello and Andre Braugner were just perfect fits for their parts.</p>
