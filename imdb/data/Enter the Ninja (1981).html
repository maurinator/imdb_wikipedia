<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As B-movies go, this movie is hilarious and absolutely entertaining. The renegade macho posturing, over-the-top costuming and sound effects, and the genuinely comic manners of death can easily coalesce to something transcendent for you; if you're worried that a camp film will leave you feeling that you've merely wasted your time, worry not. This film is much funnier than anything you've seen on MST3K, and would be delightful even without irony for anyone who likes to watch lost paint-ballers, Chuck Norris movies and/or right-wing survivalist nut-jobs. After this movie, I like to slap on some "Brut" cologne, do squats and hold my breath until laughter prompts release.</p>
