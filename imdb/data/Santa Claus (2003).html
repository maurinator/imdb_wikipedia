<h1>Santa Claus (2003)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i saw this movie at a film festival and i have to say it is one of the most brilliant short films i've ever seen. the humor is very sophisticated rivaling that of the great marx brothers. the movie is shot in a minimalist style that greatly enhances the transending imagery. i love it the way a french man loves andy kaufman.</p>
