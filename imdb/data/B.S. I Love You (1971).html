<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It has been a long time since I have seen this and can't remember much of it. However, I just wanted to respond to the other person that posted thinking it wasn't much of a satire of advertising. To today's audience it may not seem so, but at the time I think it was considered pretty cutting within the industry as the people portrayed were recognizable parodies of well-known people in the field. For example the character played by Joanna Barnes would seem to me to absolutely be based on Mary Wells Lawrence (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wells_Lawrence).It definitely was not the first film to satire advertising and others may have been earlier and better (Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?) but at the time, it was exploring a theme that might still be considered if not cutting edge, not yet done to death.</p>
