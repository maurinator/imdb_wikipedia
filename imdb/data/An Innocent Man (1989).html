<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jimmie Rainwood was minding his own business when two corrupt police officers (getting an address wrong) burst into his house, expecting to find a major drug dealer. Rainwood is shot, and the officers frame him as a drug dealer. Rainwood is convicted of drug dealing, based on the perjured evidence of a police informant. Thrown into a seedy jail, fighting to prove his innocence is diffucult when he has to deal with the realities of prison life, where everyone claims they were framed.</p>
<p>Jimmie Rainwood is an ordinary man whose life is turned upside down when two (corrupt) cops, who took down the wrong address, bursts into his house, thinking that there would be drugs. To cover themselves up, they place a gun in Rainwood's hand and drugs all over his house. The fact that it's his word against two cops and that also the prosecution used some small indiscretions from his past to make him look bad, Rainwood is found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. Rainwood tries to make the best of it, but when one of the cons sets his sights on Rainwood, Rainwood is told by one of con's rivals that he has to take out the con before he does anything serious to Rainwood. After being beaten up and witnessing just how sadistic the con is, Rainwood takes him out with help from Virgil, a con who's in prison because of the two cops who framed Rainwood. Rainwood's paroled after three years, and tries to get on with his life but the two cops who framed, are worried that Rainwood might come after them so they warn Rainwood not to do anything. And that inspires him to go after them with Virgil's help.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a great example of a character thrust into an awful situation - a situation where you question, "What would I do in his shoes?" For that reason, it is very tense and suspenseful throughout as Tom Selleck's character tries to navigate prison life. I really felt for his character - his acting was great. Sure, there are some moments of cheesy lines and overdone composing and a bit of over-acting by the various villains, but for the most part, this is one of the better character thrillers I've seen in awhile. Selleck is great, as if the man who befriends him inside the prison. Can't find anything new to watch? I recommend checking out this little gem from 1989!</p>
