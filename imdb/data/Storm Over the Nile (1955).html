<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sweeping new adaptation plenty of idealism ,heroism, friendship, redemption and overwhelming battles. It's a great classical British imperialism adventure , a genuine ripping yarn picking up several images and with some stirring action of the quite better 1939 version . This fifth rendition about known story by A.E.W. Mason concerns on a British young officer named Harry Faversham (Anthony Steel). Resigning from Army , he's rejected by his father-in-law (James Robertson Justice) and his engaged fiancée (Mary Ure), branded a coward and sent four white feathers by his friends( Ronald Lewis, Laurence Harvey, Ian Carmichael) . Determined to save his honor he heads to Sudan campaign against Derviches who previously (thirteen years before) had murdered General Gordon in Karthoum. There arrives the expedition of help commanded by General Wolsey and Kitchener for stifle the rebellious Sudan's tribes ruled by 'the Madhdi', the ¨expected one¨(events developed in ¨Khartoum¨film-1966- with Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier, directed by Basil Dearden).The Madhi along with Arab tribes had besieged Khartoum(1884) and vanquished General Gordon . Faversham disguised himself as native will save his friends from certain death and he will retrieve the lost honors.This spectacular adventure detailing the epic feats of a brave hero, contains noisy action,idealism, romance, unlimited courage, breathtaking battles and impressive landscapes. It's a typically polished British and packs enthusiasm of imperialist arrogance with standard issue heroics. Anthony Steel as stubborn officer is fine , Laurence Harvey as his best friend is convincingly played and Mary Ure as his girlfriend is enjoyable. Special mention to James Roberson Justice as swagger general Burroughs . Solid performances all around and excellent plethora of secondaries as Christopher Lee, Ferdy Mayne, Michael Hordern, Geoffrey keen among them. Sensational battle scenes staged by thousands extras though partially taken from former film. Evocative cinematography with superb Technicolor camera-work reflecting the late 1800's and spectacular African landscapes by cameraman Edward Scaife and Osmond Borradaille for exterior photography in Sudan and interiors filmed in Shepperton studios. Rousing and impressive musical score by Benjamin Frankel. The motion picture is professionally directed by Zoltan Korda and Terence Young with imagination and fair-play . Other adaptations about this famous story are : the ancient and silent take on filmed in 1915, 1921, and 1929 directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper with Richard Arlen, Fay Wray and Clive Brook ; the classic rendition by Zoltan Korda(1939) with John Clemens, Ralph Richardson and Jane Duprez ; and for TV(1978)with Beau Bridges, Jane Seymour and modern rendition with Heath Ledger , Kate Hudson and Wes Bentley</p>
