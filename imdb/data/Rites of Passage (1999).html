<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a very good film.  The characters are very well developed and you also feel a certain emotion for each one.  My particular favorite was the lead character, Campbell Faraday (Jason Behr).  This film holds a lot of tension and there are quite a bit of twists also.If you are in the mood for a good thrill ride, go rent this movie.**** out of **** stars.Also recommended: The River Wild</p>
