<h1>Themroc (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Made without proper language, just gibberish and grunts, this is an absurdist comedy about a man who rejects every facet of normal bourgeois life and turns his apartment into a virtual cave.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A great film. Woefully cheap. Blissfully purposeful. Knows exactly what it thinks and says it with brutal clarity and biting humour, all shot in a ragged verit√© style that seems strangely contemporary. A factory worker goes off his trolley, throws society's rulebook out of the window and reverts to being a caveman. And that's about it - talk about a high concept! There's no dialogue, only gibberish and grunts, but, incredibly, it works. It's easy not to like this film, but hard not to be impressed by it. Check it out for yourself and see.</p>
