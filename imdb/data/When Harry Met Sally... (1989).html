<h1>When Harry Met Sally... (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry and Sally meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. The film jumps through their lives as they both search for love, but fail, bumping into each other time and time again. Finally a close friendship blooms between them, and they both like having a friend of the opposite sex. But then they are confronted with the problem: "Can a man and a woman be friends, without sex getting in the way?"</p>
<p>Harry and Sally first meet as they finish college in Chicago and spend 18 hours together in a car headed to New York. They don't quite hit off, particularly after Harry opines that a man and a woman can never be just friends because he'll always want to have sex with her. Over the next 10 years, they occasionally meet and soon do in fact become fast friends. They share the intimate details of their lives - hopes, dreams, failures and successes - and in the process also fall in love. It's not evident that will be able to sustain their relationship once they sleep together however.</p>
<p>Harry and Sally have known each other for years, and are very good friends, but they fear sex would ruin the friendship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is not just your average chick flick tearjerker romance movie. I'm sure that a lot of guys can relate to this movie as well. First of all, there are some hilarious lines in this movie that will appeal to men and women. Second, the orgasm scene in the restaurant has got to be one of the funniest scenes in movie history. And finally, the guys will be cheering on Billy Crystal, as he makes love to a LOT of women in this movie. I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm pretty sure that I am a guy (I'll check later). Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan will remind everyone of their everyday lives in this true-to-life (and very funny) movie. So guys, don't reject "When Harry Met Sally..." just because women cried at it. And girls, if you see this movie, you will probably want to see it another 50 times.</p>
