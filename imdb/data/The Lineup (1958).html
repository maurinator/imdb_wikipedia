<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good crime drama with interesting settings and some good action scenes.The movie really showcases San Francisco. Sutro Baths  ( now sadly lost in a fire) is the setting for a some excellent scenes. You will also see the Opera House, the Ferry Building, some freeways being built, and other interesting sights. If you want to see how San Francisco looked in 1958 and see some pretty good action and some pretty mean bad guys you will enjoy this one.</p>
