<h1>Glory (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gordon McLeod is the manager of a second tier Scottish football team. Faced with pressure from his American owner, he is forced to bring on a marquee player to improve the fortunes of the team and prevents its being moved from the fiercely loyal town it's been for a century. Along the way, McLeod must battle his own demons, including long-standing tiffs with both his daughter and a former colleague who betrayed him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I personally thought that A Shot At Glory was a brilliant film portraying an underdog football team doing so well. A scenario that often happens in the stages of the Scottish Cup and the CIS Insurance Cup. I never thought this film would ever be released after waiting two years since i had sat in the stands of Hampden Park for the filming of the final(being a Rangers supporter I naturally sat in the Rangers end). As well as a great plot and characterisation the visual effects were also brilliant, making a Hampden park with little over 1,000 supporters in it looking as if it was at a 50,000 capacity. Well a brilliant film in my eyes and i had slight smile on my face when the words "thanks to all the supporters who screamed their hearts out" appeared on the screen at the cinema. A definite 10 out of 10.</p>
