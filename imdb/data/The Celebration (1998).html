<h1>The Celebration (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Father turns 60. His family, which is a big one of the kind, gathers to celebrate him on a castle. Everybody likes and respects the father deeply...or do they? The youngest son is trying to live up to the father's expectations. He is running a grill-bar in a dirty part of Copenhagen. The oldest son runs a restaurant in France, while the sister is a anthropologist. The older sister has recently committed suicide and the father asks the oldest son to say a few words about her, because he is afraid he will break into tears if he does it himself. The oldest son agrees without argument. Actually he has already written two speeches. A yellow and a green one. By the table, he asks the father to pick a speech. The father chooses green. The oldest son announces that this is the Speech of Truth. Everybody laughs, except for the father who gets a nervous look on his face. For he knows that the oldest son is about to reveal the secret of why the oldest sister killed herself.</p>
<p>A darkly comic journey into forbidden family territory. No one can ignore a person like Danish patriarch Helge Klingenfeldt. So on his sixtieth birthday, a celebration is required.

And since his twin sister's death two months ago, prodigal son Christian is more haunted than usual.

The celebration becomes a weekend that none will ever forget.</p>
<p>At Helge's 60th birthday party, some unpleasant family truths are revealed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vinterberg's "Festen" which follows the strict guidelines of Dogma 95 could perhaps be hampered in its artistic approach, but not so here.  Indeed with the hand-held camera the reality of the scene is intensified to such an extent one feels an integral part of the drama.It's a family celebration of father Helge's 60th birthday.  It's strange though that all the guests seem to arrive at the same time, speeding up the driveway in great excitement. There is lots of noise. hugs and kisses and the camera intruding in a mischievous way.This family has some terrible dark secrets known to some, not to all.  They are divulged by the eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomson) in his dinner speech toasting his father. This is a wonderful scene, tense, sharp, riveting.  The guests are shaken to the core.  Is he telling the truth or is he having a wicked game with the assembled company? It's great stuff - really compelling drama.The history of the family can be pieced together from information revealed in a series of toasts, but Christian's contribution renders the party speechless.  It's a fairly noisy film with lots of people talking together, having arguments (Christian's brother Michael {Thomas Bo}     has an uncontrollable temper) or screaming in frustration.  These out bursts contrast so well with the scenes of stunned silence.  They are quite electrifying moments - no words are necessary.Films like this one make movie-watching well worthwhile.  No wonder it won a Jury Prize.</p>
