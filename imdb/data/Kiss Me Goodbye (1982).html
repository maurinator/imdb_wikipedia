<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very sweet story about a love triangle between a woman, her boyfriend, and the ghost of her dead husband.  The subtext about getting on with your life after suffering a tragedy seemed heartfelt rather than manufactured; and Sally Field was, well, the incredible actress that she's always been.</p>
