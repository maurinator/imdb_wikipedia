<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film of 1968 starring a stylishly young Dev Anand and a beautiful Vaijayanti mala is a treat to old film buffs..It has a strong story , melodious songs ( dooriyan nazdeekiya by Lata and Kishore stands out) and a dramatic courtroom trial, pitting the formidable Balraj sahni and energetic Dev anand as prosecutor and defense lawyer respectively about a murder which keeps you guessing about the identity of the killer till the last scene..His motive is also established and so this is a real 'feel good' thriller..No fancy special effects, no Glitz or vulgarity..A bit slow in the first half till it gets to the crime drama part..but its forgivable as you keep watching two good looking stars most of the time, anyway..Go watch it...</p>
