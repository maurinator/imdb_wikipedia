<h2> Summaries </h2>

But the devil Barney makes him an offer: if he manages to get three innocent youths to sell him their souls in the next two months, he may stay on earth. Max accepts, and returns to earth, equipped with special powers. However his task is harder than expected, especially when 7 years old Tobi demands that he marry his mother.</p>
<p>When a frequent sinner named Max Devlin dies, he goes to hell, as all bad souls do. But this time, there is a special exception-Barney, the devil's right-hand man, makes Max a deal. If he can trick three good, innocent people out of their souls in two months, he can return to Earth. Max goes off with special powers to make his "clients'" dreams come true. Max manages to get all three suckers to sign contracts giving up their souls, but being around so many good people changes his ways. When he learns that Barney lied and intends to harvest all four souls for himself, Max risks eternal damnation and burns the contracts, freeing his charges. But all works out well in the end, and Max returns to earth a better man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Elliott Gould dies in an accident and goes straight to hell to meet the devil himself (Bill Cosby), but that is not the end. Gould makes a deal to get out of hell by going back to Earth to get the souls of three young people in this would-be-comedy that is just not funny. Cosby is not on screen enough to even make a lasting impression and it is up to Gould and some sub-par young actors to carry the project. Gould does do his best, but all in all the film is just a project that wants to entertain and provide messages to its audience and failed to do either of those things. An odd production from the Disney studios. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
