<h1>One Magic Christmas (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gideon, a Christmas angel, is sent, by Santa, to help Ginny Grainger. Ginny is a cynic, and she hates Christmas. She and her family (husband, Jack and two kids, Cal and Abbie) have fallen on hard times, making it even harder to believe in anything that can't be seen. With help from Abbie, and a trip to see Santa Claus himself, can Gideon find a way to make Ginny believe again?</p>
<p>An angel must show a mother the true meaning of Christmas. It's not just presents and materialistic things, but the people she cares about.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've been watching this movie every Christmas since it first appeared on CBC in the '80s, and I have to say, I spend most of the movie misty-eyed. In this familiar story of a woman who has lost the Christmas spirit and rediscovers it through being shown how fortunate she is, there are several excellent performancesand a strong feeling of magic throughout.Mary Steenburgen, who plays Ginnie Grainger, the woman who has lost theChristmas spirit, undergoes an amazing transformation and some of the mostheart-wrenching moments I've seen on film. Harry Dean Stanton, as the angelGideon, plays his part with sensitivity, and Gary Basaraba is excellent as Jack, Ginnie's husband. Abbie, the six-year old daughter of the main character, steals the show, however. She never seems to be acting, and carries the innocence of childhood and the magic of Christmas with her. Keep an eye out for a veryyoung Sarah Polley as Molly Monaghan, and veteran Canadian actor JanRubes as the best Santa Claus on film to date, if only for his amazing costume.Keep a box of tissues on hand when you watch this movie! It demonstrates that a movie can be magical without overwhelming special effects, and that aChristmas movie can be sentimental without being schmaltzy.</p>
