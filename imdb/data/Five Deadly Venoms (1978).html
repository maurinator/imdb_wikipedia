<h1>Five Deadly Venoms (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A dying teacher instructs his final student to check on the activities of five former pupils, each of whom he taught a unique and special style of kung-fu to: The Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, and Toad (hence the title). His final student, who knows a little of each style must team up with one of the other good students to destroy the evil ones if there are any. Greed and treachery ensue as the student discovers that some of the students are indeed evil. But which one can he trust enough to team up with?</p>
<p>A kung-fu student is instructed by his dying teacher to track down five of the teacher's ex-students. Each of the five is equipped with a lethal martial arts skill, and the teacher fears this might be used for evil purposes. To make things more difficult for the student, not only does the teacher not know the identity of the students (who all wore masks under his training), but some of the students also don't know each other!</p>
<p>Chang Cheh's super-heroic, grand guignol-flavored thriller proved hugely popular in America, inspiring a U.S. soft drink commercial, and even an entire rap music act's world tour. It also spawned a film series featuring more amazing, high-flying blade-juggling, flesh-stabbing mayhem.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Seldom do I ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that I must speak about it immediately.  This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic.  I happened to see the dubbed version but I'm on my way right now to grab the DVD remaster with original Chinese dialogue.  Still, the dubbing didn't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour: "Poison Clan rocks the world!!!"The story-telling stays true to Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense, and inter-personal relationships.  You can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace. The martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed.  It's like watching real animals fight each other, but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms.  Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.The combination provides for a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution. ...Of course, if you just want to see people pummel each other, along with crude forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!</p>
