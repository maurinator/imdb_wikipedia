<h1>Murder in Three Acts (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hercule Poirot's assistant, Hastings, calls him down to Acapulco in Mexico where he can write his memoirs but Hastings drags him to a party populated with Hastings' new friends. There's Janet Crisp - the writer, Daisy Eastman and her daughter 'Egg', Ricardo Montoya, Dr. Strange, Miss Milray the housekeeper and Charles Cartwright the famous American actor. But at the party another guest - Rev. Babbington - dies from poisoning and when Dr. Strange also dies from poisoning, Poirot must swing into action before the serial killer strikes again...</p>
<p>Hercule Poirot attends a dinner party in which one of the guests clutches his throat and suddenly dies. The cause seems to be natural until another party with most of the same guests produces another corpse.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Murder in Three Acts" starts off rather poorly: the updating of the action to the 80's takes some getting used to, Hastings is portrayed as too much of a buffoon, and even Peter Ustinov himself seems to be hamming it up a bit too much in his first scenes. However, he gets more serious later on, and his climactic verbal reconstruction of the crimes is as delightful as ever - I just love the way he emphasizes certain words. The plot itself is quite clever - it begins with an apparently motiveless murder that turns out to be part of a grander scheme. For a TV movie, "Murder in Three Acts" has rather high production values: the Acapulco locations are beautiful, the houses and the hotels are lavish. But the cast cannot compare with those of Ustinov's theatrical Poirot outings, and most of the characters are very poorly defined. Still, if you are a mystery fan, this one is just about worth having in your collection. (**1/2)</p>
