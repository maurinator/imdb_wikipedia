<h1>The Loved One (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Newly arrived in Hollywood from England, Dennis Barlow finds he has to arrange his uncle's interment at the highly-organised and very profitable Whispering Glades funeral parlour. His fancy is caught by one of their cosmeticians, Aimee Thanatogenos. But he has three problems - the strict rules of owner Blessed Reverand Glenworthy, the rivalry of embalmer Mr Joyboy, and the shame of now working himself at The Happy Hunting Ground pets' memorial home.</p>
<p>Whispering Glades is a funeral home in Los Angeles. The staff there take their role in life - and death - very seriously, wanting to make the funeral process as beautiful and meaningful as possible. This at least is the outward perception of the organization, and the life goal of Whispering Glades make-up artist, Aimee Thanatogenous, whose professional goal is to become the first female embalmer. In her mind, beauty trumps all else. She catches the eye of Dennis Barlow, recently arrived in Los Angeles from Britain, and who is at Whispering Glades to arrange the funeral of his uncle, Sir Francis Hinsley. Dennis does whatever he feels he needs to to gain the favor of Aimee. Standing in his way is his work at Happy Hunting Grounds, a pet funeral home that steals Whispering Glades philosophy, his job there about which he doesn't tell her, and the attention she receives from the embalmer at Whispering Glades, Dr. Joyboy. But Whispering Glades may not be all that Aimee thinks it is, which could affect her relationship with Dennis and her view on life and death.</p>
<p>Satire on the funeral business, in which a young British poet goes to work at a Hollywood cemetery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having seen a Playboy magazine article on the making of the film, this 15 year-old had to see it to believe it.  This was in Boston, and the theater chain (Sack) had lopped off considerable footage, but I never knew of this until a PBS showing of it years later revealed a scene with the astronaut's wife that, after having seen the movie so many times that I could recite it, caught me completely by surprise.  I skipped school and sat for an entire day in the glory of this perverted beauty.  I received a book on the making of the Loved One, and discovered that there was a whole batch of stars, such as Ruth Gordon, who never made it to the final cut.  But with or without, this one packs one hell of a punch - a scathing indictment of the '60s and all that it beheld, from a Jackie Kennedy look-alike in the opening scenes to that wonderful orgy in the casket filled chamber.  Look close for a quick Jami Farr changing a portrait of The Queen at the luncheon held at the Brit exile's club.  This is my all-time favorite movie, bar none.</p>
