<h1>The War of the Worlds (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>H.G. Well's classic novel is brought to life in this tale of alien invasion. The residents of a small town in California are excited when a flaming meteor lands in the hills. Their joy is tempered somewhat when they discover that it has passengers who are not very friendly. The movie itself is understood better when you consider that it was made at the height of the Cold War--just replace Martian with Russian....</p>
<p>The Martians unchain a direct assault to our planet, with hundreds of invulnerable ships. The invasion takes place all over the world, and all the major cities are destroyed one after one--even the atomic bomb can't stop them. But if the humans can't beat them, who can? Maybe something MUCH smaller....</p>
<p>Producer George Pal's and director Byron Haskin's landmark adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells novel that focuses on the invasion of the Earth by Martian war machines.</p>
<p>It's the 20th Century and, to the unsuspecting human population, Martians are appearing on Earth with destruction on their mind. While everyone panics, Dr. Clayton Forrester and Sylvia Van Buren join together in hiding out away from all the mayhem.</p>
<p>A small town in California is attacked by Martians.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>HG Wells' futuristic novel responds well to the Technicolor splashed on it in this 50s B classic.  Gene Barry over emotes in the lead now and then but the martian invasion is handled very well and the tension rises to the final scenes where the surviving populace huddle in the church as the buildings crash and burn around them.'War of the Worlds' deserves its place as both a highly regarded novel and a well-remembered movie.  Byron Haskin and George Pal did a great job in visualising the apocalyptic bits of Wells' text, while still making the end result enjoyable and interesting for the viewer.Recommended for fans of intellectualised science fiction.</p>
