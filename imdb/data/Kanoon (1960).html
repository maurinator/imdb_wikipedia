<p>A young lawyer accidently witnesses his prospective father-in-law, a respected judge, murdering a moneylender. A burglar who stumbles across the body is then arrested for the murder and is put on trial before the judge's court, leaving the lawyer with a moral dilemma.</p>
<p>Kalidas is a killer arrested by the police for murder. He is up for trial in the Court of Judge Badri Prasad, and he pleads guilty. He also informs the Court that he has already been convicted of the same crime 10 years ago when the Courts sentenced him for killing the very same man who has died at his hands recently. The Court is shocked at this erroneous decision, which may well have led Kalidas to the gallows for a crime he did not commit. Justices Badri Prasad and Jha continue this discussion after the proceedings are over and both take a bet that one of them could get away with murder. Shortly thereafter, a money-lender named Dhaniram is killed. A man, Kaalia, is arrested by the police, is in custody and is accused of killing Dhaniram. But Kaalia claims that he only went to rob Dhaniram's house, and did not kill him. Advocate Kailash Khanna comes to the defense of Kalidas and enters a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Kailash is the prospective son--in-law of Judge Prasad as he is in love with his daughter, Meena. Throughout the proceedings, Kailash closely watches Judge Prasad as the Public Prosecutor goes on lay evidence upon evidence to prove that it was Kaalia who killed Dhaniram. Then when Khanna's turn comes, he points his finger accusingly at Prasad and accuses him of killing Dhaniram. There is furore in the Courtroom and subsequently in the media, as Prasad steps down and lets Jha take over the proceedings. Then there is a sudden turn of events when suddenly Kaalia informs the Court that it was he, and he alone that killed Dhaniram. It is now up to Khanna to decide to wean the truth out of this matter, or just accept the turn of events and carry on with this life.</p>
<p>All law is based on human evidence, and since human beings are what they are, their evidence cannot be infallible. Is it therefore justifiable to take the life of one man on the evidence of another? Judge Badri Prasad (Ashok Kumar) has a son, Vijay, and a daughter, Meena, who is engaged to a Public Prosecutor, Kailash Khanna (Rajendra Kumar). Being extravagant, Vijay gets into debt with Dhaniram, a vicious moneylender. Unable to tell his father, he goes to Meena and asks her to send Kailash to plead with Dhaniram, which she does. However, as Kailash arrives at the moneylender's house, he spots the Judge approaching; this being a delicate matter, he hides himself. But to his horror, he witnesses the Judge murdering Dhaniram - and to make matters worse, a petty thief who just happens to be around is arrested for the crime! Kailash, dumbfounded to see that the thief's trial takes place in Judge Prasad's court itself, decided to defend the innocent man. But now he is faced with the dilemma of trying to save the innocent thief's life; but at the same time knowing who the real murderer is, but being unable to expose him.</p>
<p>A lawyer holds the eyewitness evidence to catch a killer, but the identified criminal is the lawyer's own mentor, prospective father-in-law, and also the judge who presides over the case.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Capital Punishment has a marked prominence in the annals of all recorded history. There has been no civilization where this form of punishment has not been practiced. Be it the Greeks, or the Romans, or the Chinese- all had strict stipulations on human execution as a part of their code of law. Even major religions like Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism have permitted capital punishment for certain offenses. But despite all this, there has always been a serious debate on whether human execution is justified. It has always been argued whether justice is always just; most certainly there have been many recorded instances where apparently innocent have been executed. BR Chopra's 1960 movie Kanoon essentially debates and discusses this very pertinent issue of whether a human has got the right to take the life of another human, even if it is a means of enforcing punishment. Starring Ashok Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, and Nanda in principal roles along with some splendid lesser known actors essaying crucial roles, Kanoon is a resounding statement on the fallacies of human court of justice and on the inadequacies of the written law.Kanoon is completely a director's film. It is an explosive subject and each and every scene shows the kind of efforts that would have gone in writing it. The dialogues are emphatic, the silences even more so. Most of the movies have one or two memorable scenes, but this one boasts of a series of such spectacular scenes that create a tremendous impact- right from the first scene, to the culmination of the drama. If one has to choose the most dramatic scenes, surprisingly a lot of them also come outside the court of law- behind the scenes of all the true drama. My vote would go to the interactions between the father and son in law post the murder, when Badri Prasad finds Kailash peeping into his private diary. Also the dialogue between the accused thief and his defendant Kailash is remarkably handled. There is also a superbly done slight side track when Meena starts suspecting Kailash of the murder, having absolutely just reasons for doing so. This delicate interplay of emotions between the protagonists is a delight to watch. The highpoint, though, as expected is the jaw-dropping climax, complete with the tense buildup and replete with an efficient disrobing of facts post the suspense is revealed.The actors do more than a fine job, and show great dexterity despite the help they receive from the remarkable written material. I haven't seen much of Rajendra Kumar, but still can safely assume that this would be one of his best performances (most of the others I believe are in the sappy romantic space where he excelled and thus got knighted as the Jubilee Kumar). Ashok Kumar is truly amazing in his highly sinuous role. His effortless ease is hard to miss. Meena is slightly more than a typical Hindi movie heroine and gets good scope to leave a mark. There are no songs in the narrative, though it does boast of a finely choreographed ballet dance performance that blends seamlessly with the story.Parting Note: Kanoon is simply a MUST WATCH for the people who love their court-room dramas, and also for those who like watching thrillers (though this is not a thriller in the conventional sense). What elevates it from being just an excellent film is its thought, and its purpose which it conveys in the most effective manner possible- through the route of a highly entertaining story. moviesandnomore.blogspot.in</p>
