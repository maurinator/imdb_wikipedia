<h1>The Assassination Bureau (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Assassination Bureau has existed for decades (perhaps centuries) until Diana Rigg begins to investigate it. The high moral standing of the Bureau (only killing those who deserve it) is called into question by her. She puts out a contract for the Bureau to assassinate its leader on the eve of World War I.</p>
<p>For her first assignment a lady journalist tracks down the head of an organisation offering to kill, for money, people deserving of such a fate. She thinks herself very clever when he agrees to take a contract with himself as the target. What she doesn't know is that her paper's owner is second-in-command in the Bureau and has his own reasons for supporting her challenge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After reading the other comments here, I wonder if these folks saw the same movie.  This film is a lot of fun, a touch on the slap-stick side and it isn't supposed to be Bond OR the Pink Panther.  Maybe the problem is generational???  Those of us who grew up in the far away and ancient times learned that there didn't have to be an action sequence every thirty seconds, lots of overt sex and toilet humor.  These things are what seem to "make" a movie today and it's why a lot of people of my generation a) don't go to a lot of films today and b) really worry about the ones who think the named qualities are what make a movie "good".  Oh, well.  Every generation has to grow up.  When they do, maybe they will find that The Assassination Bureau really is the laugh riot while The American Pies and What About Marys are noted to be rather--well--gross.</p>
