<h1>Private Parts (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Having always wanted to be a disc-jockey, Howard Stern works his way painfully from radio at his 1970's college to a Detroit station. It is with a move to Washington that he hits on an outrageous off-the-wall style that catches audience attention. Despite his on-air blue talk, at home he is a loving husband. He needs all the support he can get when he joins NBC in New York and comes up against a very different vision of radio.</p>
<p>The autobiographical story of Howard Stern, the radio rebel who is now also a TV personality, an author and a movie star.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is for everyone including those who "think" that they don't like Howard.  It shows Howard as a regular guy who can do some outrageous bits. Some bits you like, some you don't.  The two thoughts that I was left with leaving the theatre is 1) he is devoted to his wife and family, 2) he is a success story despite so very many obstacles.  Love him or hate, all but the most prudish will enjoy this.</p>
