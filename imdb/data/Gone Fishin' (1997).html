<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two working-class buddies, Joe and Gus, win a contest and get a free fishing trip. When they arrive, everything goes wrong - hurricanes, stolen car, blow-ups and other catastrophes follow them.</p>
<p>Joe and Gus are established early on as two of life's losers. As children, they are shown in opening sequences blowing up an industry as they toss a cigarette in an open pipe. Years later, as adults they get to go on a fishing vacation that you know has to go wrong. First, they are conned out of their car keys by a con man killer, who preys on older women. As they give pursuit, they team up with two young women who are also after the killer who took all of Arquette's mother's jewelry and money. Many disasters later, the two are faced with the killer and all of his loot. Willie Nelson makes a brief appearance as a philosopher fisherman that the two amateur fishermen worship.</p>
<p>Two fishing fanatics get in trouble when their fishing boat gets stolen while on a trip.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this is one of those innocent films you just love, the critics were a little harsh on the rating, i remember seeing this when i was 9, i absolutely loved it, lots of action and fishing! which is what really interested me, although there are a lot of goofs i still enjoy this one from time to time and brings back those good childhood memories!. it is sad though that one of the stunt men died though, the movie is pretty interesting as the main actors are well known and are absolutely hilarious, the first time i saw this movie i laughed so hard i choked, Danny gloves and Joe pesci really make great actors together as there funny antics will keep you entertained! just don't miss out and watch this great old movie</p>
