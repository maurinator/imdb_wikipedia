<h1>Travels with My Aunt (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At his mother's funeral, stuffy bank clerk Henry Pulling meets his Aunt Augusta, an elderly eccentric with more-than-shady dealings who pulls him along on a whirlwind adventure as she attempts to rescue an old lover.</p>
<p>At the funeral of Angelica Pulling in London, her staid, straight-laced and joyless banker son, Henry Pulling, and her eccentric sister, Augusta Bertram, ostensibly meet for the first time. Henry had heard stories from his mother about his Aunt Augusta, who he had assumed had long passed. Information from Augusta about his "mother" and an action by Augusta's Sierra Leonean friend Wordsworth convince Henry to agree to Augusta's request to accompany her on an imminent trip to Paris, despite Henry never having done any international traveling. It isn't until they are well on their way that Henry learns that the purpose of Augusta's trip is not to sight-see as he had assumed he would do, but rather to save the only true love that she has ever had in her unusual and unique life, an Italian by the name of Ercole Visconti. As Augusta's task takes her and Henry far beyond just Paris and as they get into one adventure after another in Augusta's often less than above board actions, Augusta and Henry will either be torn apart by their fundamental differences, or brought closer together as they begin to understand the need to be a little more like the other, the only real family they have left in the world. For Henry, what happens is also the result of coming to a realization of what Augusta's information about his mother and father really means.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saw it in Vietnam the year it was released, and it did what a movie is supposed to do - took me somewhere else, and made me forget reality for a while. Any movie that could hold the attention of a bunch of GI's under those circumstances has to be entertaining! Haven't seen the movie in over 30 years, but can recall enjoying it. What more can be expected of a movie?My recollection is the main character reminded me of a composite of two of my own aunts. Made me laugh. I'm usually not too keen on period-movies, but this one didn't overdo the genre.Good cinematography.</p>
