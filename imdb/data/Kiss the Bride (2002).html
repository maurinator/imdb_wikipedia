<h1>Kiss the Bride (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Rhode Island, in the Italian-American family Sposato, Danni is going to marry Geoffrey Brancato. Danni lives with her parents Santo and Irena and is the third and 'the good daughter' of her family. Her three sisters come for her wedding: the older Nikki, a successful TV starlet, who works in a TV show very similar to 'Baywatch'. Nikki brings her boy-friend and manager Marty Weinberg to be introduced to her family. Chrissy, who deals with investments in Wall Street; and the rebel younger Toni , who plays in a rock-and- roll band with her lesbian lover Amy Kayne. Together, they have meals in the restaurant of Tom Terranova, the former and first love of Nikki. Many discussions of the Sposato family show wounds not healed, when the characters expose their real feelings.</p>
<p>Three sisters find themselves battling for love and validation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From 2002, this was an okay movie. It's a cute, slice of life surrounding an Italian-American family as they prepare for the wedding of one of the three daughters.It has a huge cast most, of which I recognized from assorted movie and TV projects. Oddly the mother and father of the bride here are Talia Shire & Burt Young aka Adrian and Paulie of 'Rocky' fame (where they play brother and sister). This was fun casting but honestly a little weird and just felt ...well wrong.Alyssa Milano was very good here as the youngest daughter who arrives on a motorcycle with her girlfriend. I also enjoyed Sean Patrick Flanery and Frances Bay as grandma. 08.11</p>
