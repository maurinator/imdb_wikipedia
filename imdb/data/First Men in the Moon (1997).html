<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was very fun to watch. It was a radio drama staged in Vegas. The story was familiar the HG Wells story but done in a fresh and creative way. I enjoyed watching how sound effects were done in old radio days. It was also good to see various Star Trek actors together but in very different roles. I also watched the Lost World done by the same group "Alien Voices" I do not know why Lost World is not listed among the Leonard Nimoy credits? The entire Alien Voices project is not included in the list of credits for Leonard Nimoy. He was in all of them. I really liked the Alien Voices series because you got to see the lighter side of various Star Trek actors. There are many plays on words and inside jokes within the script. It was also good to see how the actors interacted with each other in the background as the scenes changed. Based on this video it appears that the actors from the various versions of Star Trek are friends as well as co-workers.</p>
