<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is without a doubt the most overrated piece of trash I have seen in my entire life. All this movie had was a guy who killed people for fun\It's hard to summon up enthusiasm for a performance so rooted in bloody banality. I mean, as Patrick, Bale's most emotionally pressing dilemma is: Chainsaw or butcher knife?It's all soooo predictable. Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Yada, yada, yada. Everything. The book was much better though,but then again it didn't have an overrated Hack like Christian Bale dragging the movie down constantly.This movie was terrible! I found it boring and stupid and the ending didn't make sense at all...definitely would not recommend seeing it! he entire thing is so shallow and masturbatory that it's very hard to care about anything that's happening. Even without a well developed character there was still the possibility that the result would have been entertaining, but the psychotic killer angle was executed without any suspense whatsoever. There never seemed to be any reason for any of the plot developments, and from the very start we are just given a character who wants to kill people for some reason. A Hollywood cheeseball overall. Bad music throughout. Everything felt fake.And Lastly I would like to add,Christian BALE IS THE MOST OVERRATED HACK OF ALL-TIME.PLEASE STOP ACTING AND SPARE US THE TORTURE.</p>
