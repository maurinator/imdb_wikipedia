<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If the writers play their cards right, 'Supernatural' season 11 has the potential of being the most explosive storyline of the series yet. 'My Brother's Keeper', the season 10 finale, has set the groundwork for that quite capably. This episode is one of those finales that leave you biting your fingernails off in anticipation of what happens next. I'll admit that season 10 overall was a mixed bag experience for me: there were several high points, some disappointing mediocrity, and a strong sense of déjà vu. But being the staunch 'Supernatural' loyalist that I am, I held on for the finale. And boy was it something!The thing that excited me the most about this episode was the return of one of my favourite guest stars of the show, one who has a killer screen presence. Literally. Unfortunately though, his presence almost invariably causes some serious distress to Sam and Dean. There was no exception this time as well. Both brothers' lives go up at stake, on separate occasions.If you've been watching 'Supernatural' this long (to continue into the 10th season), I can assume you are a fan of the Brothers Winchester and the bond they share. This episode draws attention to some major issues in Sam and Dean's relationship, their co-dependence and the compulsive need to put each other before anything and anyone else. The notion of actions being measured against their consequences is also discussed. Season 10 had mostly focused on one major theme- the Mark of Cain on Dean's arm, Dean's resultant feelings of guilt and self-loathing, and Sam's desperation to help his brother. It all comes to a head in this aptly-titled episode. The final confrontation between Dean and Sam is at once emotion-charged and action-packed. And it reminded me strongly of the Sam-Dean showdown at the end of the season 5 finale, though the positions of the brothers are reversed here. A special mention must be made of the performances of the actors. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are both just awesome in their respective roles.On a side note, Rowena unsurprisingly has a trick up her sleeve, and there is quite a lot we learn about her character and her shadowy past in the episode. Oh yes, and do look out for the Castiel-Crowley interaction. Misha Collins and Mark Sheppard share a very quirky and entertaining chemistry and are great fun to watch as always. 'Supernatural' is a show that often comes up with quite interesting twists on religious mythology as we know it. So this time, we are left with the exciting possibility of the Winchesters facing off what is probably the most powerful big bad in their checkered hunting careers. There are virtually endless possibilities in the road ahead. If you don't want to be left stumbling in the darkness, I recommend you give 'My Brother's Keeper' a shot.</p>
