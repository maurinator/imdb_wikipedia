<h1>Un jeu brutal (1983)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brisseau is The French Haneke.Like the Austrian director,his characters are beyond any moral. Cremer portrays a scientist who is also a serial killer.He's got a disabled daughter whom he treats like a dog because "she's still a beast ,only the hard way can turn her into a human being". Both hold a grudge against the whole world -the love the girl feels for Pascal will be short-lived- and the father/killer seems to use expiatory victims.This is a bleak disturbing movie which was largely ignored during the eighties but which still retains a small cult following.Avoid if you are down in the dumps.Or if you are an Eric Rohmer fan.</p>
