<h1>The Object of My Affection (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>George and Nina seem like the perfect couple. They share a cozy Brooklyn apartment, a taste for tuna casserole dinners, and a devotion to ballroom dancing. They love each other. There's only one hitch: George is gay. And when Nina announces she's pregnant, things get especially complicated. Vince - Nina's overbearing boyfriend and the baby's father-wants marriage. Nina wants independence. George will do anything for a little unqualified affection, but is he ready to become an unwed surrogate dad?</p>
<p>A pregnant New York social worker begins to develop romantic feelings for her gay best friend, and decides she'd rather raise her child with him, much to the dismay of her overbearing boyfriend.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Object of My Affection is rather heavily aimed at a gay audience - at least it seems that way to me.  It retains quite a theatrical feel; there is always the feeling that the director is conscious this is a performance, and it's not given the "natural" or "polished" feel that accompanies so many Hollywood movies. Paul Rudd is perhaps just a little camp of centre for the role of George - he is supposed to be interested in the female lead, after all.  However, it's a tricky balancing act, because if he becomes too convincingly involved, he becomes the bad guy, so it's perhaps just as well.  Some very classy moments come from his deriding of ex lover Professor Joelly, and some great gay stereotypes are held up for examination along the way. Particularly amusing was Paul's blind date with the Village People wannabe ear nose and throat specialist, and of course, the incredibly self-serving Joelly. Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest performance of the piece comes from Friends star Jennifer Anniston.  Struck by the love bug, she admirably portrays the lover in the bedroom next door, and I defy anyone not to be moved by her character's deepest lows.  No review of this film would be complete without mention of Nigel Hawthorne, who very nearly steals the limelight from Anniston with his marvelously opinionated (but very likeable) literary critic, forced to share the love of his life.  Simply put, he's brilliant. So why does The Object deserve a 10 in my opinion?  In the end, the relationships in the movie don't come down to gay or straight, or anything one can label.  They're honest to goodness relationships between people - and that's why there is an element of doubt as to who will end up where - at least part of the way through.  That's why despite it's light feel, it has the ability to evoke some really deep feelings of tragedy in just the right places.  It's everything you wouldn't expect, which is a wonderful breath of fresh air.</p>
