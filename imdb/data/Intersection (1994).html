<h1>Intersection (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vincent Eastman has to choose between his wife of 16 years, Sally, and his new love, Olivia. Frequent flashbacks explain the background to the marriage and the affair.</p>
<p>Vincent Eastman is a man who after 16 years of marriage leaves his wife for another woman. Now he's trying to decide whether to be with the woman he's with now or to go back to his wife. While trying to decide he recalls all of the important moments: how he met his wife, how their life became mundane, and how he met the woman he's with now. And people are trying to tell him what to do.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The character development was so good that you could feel Vincent's conflicted emotion as he was torn between reconciling with his classy, ultra-conservative, society, professional wife Sally or starting a new life with the casual, free-spirited, fun-loving, girl-next-door Olivia.  I had incorrectly guessed that the ending would be a predictably contrived cop-out, but found instead that it wrapped up all of the story lines in a creative, yet plausible way (for the movies) without any gimmicks or redirection.</p>
