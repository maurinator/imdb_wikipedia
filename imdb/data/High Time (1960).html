<h1>High Time (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Widower and hamburger restaurateur Harvey Howard decides to go to college at 51 years of age. Resisting the easy path, he insists on not receiving preferential treatment, and lives in a dorm like the other students despite the disapproval of his grown son and daughter. As the years pass, and he gets involved in study sessions, fraternity initiations, and sporting events, he begins falling in love with Professor Gautier, the French teacher, but doesn't consider re-marrying appropriate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bing Crosby plays a millionaire in his sunset days who decides to get his college degree.  It is very reminiscent of the 1982 Dangerfield vehicle, Back To School, only this one has entertaining songs in addition to light screwball comedy.  This is a very good movie to relax to when you're in a mode to laugh, smile, and avoid anything challenging.</p>
