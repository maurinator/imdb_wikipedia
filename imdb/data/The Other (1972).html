<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based off the book of the same name, this is a tale of two young twin boys who both appear innocent and sweet in appearance, but one of them is pure evil and is killing off all of the pesky citizens of a small mid-western town at the beginning of the 1920's.As I said in my summary line, this is one of the best horror films to grace a movie screen. Legendary acting coach Uta Hagen turns in the kind of performance that people only dream about. It seems like she also must have helped out the rest of the cast, because everyone surronding her turns in their best work to date. The film doesn't pile on the blood, but what it lacks in blood it certainly makes up for in suspense and sheer terror. It has a dazzling array of plot developments you just don't see coming from miles away and it is equally sad, scary, and beautiful. The director just hasn't crafted a great horror film, he has crafted a truly great film. It should stand out as one of the best modern day films. I don't want to give away too much details about the film, because it could end up ruining your movie watching experience, but I will say this, it certainly is a film that should be required viewing. It was one of those films that took me by complete surprise. A totally professional production in every respect.Rated PG; Violence.</p>
