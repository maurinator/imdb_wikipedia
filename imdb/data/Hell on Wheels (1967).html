<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't like race car driving, especially in a circle, but this 1967 movie is great. The star is Marty Robbins. He is a wonderful singer who in addition to his many country hits even had a giant Rock & Roll hit in 1956, "A White Sport Coat." Connie Smith also sings, and she was then the number one female singer in Country Music. In the 60's and 70's she had many hits, including one, "Once a Day", which was number one on the Billboard charts for eight weeks making it the biggest hit recording in all of the history of Country Music ever recorded by a female singer. In the mid 60's she had three number one (on the Billboard charts) record albums. She is the best female singer ever recorded.Also, appearing in this movie is the Stoneman Family, a bluegrass country folk band, who were even popular with San Franciscans at the Winterland Auditorium. Together they sold many millions of record albums and CDs. This movie's villains are old, wimpy, and are so vastly outnumbered by the good guys that the atmosphere is relaxed. The movie is an excuse to show the wonderful singing and music.This is the last real movie of long time child star Gigi Perreau. Also, it stars Bob Dornan in one of his last movies. He went on to politics being elected to Congress from California for many years, and he got the nickname B-1 Bob, for promoting the B-1 Bomber. Contrary to someone's comment there is no nose picking in this movie. See this movie for the singing and music.</p>
