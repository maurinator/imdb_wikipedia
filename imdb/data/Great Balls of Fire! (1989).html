The question is will he make it, or will his young wife and his stubborn pride keep him from being the killer himself?</p>
<p>The life and career of wildly controversial rock 'n' roll star Jerry Lee Lewis.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Personally I disagree with the other user's comments as I saw this movie on TV a while ago and really enjoyed it. What makes it so interesting is the fact that someone would actually go ahead and marry their cousin who was only 13 years old.This movie is pretty accurate and the acting and music is great.Dennis Quaid's portrayal of the Killer is definitely one to watch.His accent and facial expressions are priceless and Winona Ryder's Myra is sweet and believable. This movie offers a great insight into the personal life, music and career of J.L.L. A really enjoyable film I would highly recommend :-D</p>
