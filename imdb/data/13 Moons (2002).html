<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented 13 Moons because I love Steve Buscemi. It was an amazing movie- full of twists and turns, humor, and reality. It was a touching film without being sappy. Its just one of those must sees, I think. The basic premise is that a little boy needs a new kidney. A cousin of his happens to be in the hospital, but said cousin is a drunken santa dude who escapes and tries to have one last night of mayhem. Strangers become involved in his pursuit, including a clown who has lost his humor, a priest who has lost his god, a stripper, a rapper, a mother to be who isn't anymore, a midget, and others. The cinematography was very different- kind of like American beauty. bottom line- this movie gave me hope.</p>
