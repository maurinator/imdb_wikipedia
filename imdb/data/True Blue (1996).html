<h1>True Blue (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the year the Oxford and Cambridge boat race changed from a gentleman's race to one where winning was everything.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on the true story of an American at Oxford swearing to overcome defeat in the 1986 Boat Race (Oxford's first defeat to Cambridge in 11 years) by returning the following year with some international colleagues and the resultant "mutiny" when they refuse to follow the coach's training schedules.The film is a fictionalised account and comes down firmly (as did the book on which it is based) on the side of chief coach Dan Topolski and OUBC President Donald MacDonald. It's not a half bad attempt at telling a story with a good bash at both trying to underline the importance in the old universities of the boat race and the physical demands the race makes.The rowing is reasonably portrayed too, using real oarsmen as their opposition and with the actors having been taught to row by Topolski, but sometimes the continuity is lost and there are mistakes aplenty if you really try to go looking for them!It's not a film that challenges, but it does entertain - although how much it entertains a dry-bob is the big question!</p>
