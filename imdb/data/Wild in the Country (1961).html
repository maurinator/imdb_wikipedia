<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wild in the Country is a solid film and one of Presley's best. Elvis is excellent as a delinquent who happens to be a potentially terrific writer.  Psychiatrist Hope Lange helps Elvis achieve his potential and they slowly fall for each other. Elvis only sings a couple of songs here and therefore, instead of a musical, we get a dramatic story that's well acted by all three leads and is genuinely captivating, only falls short towards the end and goes for a sappy conclusion.   Overall, one of Presley's best films and he once again proves what a great actor he could have been. 7 out of 10.</p>
