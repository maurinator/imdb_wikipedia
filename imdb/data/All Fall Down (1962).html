<h1>All Fall Down (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ralph and Annabell Willart are a feuding couple who are constantly bickering over their worthless, good-for nothing son Berry-Berry. When Berry-Berry begins yet another meaningless love affair, this time with an older woman named Echo O'Brien, he really gets his parents at each others' throats.</p>
<p>Twenty-something Berry-Berry Willart has left his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio primarily to get away from his overbearing mother and alcoholic father, Annabell and Ralph Willart, as Berry-Berry doesn't like the way they treat him as the prodigal son. Berry-Berry has always taken the easy way out, and will often use his good looks to take advantage of women, who are initially more than willing to help out this good looking young man until they really get to know him. But his parents, especially Annabell, believe he can do no wrong. And his bright sixteen year old brother, Clinton Willart, idolizes him. Although Berry-Berry originally had no intention of ever returning to Cleveland which Ralph realizes but Annabell refuses to acknowledge in her heart, he decides to head back to Cleveland but initially not tell his family. Berry-Berry's trip home coincides with a visit the Willarts receive from a family friend, thirty-one year old Echo O'Brien. It's love at first sight between Berry-Berry and Echo. Although Clinton, who loves Echo himself with Echo in turn loving him like her best kid brother, gives Berry-Berry his blessing with Echo, Clinton, deep in his heart, is afraid that Echo will end up just another one of the long string of women that Berry-Berry has abused.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many of the earlier posts on this film mirror my overall impressions as well. I caught this on TCM a few weeks ago and I was compelled to keep watching despite some flaws and very awkward scenes. This film has that distinctive early 60's feel to it and also is lacking certain elements of specificity in its storytelling and character development. The Willart family is dysfunctional but we are not able to put our finger on the dynamics of exactly why. We know the father, Karl Malden, is an alcoholic, yet a noticeably genial and upbeat one. We know the mother, Angela Lansbury, seems perpetually stressed and perhaps emotionally isolated, but the dialogue between the two never gets to the heart of their unhappiness. The late Brandon de Wilde (who died in 1972 in an auto accident) is the younger of two brothers through whose perspective the story is told. He is an aspiring writer who spies and eavesdrops on his parents' conversations and records what he hears in a journal. I thought his overall performance was very effective and believable. A young Warren Beatty in one of his first major roles plays the older son, the wayward Berry-Berry. (His name is puzzling and one wonders why nobody thinks to call him Berry for short.) Eva Marie Saint plays a somewhat mysterious woman, Echo, who provides the basis of the storyline through her involvement with both brothers. I found it to be a flaw of the film, though a minor one, that we never know much about Echo....what her background is, how she came to be close friends with Mrs. Willart, what she does for a living, and why she is driving such an unusual car. An absorbing story once you get drawn into it, with several awkward scenes balanced out by several touching and poignant moments.</p>
