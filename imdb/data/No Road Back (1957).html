<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It seems as if Monty Tully wanted to make this film as different as he could from the run of the mill crime films.So we have the joint head of the gang being a blind and deaf woman with a perfect speaking voice.We also have Sean Connery in an early role stuttering every fifth word in his brief speeches.Paul Carpenter who normally plays the hero this time plays the villain.Despite the fact that he seems to do all the organising he relies almost the whole time for his partner in crime to undertake the fencing of the proceeds of crime notwithstanding her disabilities.Eleanor Summerfield is the barmaid in a club without customers.Skip Homier is the unlikely American lead who disappears about two thirds the way through only to reappear at the end.Despite all this it is rather entertaining.</p>
