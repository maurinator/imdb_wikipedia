<h1>Traveling Companion (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Rome, Cora is a waitress at a club, walks people's dogs, sleeps with various men, kips with pals, and has a salty tongue. She also has a bruised history: her mother's suicide, her brother's mental illness. Ada, a dog-owning client, hires her to follow Ada's aged and courtly father every day. The dad, a retired philology professor, has a touch of dementia, sometimes forgetting where he is; Cora is to keep him in sight, phoning Ada if the professor has difficulties. On the third day, he takes a train out of Rome, and Cora follows on what proves to be a journey into her best and worst selves. She becomes his traveling companion, but what does he become to her?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Want to watch a movie about a fast-minded young woman whose job is to shadow a slow-moving old man suffering from Alzheimer's? then this movie is for you.Many scenes and takes were painfully slow. Does the audience really needed to suffer from such slow takes? The opening scene, for example, shows the old man slowly trying to figure out how to put on a tie. I kid-you-not, it took three minutes.Other scenes that were just to slow were the scenes inside train stations, inside mass-transit buses, inside moving trains. Maybe the director wanted to send a message to the audience: traveling is slow and nothing happens.There were outdoor scenes of small towns in the Umbria region. Small towns like Lugnano in Teverina. Yet, very little was done in taking advantage of such locations. Why even bother, then, of shooting takes in these towns.</p>
