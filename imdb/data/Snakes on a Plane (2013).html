<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Usually the protagonists of "Locked Up Abroad" have smuggled drugs. This time around, it's exotic snakes, tarantulas, and other creepy crawlers.This episode's subject is portrayed as failing to get permits for these creatures and finally gets arrested. Rather than face trial, he flees to Belize, from which the US Fish and Wildlife Service succeeds in having him deported.But first the man has to survive the type of hellhole prison that is typical of this series, a place where the weapons-wielding inmates often seem to call the shots.The protagonist's international contraband is atypical of this series, but his actions seem familiar in that laws are skirted. In one instance, a customs official is bitten by a concealed tarantula and subsequently keels over. In another case, a concealed king cobra is shipped by air despite its capability to deliver a fatal bite.We learn in the epilogue that the subject of this episode was sentenced to 30 months behind bars -- and that once released, he started another reptile business. One wonders how he handled that operation.As always in a "Locked Up Abroad" episode, there are unanswered questions. First on my mind was what exactly attracts the subject to creatures many abhor. We may wonder but never are told.</p>
