<h1>Cattle Drive (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The spoilt young son of a wealthy railroad owner manages to get himself lost in the middle of nowhere. He is found by a cowboy on a cattle drive and the lad must start learning the hard lessons of working in a team if he wants to make it to San Diego.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Solid script, good plot, strong performances - especially from the young Dean Stockwell - and superb scenery make for a very entertaining film. Nothing gimmicky in technique but solid and professional with a decent pace. Story has an excellent moral being the taming of a spoilt Eastern kid by a gang of experienced cowboys on a cattle drive.  It is, however, not a typical kid's picture - it has a wide appeal and works for adults as well as children.  Reviewed January 2001 on a very rare appearance on British television.</p>
