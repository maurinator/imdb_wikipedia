<h1>Africa Express (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Baxter is a freewheeling trader of goods in Africa with a pet chimp and one dream: to save enough money to buy his dream gas station in Detroit. Madeleine Cooper is the lady of mystery he runs into as she flees from big game hunter Jack Palance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Several of the locals were used in bit parts in the film. One of these locals was Fanie Pretorius, who was a top hunter in the 70's. He is now retired, but remains something of a legend in the Victoria Falls region (more so for his knowledge of the African bush than his role in the movie).In the film, he does a scene with Ursula Andress and plays (co-incidentally) a hunter. He even had a few lines of dialogue!Definitely a great film that captures the essence of Africa in the 70's.</p>
