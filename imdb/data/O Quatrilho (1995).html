<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie calls my attention in so many ways. It tells the story of two of the hundreds of families that came from Italy to Brazil in late 19th century and beginning of the 20th, looking for a better life for them and their children.The movie talks about a couple of Italian families, with their own costumes and habits. The main characters are two women an two men, trying to fit in a conservative society. That's the basic thing about the film, that was filmed in the south of Brazil, with some really beautiful shots of this Brazilian region."O Quatrilho" not just deserved an Oscar nomination as Best Foreign Language Film, but also has to be remembered as one of the best Brazilian movies ever made. If you haven't seen it, rent it and take a look in this masterpiece of Bruno Barreto's brother: FÃ¡bio Barreto.</p>
