<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent movie, one of my all-time favorites.  I watch it more often than I listen to "Die Zauberflote" on CD.Bergman changes the story slightly and shuffles some of the musical pieces around, but the result makes better sense than the original.  Pamina's struggle is presented as a custody battle between Mother and Father.  The depression of wintertime in the far north is brought out clearly in the attempted-suicide scene.  And all the knicknacks and props lying around...are pure Sweden!  I didn't realize that until I visited Gothenburg last fall.Bergman's comical, warm and cozy images really fit the music.  Not that "The Magic Flute" from Mozart needs much improving...after all, 9 out of 10 German composers agree that it is the "perfect" German Opera.  But Bergman's images go with it so well I consider it the perfect staging of the opera.</p>
