<h1>The Killer Elite (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mike Locken is one of the principal members of a group of freelance spies. A significant portion of their work is for the C.I.A. and while on a case for them, one of his friends turns on him and shoots him in the elbow and knee. His assignment, to protect someone, goes down in flames. He is nearly crippled, but with braces is able to again become mobile. For revenge as much as anything else, Mike goes after his ex-friend.</p>
<p>Mike Locke, who works for a private security firm affiliated with the CIA, is betrayed by his partner and left apparently crippled for life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Entertaining and fairly gritty look at the real life undercover spooks who do the CIA's dirty work or sometimes are bought by the highest bidder. Contains some parallels to Peckinpah's greatest film THE WILD BUNCH in that it explores themes of obsolescence, integrity, loyalty, and friendship. Caan and Duvall are at the top of their game and supporting actors Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, and Gig Young lend credibility as guys who are willing to play the dirty game.Jerry Fielding score as in THE WILD BUNCH is superb.  4 out of 5 stars</p>
