<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My husband found a box of old VHS movies after moving into a new home recently. I finally decided to watch this and thought it would be like a "Free Willy" or something. I planned to watch it with my toddler but she fell asleep and I'm glad she did. I thought it was going to be a really kiddie movie but it turned out to be great! I loved the story line, the adventure, it kept my interest to the very end. The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it did seem a tad bit too long...my hubby kept popping in saying is that movie still on? Nevertheless, I was thoroughly entertained. I found it delightful and wholesome but with an edge. It's nice to escape with a good film that makes u feel good especially with so much garbage that's out there today.</p>
