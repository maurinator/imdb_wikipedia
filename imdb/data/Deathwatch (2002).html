<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1917, in the Western front, a group of survivors of the British Company Y reach the most forward German trench in a foggy night. They capture a German soldier that advises that evil is in the trench, forcing the soldiers to kill each other, and asks them to leave the place. Only the private Charlie Shakespeare listens and helps the prisoner, while a supernatural force scares and makes the soldiers insane.</p>
<p>In the brutal trench fighting of the First World War, a British Infantry Company is separated from their regiment after a fierce battle. Attempting to return to their lines, the British soldiers discover what appears to be a bombed out German trench, abandoned except for a few dazed German soldiers. After killing most of the Germans, and taking one prisoner, the British company fortifies to hold the trench until reinforcements can arrive. Soon, however, strange things being to happen as a sense of evil descends on the trench and the British begin turn on each other.</p>
<p>In the middle of World War I, nine British soldiers caught behind enemy lines seek refuge in a complex network of German trenches. What they soon discover is that they aren't alone - and it isn't a German soldier that's hunting them down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was looking forward to this movie because we have not seen one about World War 1 for quite some time and the trailers looked promising. Okay, I knew something odd was going to be happening but I never expected mish mash.The battle was short and brief, with the rapid cutting I didn't quite catch what was going on, but it looked reasonable enough. Then the film started to lose perspective. We suddenly appear at a trench and what follows may as well be a collection of scenes and deaths all spliced together. There is no plot, no story, no justification. When things start happening that are unexplainable, films today will normally give us an explanation, or a clue at least. Deathwatch gives us nothing. Hence the flow of the film suffers with little story linking it all together. This also destroys any tension or involvement we may have the characters. What was the purpose of this film?This is quite a shame, because the actors tried to put a good spin on affairs, and nobody showed themselves up despite the lack of flow. On the good side, the set, props, uniforms, weapons are all sound.It certainly had potential, but the story was seriously lacking which resulted in a less than satisfactory film. Better luck next time fellas.</p>
