<h1>The Perfect Furlough (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>To pacify 104 sex-starved male soldiers building an Arctic radar base, Army psychologist Vicki Loren suggests choosing one by lot to have a "perfect furlough" as selected by the men: three weeks in Paris with their favorite pin-up queen, Sandra Roca. Since "winner" Paul Hodges is a tireless Don Juan, and this is a fifties comedy, Vicki is ordered to keep Paul and Sandra out of bed. But who will guard the guardian?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This isn't a perfect movie. It's unlikely to end up on anyone's ten best list in any category. But it's a perfectly enjoyable way to wile away 90 minutes.Briefly, it's the story of an oversexed serviceman, Curtis, who manages to win a three-week furlough in Paris with an Argentine bombshell-movie "actress". That's the first part of the movie, and it's pretty obvious.In the second half, Curtis' character falls in love with Janet Leigh's character, an army psychologist who has been sent to Paris to keep Curtis' character from having sex with the bombshell or otherwise embarrassing the American military while on furlough in Paris. There is actual chemistry between the two - not a surprise, as they evidently married after making this movie - and the scenes between the two of them are more than just slapstick by the book.The ending is obvious, but what you would expect from a 1950s romantic comedy.Unlike a lot of other American movies set in Paris in the 1950s, this one doesn't do much with the location. But that's fine.Not a great movie, certainly, but not a bad one.</p>
