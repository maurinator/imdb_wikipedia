<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>a typical Hindi film - but oh, the beauty and the tenderness and the warmth of the love story...its the reason i fell i love with films! not to forget the fact that it gave Hindi cinema one of its biggest stars - salman khan. his casting couldn't have been more perfect. forgive me for sounding cheesy, but those big, wounded eyes packed in a punch. there wasn't a single member of the female species unaffected - old and young, mums and daughters, teenage girls and grandmas. and the reason he was so effective - a near perfect film with wonderfully appealing characters, almost unbearably tender romance, and a dash of healthy drama! play it again sam!!</p>
