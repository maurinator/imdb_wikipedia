<h1>Casanova 70 (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Andrea Rossi-Colombotti, a U.N. official and modern-day Casanova, cannot get aroused unless there's danger in sex, but women and society are too compliant, so he's often impotent. A psychiatrist warns him it will get worse, and he should be celibate. Andrea tries and fails at that, abandons his fiancée, finds the occasional life-threatening liaison, and pursues a woman tethered to a dull but murderous husband. Will Andrea find pleasure and fulfillment, or is he doomed to pursue and then go limp when the pursuit is successful?</p>
<p>The amorous adventures of Andrea Rossi-Colombotti, an army officer who finds pleasure with beautiful women in life-threatening situations.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Casanova '70" is a colourful movie directed by Mario Monicelli, one of the Italian comedy masters. The film follows the sexual adventures of Andrea (Marcello Mastroianni), a handsome "Casanova" who thinks being impotent, in reality he only needs danger for being excited and conquer women...The film is a product of its time (we clearly see that we're in 1965!), but it's funny and teases the myth of Italian "macho". The merit of the picture is talking about sex without being vulgar. Mastroianni shows a comical approach and is at ease, also the rest of the cast enjoy (we see, among others, gorgeous women like Virna Lisi, Michèle Mercier and Marisa Mell...). In a role -Mell's husband- we find Italian director Marco Ferreri, famous for "outrageous" movies like "La grande bouffe", "Tales of ordinary madness", "Bye bye Monkey" and long time friend of Marcello Mastroianni.Once more, when we see such films we miss an extremely vivacious Italian cinema which doesn't exist any more.</p>
