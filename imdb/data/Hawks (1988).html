<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If I were to compare this movie to another I would say that it is sort of like a cross between "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Patch Adams". Granted it is not as good as Nest was, however it is not nearly as horrid as "Patch Adams" so I say it is closer to Cuckoo's Nest than the other. I mainly compare it to Patch as the two lead gentlemen in this film have a terminal illness and they try to cope with it and do so in a humorous way at times. They are thankfully spared someone who is perfectly fine telling jokes and making light of the situation. The film is about two terminally ill guys who are in a hospital in I believe London. One is an American and the other does seem to be a resident of London. At first the American is kind of down in the dumps, but the other guy named Bancroft and played by Dalton tries to get him to loosen up. At one point he even wheels him onto the roof of the building. They both finally get out of the hospitals clutches and proceed to live life to the fullest with the little time they have left. On the way to their final destination, a brothel in Amsterdam, they come across two ladies whom they attach to and the four begin to have fun. Unfortunately, the American's illness does seem to be taking hold of him fast and so there is not the happiest of endings to this one. However, it is not all that sad either.</p>
