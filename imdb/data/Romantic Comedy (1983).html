<h1>Romantic Comedy (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two of the screen's finest comic actors, Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen, star as successful writing partners whose timing is perfect on stage but amusingly pathetic in their love life. In HD.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a light romantic drama this is a good film. As a fan of Dudley Moore as a comic actor, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The Norwegian video-cover indicated that it should be a very funny movie about am man who loses his partner and his wife on the same day, and how he manages his life after that. (Not a very good summary of the film!)I didn't find this movie particularly funny. But I really liked the film! The romantic tension is present whenever Moore and Steenburgen is in the same room. The lack of romantic tension between Moore and Eilber is even better made.The way it all turned out was very clever made, and when I thought that I understood how it was going to end, the story made an new turn.Not one of the biggest moments in movie history, but a good film when you are in a romantic mood, and want something light to relax with.</p>
