<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I know that some people are down on this movie, but I absolutely LOVE it. It has great ideals and good (not great) acting.  It tells a story about the circus in a pseudo-documentary.  The story has love, action, and humor. Three things that are missing from much of today's movie.  I also love the color and the dramatic "feel" of the film for that era.  It's a wonderful, wonderful, piece of 'Americana'.</p>
