<h1>Latin Lovers (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nora Taylor has $37,000,00 but thinks every man she meets prefers her bankbook figure to her own, and that include her current fianc√©, Paul Chevron, who has $48,000,000 of his own. Paul goes to Brazil to play some polo, and Nora follows along. There, she meets and falls for Roberto Santos, whom she thinks has no money, who is really overjoyed when he discovers she has a lot of money. This depresses her somewhat. But, this being a big-budget MGM film, which means that the two top-billed characters have to end up together, winds up with Metro-plot-218 that says Roberto has a few potatoes (or bananas) of his own and is just pleased to find out she isn't a gold digger after his money. The rich get richer and the poor need not apply.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautiful blonde Lana Turner (as Nora Taylor) worries men may want her because she is worth $37 million dollars. She is engaged to handsome blond John Lund (as Paul Chevron), who is worth $48 million dollars. It sounds like a good match, but Ms. Turner is still worried. When she was poor, a greedy boy stole all her marbles, she tells her analyst. Both Turner and Mr. Lund go to picturesque Brazil, where he plays polo. Turner wears expensive clothes and meets muscle-glistening Ricardo Montalban (as Roberto Santos). They are mutually attracted. Turner decides to hide her $37 million estate from Mr. Montalban, because she (now) thinks men are not interested in marrying beautiful and wealthy women. Honest. This story is as silly as it sounds. However, it is worth watching to see how the crew at MGM could pull out the big guns; in this case, for Turner and Montalban. The production always looks great.***** Latin Lovers (8/12/53) Mervyn LeRoy ~ Lana Turner, Ricardo Montalban, John Lund, Louis Calhern</p>
