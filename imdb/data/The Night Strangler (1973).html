<h1>The Night Strangler (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Reporter Carl Kolchak is now in Seattle, Washington, trying to solve the mystery of several strangulations that recur every few years where the victims are drained of blood in this second made for TV pilot.</p>
<p>After being run out of Las Vegas, Kolchak heads for Seattle and another reporting job with the local paper. It's not long before he is on the trail of another string of bizarre murders. It seems that every 21 years, for the past century, a killer kills a certain number of people, drains them of their blood and then disappears into the night, that is until the next 21 years passes. Kolchak is on his trail, but the question is, can he stop him before he disappears again?</p>
<p>Reporter Carl Kolchak is back and this time he is on the trail of a serial killer who is targeting dancers in the Seattle area. The strange thing about the killings is the fact that all the victims had some of their spinal fluid drained and that there was rotting flesh found around the victims necks. Soon Kolchak learns that similar killings have been occurring in the Seattle area every twenty-one years for over 100 years. The trail soon leads to Seattle's underground city and he winds up meeting the killer who tells him that he uses the spinal fluid for a elixir which has been keeping him alive. Unfortunately, it only lasts for twenty-one years and after that time period is up he must leave his abode and go looking for fresh victims. It is now up to Kolchak to stop this madman before he takes the elixir.</p>
<p>A reporter hunts down a 144-year old alchemist who is killing women for their blood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Relocated to Seattle, reporter Kolchak stumbles on yet another series of murders, a series which seems to be repeated every twenty-one years.  Of the two movies, `The Night Strangler' has the slight edge.  This is possibly down to its location, Seattle.  Very unfamiliar to me, it adds certain freshness to the story, while the underground Â‘old' Seattle is a fantastic location, macabre and memorable; it sticks in my mind long after watching the movie.  The candle lit, cob-webbed corpses are perhaps one of the most vivid images in American genre television.Also of note is Richard Anderson's villain, a crazed, immortality seeking Doctor, he is far more impressive than the original's vampire.  A more assured script (which is genuinely funny in places), plus some enjoyable cameo's (Carradine, Hamilton), help make this a rare sequel which is better than the original.Sadly, plans for a third movie were abandoned and instead a short-lived, inferior television series (without Matheson's involvement) resulted.  A patchy effort, despite McGavin's best efforts it never attained the quality of the two movies.</p>
