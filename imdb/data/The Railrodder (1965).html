<h1>The Railrodder (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After reading an newspaper advertisement in the London Times about touring Canada, an elderly Englishman decides to do just that. Following his long walk across the Atlantic Ocean, Keaton travels along the Canadian National Railway tracks on a railway motorcar (speeder), performing a few stunts reminiscent of those in his younger days.</p>
<p>After literally walking to Canada from England, Buster takes a cross-country trip across Canada on a railway motorcar (speeder).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was pure Buster. Although it was not a silent film, there was no dialog, and the feel was like one of his best silent features, The General (1927). This was a fine movie and perhaps his last performance in his old style.</p>
