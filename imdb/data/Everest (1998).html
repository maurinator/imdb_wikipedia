<h1>Everest (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An international team of climbers ascends Mt. Everest in the spring of 1996. The film depicts their lengthy preparations for the climb, their trek to the summit, and their successful return to Base Camp. It also shows many of the challenges the group faced, including avalanches, lack of oxygen, treacherous ice walls, and a deadly blizzard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to see this historic achievement in film while it was playing at a near-by IMAX screen.  This film is as close as I EVER care to get to that mountain of death.  The filmmakers have captured images that are unlike anything ever imagined before.  And while most of the story is already well known (through best sellers THE CLIMB and INTO THIN AIR) the film still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat (and on the edge of a crevice).  What else could one want?  An IMAX movie on how this camera crew shot this film.  Prepared to be astounded and blown away!</p>
