<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Weird" Al Yankovic once admitted that "UHF" was just a big excuse to be goofy, and you'd better believe that it is. Containing every wacky gag imaginable, the movie tells the story of slacker George Newman (Yankovic), who inherits a defunct TV station, and creates a bunch of loony shows, thereby becoming the most popular station in town, and then has to fight off the vampiric corporate CEO R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), who owns a typical TV station and doesn't like competition.Like Yankovic said, it's an excuse to be goofy. Whether it's "Gandhi II", "Conan the Librarian" or "Wheel of Fish", "UHF" is truly one movie that could only come out of "Weird" Al Yankovic's mind. The only scene where "Weird" Al sings is the "Beverly Hillbillies" sequence, but the nonstop sight gags will have you dying of laughter guaranteed.</p>
