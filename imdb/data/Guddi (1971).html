<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vintage Hrishikesh Mukherjee...A classic movie, now etched in the hall of fame of Indian cinema, of how a schoolgirl falls in love with a man she sees in the movies...Dharmendra plays the part of the movie star with ease...it's almost like he's playin himself...Utpal Dutt once again shows his knack for humor...But, it's Jaya Bhaduri ( Now Mrs.Bachchan ) who steals the show.This was her breakthrough into mainstream cinema, and she does it like a pro...showing that she was a force to reckon with during those days...Rating - Whopping 9/10</p>
