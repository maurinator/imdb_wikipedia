The plot calls for the double to make a televised speech endorsing a takeover by the general. Phelps & Co. must rescue the Cardinal. The IMF's plan includes Rollin impersonating another Cardinal and Phelps pretending to be a doctor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the missions where things don't go so smoothly. Interesting opening contains one of the older magazine covers for Cinnamon whereas the previous aired episode had a newer cover shot for her. I originally came back to this site through Barbara Babcock who was the actress portraying a Major in Nuns garb. She had a very familiar look yet I couldn't place her. Theodore Bikel does a superlative job as the heavy in the piece. This is an episode that as the viewer you pay attention to all of the detail that the creative team did in crafting this teleplay, you will enhance your enjoyment as you know that this is an above average entry compared to the typical drama of this type, yet it is why Mission Impossible always stood out as the little things are rarely overlooked in the series. One thing I noticed in this season so far is that cigarette smoking in each episode of the season to this point was a constant and not limited to just the main cast.</p>
