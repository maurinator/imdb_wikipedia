The operation goes well until some unknown man kills both the killer and Mike.Mike's boss, Ray Silak (Philip Bosco) says it was the killer who killed Mike but Rollie knows it wasn't. Silak is involved with Mike's death, so he calls on Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy), the cop from the last movie, who is now a P.I., for help and they discover it's not just Silak they have to worry about.</p>
<p>Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown) and Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) team up once more to use their special effects and investigation skills (respectively), to find those responsible for the death of a cop (Tom Mason) who knew too much.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You can only appreciate this sequel if you saw the first one as there are so many references to it. Whereas the first one was quirky, original and well produced this one isn't. It's just OK.There are too many silly behaviours and plot holes to mention like leaving the killer to get up and walk away for no good reason when they could easily have got him. Plus its full of the usual clich√©s. The two actors are wasted in a film with much lower production costs. It looks and feels a bit cheap. Even the so called special effects aren't up to much.The actors work well together but I think Dennehy is the one that adds character and depth and saves the film.So all in all a disappointment. I'll be watching the first one again sometime but not this one.</p>
