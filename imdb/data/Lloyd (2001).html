<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this film when it was on HBO, and since then, I have bought it on DVD so i can watch it whenever i want. Anyway, it is a movie about this oddball in a class of midde-aged kids, who wants to go out with this girl called Tracy. Anyway, the story focuses on Lloyd, and how he keeps doing these inept attemps at winning Tracy's heart. It's a sweet story with a valuable lesson that is "Be thankfull for who you are". Definately worth a look. 7.5/10</p>
