<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Amusing film about an apartment with solely female tenants that suffers from an infestation of rats and pint sized Germans. Dr. Karl Gunther, the son of a Mengele-type Nazi doctor, is the superintendent of this complex with a predilection for renting only to women so he can of course spy on them via his completely dust-free airvent system all the while harassing them with his various rats-in-the-wall contraptions. I guess simply watching them in various states of undress was too lowbrow for this movie. Anyway, when a nosy tenant is dispatched by one of his rather creative but not too efficient killing devices it opens up a room for rent for another victim of the terror from tiny town. Enter Lori Bancroft whom the Dr. becomes instantly smitten with. After becoming acquainted with her fellow housemates (did I mention Tane!) she begins to hear strange noises from the airvents and becomes increasingly distressed. When Lori is visited by Josef Steiner, who by the way comes off less grieving brother and more creepy jerk, she is informed that Dr. Gunther was implicated in a series of multiple deaths while he was a doctor in South America with Josef's brother being one of them. This bombshell revelation leads Lori to investigate what's inside Dr. Gunther's apartment exposing his twisted reality. Woman in a cage with tongue cut out. Check. Nazi memorabilia. Check. Torture devices. Check. Backissues of Cat Fancy. None, though that would of been hilarious.Crawlspace needs to be categorized with movies like Chucky, Troll, and Puppet Master as films whose villains you must suspend belief in in order to watch. Klaus Kinski knows his limitations and doesn't try to play counter to that but the notion of this little man with his bizarre facial contortions as he speaks his lines as menacing to humans five feet or taller is laughable. Young children maybe but adults, come on! The concept of Dr. Gunther spying on the ladies is the kind of sleazy titillation that would of enhanced the watchability of this film since it is such a major component of the storyline yet it does no such thing. We get one topless scene by Tane McClure (see I knew there was a reason she was in this!) and that's it. Weak. Sauce. I did enjoy his bizarre killing techniques especially the chair with the built-in surprise as well as his sickening relationship with a woman he keeps in a cage. The final encounter with Lori and a lipstick smeared Dr. Gunther in full Nazi uniform is awfully silly, even for trashy films, and makes me wonder why the first forty minutes was so tame. Talia Balsam as the lead Lori Bancroft with her unflattering wardrobe is not a bad looking woman by any means (she was married to George Clooney) just not the perfect choice for this film. The lovely Tane! would have made a better object of desire. I guess Klaus couldn't see that high. Music is done by Pino Donaggio but really folks how many times have you left a movie and said "That movie really sucked but that score rocked!". That would be none. Tane!</p>
