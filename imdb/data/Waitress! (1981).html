<h1>Waitress! (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three lovely waitresses contend with a drunken, slovenly chef and mutinous patrons.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is so full of sight gags and comedy madness, that it will take multiple viewings to catch them all. The film brilliantly captures the world of New York City restaurants, and the many people working as wait staff workers, trying to break into show business. This film has gratuitous breasts, and farting, enough to cause major laughs. As far as a time capsule, this film has many shots showing "old New York City" which is fun to see. Look for a very young Chris Noth in a tiny bit part. Kaufmann has done it again, delivered a masterpiece on a small budget thus proving the point that anyone can make their own damn movie. ****</p>
