<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to say that I would never have watched this films by some of the reviews I read online, but glad I took a chance. It is a delightful film! I will admit I was pleasantly surprised with how much I did like it. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a DVD copy for my own film library. Yes the story is corny by today's standards, but then again I can only take so much of 'today's standards'. This is a light, funny and wonderfully musical film that has a beginning, a middle, and an end unlike most films that are produced today. Love Virginia Mayo, who looks more beautiful in color than you could imagine.Dennis Morgan sings...who could ask for more! A great movie for a rainy afternoon...nothing more than pure entertainment!</p>
