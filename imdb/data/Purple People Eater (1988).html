<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Purple people eater is a classic! There is no way anyone with a camcorder could do better! I would definitely rent this and watch and take back to my family to see! This movie is really cute and families can sit down and watch it together! Plus, the theme song is off the hook! Anyone who doesn't like it is outta their mind! Every one i know loved it, i haven't heard one bad thing about it, ever. My whole family enjoys it, and their ages rank from 43 to 6! this movie is definitely one of a kind and should be watched by everyone! The purple people eater himself totally rocks, i would highly recommend everyone going out and renting this and taking it back to their families to watch and enjoy! I LOVED IT!!</p>
