<h1>F comme Fairbanks (1976)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is not only a tribute to the American silent film industry, but also the perfect example of what the terrific Patrick Dewaere's skills were. He gives here one of his best performances. His character could not have been played by anyone else but him. It even seems that the film was made just for him. And only him. It is very moving to watch in this feature both Miou Miou and Dewaere, who were together in real life but just about to divorce. I saw this film as a sort of existentialist tale. What a surprise too John Berry, former director from the early fifties who was black listed because of McCarthysm...Patrick Dewaere is shown as himself in this film, he seems naked to me, with his skin deep real personality. Moving and somewhat depressing movie, but awesome. I am surprised no one has commented it yet.</p>
