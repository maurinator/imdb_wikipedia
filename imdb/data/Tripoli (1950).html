<h1>Tripoli (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The U. S. Marine Corps hymn starts with"From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli", and this film's story purports to be the reason why, and is give or take a few incidents in this movie: It is 1805 and the Tripoli pirates have challenged America's right to freedom of the seas---all of them, anywhere---so United Stares warships were sent to that port to bottle up their fleet and set the riff-raff right concerning who could sail where. (History begins to suffer a bit along about this point.) A U. S. Marine unit, headed by Lieutenant O'Bannon, was sent to attack them from the rear. He organized his unit around Hamet, Pasha of Tripoli, in exile after being overthrown by his brother. In Hamet's court was Sheila D'Arneau, a diploma's daughter, who disguises herself as a dancing girl, and joins the group of eight U. S. Marines and Hamet supporters in their march across the Libyan desert. O'Bannon and Shelia argue all the way to Tripoli.</p>
<p>In 1805, the United States battles the pirates of Tripoli as the Marines fight to raise the American flag</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The audience gets jipped out of seeing an interesting film because Hollywood is too busy writing checks for unnecessary production values that cost the studio a small mint.See the oxen, camels, and fake palm trees as John Payne runs around trying not to look too embarrassed wearing his marching band hat. Meanwhile, Maureen O'Hara does her spitting and grunting shtick as she scowls through the whole flick (as usual). Mostly boring with few script directions.Hollywood put a lot of effort into these silly costume adventures because the producers are all deadheads with a penchant for wasting time and money.</p>
