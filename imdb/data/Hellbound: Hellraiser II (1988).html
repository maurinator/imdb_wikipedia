<h1>Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain. But Channard has been searching for the doorway to Hell for years, and Kirsty must follow him to save her father and witness the power struggles among the newly damned.</p>
<p>The head of a psychiatric prison who meddles with a satanic puzzle cube unleashes a cabal of pain-seeking demons who terrorise his daughter. The girl must find a way to solve the puzzle and force the demons back to hell after a series of victims fall victim to the cube's power.</p>
<p>After having her father and perverse stepmother killed by the cenobites, Kirsty Cotton is sent to a psychiatric hospital. Even after trying to convince the authorities of what really happened with her family, nobody believes in her version of the history and they decide to place her in the institute, so that she rests and relaxes a little bit. The hospital is commanded by a brilliant and strange psychiatrist, Dr. Channard, who has been looking for the key for another dimension for a long time. The only person who believes in Kirsty is a young and kind assistant of Dr. Channard, called Kyle MacRae. Following Kirsty's version of the story, Channard put his hands on the bloodstained mattress where her stepmother Júlia died, Channard decides to resurrect her, killing his patients and offering them as food for Júlia. She returns without skin, and she decides to help Channard to bring the forces of the evil, but the plans of the two will be disturbed by Kirsty, who wants to end at once with the cenobites, and for Kyle, who doesn't want to see Kirsty being hurt...</p>
<p>Kirsty is brought to an institution after the death of her family, where the occult-obsessive head resurrects Julia and unleashes the Cenobites once again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After the sucess of the oringial Hellraiser , Clive Barker who has a name for himself passed on the diretcing duties to Tony Randel who made an impressive sequel in Hellbound: Hellraiser II . The film has more gore and a new heroine to help out Kristy Cotton. Once again Juila is back but this time she's totally hell bent and the film's primary villian. Pinhead is still scary but gets some compettion from Doc who is scary in his own right. I give the film *** out of ****.</p>
