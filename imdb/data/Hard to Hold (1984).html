<h1>Hard to Hold (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Details the efforts of a pop-rock star (James Roberts / Rick Springfield) to win the love of a woman he meets in a car accident. None of the usual gambits work on this woman, who has never heard of him. Complications arise involving the ex-girlfriend Nicky, who is still in his band. Lots of Springfield tunes help the plot along.</p>
<p>Rock star Jaime Roberts (Rick Springfield) is having a bad night. While trying to avoid his crazy ex-girlfriend, he locks himself out of his dressing room wearing only a towel, gets chased by a pack of rabid fans and has a car accident going back to his SF hotel. This is how he meets uptight child psychologist Diana Lawson. Sparks fly and Jaime is smitten. Will love win out over demanding careers and crazy exes? Great soundtrack by Rick Springfield and others.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The leading man, Rick Springfield did a good job with the lousy script he had to work with, but the casting could not have been worse for the leading lady. The actress (Janet Elliber) was ugly as dirt and looked about 15 years older than Rick, and there was nothing likable about her. She was supposed to be a mental health professional, yet she was extremely unbalanced and seemed to have a number of personality disorders. Patti Hansen gave a good performance as the jealous ex girl-friend, but her role wasn't developed enough to improve the film as a whole. Also, this movie came out before the PG-13 rating came along, so the editing is extremely choppy in places since the producers were trying to avoid an R rating. I think it definitely could have been better, and there are a few good scenes, particularly when Rick's character Jamie is performing on stage. Most of the music on the soundtrack was written and performed by Rick himself, and some of the songs like "Love Somebody" and "Don't Walk Away" are really memorable.</p>
