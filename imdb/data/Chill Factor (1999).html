<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A scientist develops a biological lethal weapon and accidentally kills eighteen soldiers in an island during the tests. Colonel Andrew Brynner is the commander and becomes the scapegoat of the incident. He is sentenced to go to the prison for ten years. Along this period, he becomes unbalanced and decides to get the bomb to sell to terrorists. He commands a group of mercenaries to steal the bomb from the base where Dr. Richard Long is researching. He shots the scientist but he flees with the weapon to the convenience store where the clerk Tim Mason and an ice-cream trucker driver Arlo are negotiating ice-creams. Mason receive this weapon from the injured Dr. Richard Long, with an advice to keep it below 50 F. they try to reach a military fort and try to escape from the colonel's team that is hunting them down.</p>
<p>Ten years after a covert military experiment on a remote Pacific island went wrong and killed eighteen servicemen and his assistant, Dr. Richard Long is still trying to forget the havoc that the experiment caused. Living in the small town of Jerome, Montana, Long still does scientific experiments at the local base, and he enjoys his time fly-fishing with Tim Mason, who works at a local diner. Long is visited by Colonel Andrew Brynner, a former military officer who took the blame and served ten years in Leavenworth Federal Prison for Long's experiment. Now a free man with a score to settle, Brynner has assembled a team of terrorists, including an icy blond named Vaughn. Brynner plans to steal and then sell "Elvis" -- Long's highly volatile, blue crystal substance -- to the highest international bidder. Unfortunately for him, Long, who gets killed, has already delivered "Elvis" to Mason, along with directions that the substance must remain below fifty degrees Fahrenheit, or it will detonate and vaporize everyone within several hundred miles of it. After Mason and Arlo, a wisecracking ice cream delivery man, have a run-in with Brynner, they try to get the substance to Fort Magruder. They don't exactly get along with each other -- Arlo only agrees to transport the substance in his ice cream truck because Mason held a gun on him -- but they find a common bond in trying to avoid Brynner, who will stop at nothing to get the substance.</p>
<p>Two mis-matched men, Arlo, an Ice Cream truck driver, and Tim a convenience store clerk, are forced to team up with each other, and get on each others nerves, when through a series of circumstances, they get possession of a top-secret, bio-warfare weapon, when heated to over 50 F, detonates and releases a lethal cloud of radioactivity in which a disgruntled, former U.S. Army officer and his team of alienated, former Army soldiers-turned-terrorists, want to use against the government for making them the scapegoats years earlier for their handling of the virus and covering up the existence of the weapon. With time running out, and the outdoor temperature rising, Arlo and Tim must outwit their pursuers and try to find a way to dispose of the weapon before they both become dead meat.</p>
<p>A new biological chemical weapon that explodes up to temperatures over fifty degrees Fahrenheit, falls into the hands of two men who try to make sure that it doesn't get stolen by a terrorist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cheesy, predictable plot, with no movement.  Stereotypical from beginning to end. The lighting and camera angles reminded me of something from a made for TV movie.  While the movie tried to be funny, it was far from it.</p>
