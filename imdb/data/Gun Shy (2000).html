<h1>Gun Shy (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An undercover DEA agent almost gets killed, and to continue with his mission he needs to attend group therapy.</p>
<p>On the outside, undercover DEA agent Charlie Mayheaux is cool, calm, in control; inside, he's nervous, fearful, flatulent. He's embedded in a double play to bring down a Colombian cartel and a New York City mob family, but his supervisor won't let him stage an arrest until huge sums of money are on the table. Everyone carries guns, and the NYC negotiator is a sociopath who shoots off the testicle of the cartel leader's lover. A psychiatrist sends Charlie to group therapy, and he starts dating the nurse who gives him an enema at a G.I. clinic. She advocates homeopathic remedies and looking on the bright side. With murder, showdowns, and back-stabbing, can there be a bright side?</p>
<p>An undercover DEA agent brings down the Mafia.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love Liam Neeson--I've seen nearly every movie he's ever been in. I'm curious about his life, and I buy the magazines he's featured in. But I NEVER, EVER needed to see him sitting on the toilet suffering with diarrhea. GROSS. Or passing gas. Or getting an enema. Or, for that matter, being weak and whiney. Nothing about his character in this movie is compelling, and it is a waste of his awesome talent. Also, he looks pale in this movie.Sandra Bullock plays the one imensional, wacky, unconventional sex kitten. The only interesting scenes are the opening ones, some of which reminded me of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. One positive thing: the music is good, especially the inclusion of Tom Waits music.Bottom line: Don't bother.</p>
