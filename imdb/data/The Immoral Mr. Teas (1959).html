<h1>The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mr. Teas is a door to door salesman for dentists' appliances. Everywhere he goes he encounters beautiful "well-developed" nude women, which of course stir his interest. The only sound in the film is the voice of a narrator and a very monotonic musical theme played on the clarinet or some similar instrument.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie contains some nude scenes, but there is no frontal nudity, because of the time it was made (1959) Although the film has no dialogue , only narration, it's nice to see the way early adult films had to adhere to the strict codes of the 50's. The movie is about a dental parts salesman, who can't help but notice the sexy women in the dentist's office, at the bar and at the beach. Throughout the movie he imagines them nude, and pictures them in suggesting poses. Every time he daydreams about these women nude, he snaps out of it and goes about daily life. The movie is a must see for movie buffs and those interested in history or the American pop-culture of the 50's.</p>
