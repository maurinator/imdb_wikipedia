<h1>A Little Night Music (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fredrik Egerman is very happy in his marriage to a seventeen-year-old virgin, Anne. Only she's been a virgin for the whole eleven months of the marriage, and being a bit restless, Fredrik goes to see an old flame, the famous actress Desiree Armfeldt. Desiree is getting tired of her life, and is thinkin of settling down, and sets her sights on Fredrik, despite his marriage, and her own married lover Count Carl-Magnus. She gets her mother to invite the Egermans to her country estate for the weekend. But when Carl-Magnus and his wife Charlotte appear, too, things begin to get farcical (Send in the Clowns), and the night must smile for the third time before all the lovers are united.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really wanted to like this film - the songs are fabulous, and, together with Follies and Company, it really is one of Sondheim's best musicals.  But this is a wasted opportunity.  The strongest overlapping trio (Now/Soon/Later) on stage sounds terrific, here it just doesn't work.  Other songs - particularly Liaisons and The Miller's Son - are missing.  It looks drab and empty.  But it does have its good points - Send in the Clowns is quite touching (it doesn't have to be sung - look at what Judi Dench and Elaine Stritch have done with it if you're not convinced) and Elizabeth Taylor is the perfect choice for Desiree.  It Would Have Been Wonderful works well and is by far the musical high point.  As some kind of record of the show, it is adequate, mildly satisfying, and passes the time.  But it certainly isn't great art and fails to engage any hint of interest in the characters.</p>
