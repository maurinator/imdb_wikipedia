<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this movie more than the first one. Don't know why. Maybe its because i saw it first.The movie takes off about a year(or nine months)after the first one. James and Mollie are married and Mollie is expecting her second child. Well the premise of the movie is pretty much simple; the institution of marriage thru the eyes of a Two year old. Actually there's more than that especially about Mikey owning up to the responsibility of having a little sister and his owning op to his own fear of Mr. Toilet man.James and Mollie have their second child, a baby girl named Julie but they share a volatile relationship. The movies portrays the effect of the friction and power-play between the couple on young Mikey. Mikey is not old enough to know the reason their parents fight, he just knows that they are yelling and assumes he has something to do with it or that his sister had something to do with it. This causes some love lost between the siblings, notably when mikey rips off the head of julies favorite doll. But common sense and love prevails and things work out well for all through testing circumstances. The Mr Toilet Man bit was funny. Mikeys Conversations with Eddie(voiced by damon Wayan)was the funniest part of the movie. Eddies giving potty tips to mikey was really great. Overall i think the movie could have been better if they had spent more time on the kids than about acoounting and the fighting.</p>
