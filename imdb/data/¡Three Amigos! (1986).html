<h1>¡Three Amigos! (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three out of work silent movie actors are accidentally drawn to a Mexican village that is being harassed by a gang of outlaws. The three, 'Ned', 'Lucky Day' and 'Dusty Bottoms' play 'Lone Ranger' types in their movies, but must play their parts for real now.</p>
<p>When silent film stars Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander get fired, they take a job offer from Mexico: Doing a show with El Guapo, supposedly the most famous actor there. Traveling there in hope of getting good money, they arrive only to learn soon that El Guapo is not an actor, but a cruel gang leader suppressing people. He abducts the mayor's beautiful daughter Carmen (to be his wife) in revenge for the people's cry for help. Now, all hopes of the village folks rest on the weak shoulders of three minor-talented actors, who can't just walk off the set this time.</p>
<p>Three actors accept an invitation to a Mexican village to perform their onscreen bandit fighter roles, unaware that it is the real thing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the level of humour you'll find throughout the movie.It's an ironic twist on the Western cliché with a story based on The Magnificent Seven.The recently out-of-work 3 Movie-Stars are unwittingly employed as bona-fide gun-slingers. They find themselves out-numbered 5:1 by the infamous ("More than Famous, He's In-Famous!"), El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his Banditos.This impossible situation is soon turned around by quick thinking (Girl A:"I like the one who is not so clever". Girl B:"Which one is that?") and lots of sewing... yes, I said "sewing"!If you listen to this movie closely, you'll pick-up on a lot of humour that would otherwise be lost.</p>
