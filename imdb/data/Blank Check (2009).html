<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I Never seen the 1994 Film Blank Check but I like the Nostalgic Critic's review which was Great. I liked Bland Sh*t 101 part which was funny. I liked this review a lot. The Movie is a 7 year-old boy named Preston wants Money and gets a Million dollar check and spends with. I liked the part where Doug was using a hammer to hit his balls which was funny. This Movie looks stupid and is kind of out dated now and its kind of a rip-off of "Home alone". Anyway Liked This review along Nostalgia Critic's review on the movie "North". I'm giving this review a 10 out 10 stars for being really funny and I really like the Nostalgia Critic in General. Anyway have a Nice Weekend. BYE.</p>
