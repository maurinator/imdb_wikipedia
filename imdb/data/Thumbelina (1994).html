<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I LOVE Thumbelina! My Mom taped it for me when I was little and I  would watch it every day. Now my niece does the same thing. I guess it runs in the family! A great movie for the family to sit down and watch together or kids to watch on their own. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT!</p>
