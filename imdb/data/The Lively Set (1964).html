<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Casey Owens (James Darren), a young mechanic, has developed a design for a turbine car engine, paving the way for a jet-powered auto certain to set a new land speed record. Wealthy playboy Stanford Rogers (Peter Mann) hires Casey to build the car for him to race in the Tri-State Endurance Run. Chuck Manning (Doug McClure), an engineering student Casey met in a drag race, discovers potential flaws in the car's design.

Pamela Tiffin plays Eadie, Chuck's sister who becomes Casey's love interest.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great old movie.  Loved it when it came out and still do.  Nice hot rods. Although some of the drag racing scenes appear to be 'sped up', the road racing scenes are really nice.</p>
