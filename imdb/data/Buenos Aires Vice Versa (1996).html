<h1>Buenos Aires Vice Versa (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is Buenos Aires, its characters, its history, its reality. A complex movie for a complex city, depicted in the character's language, and in their relationship with the present and the past. This is a story of contrasts, offered by a despair choir of characters: the old couple who hire a young woman to record city's present images, because they "don't get out much now", the boy who finds out the real story about his parents out of a coincidence... this and the others are all illustrations of actual Buenos Aires.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film describes Buenos Aires through different characters and situations in a perfect way. If this is reality, it´s a personal thing, but I think the visual effects and the looks of the character bring us an emotional picture of who we are. Although the music helps to get in touch with the script. I have only words of respect to this movie, and to Alejandro Agresti´s performance as the Director, Writer, Producer and his acting performance a blind person.</p>
