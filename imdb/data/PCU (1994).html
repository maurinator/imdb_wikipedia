<h1>PCU (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A high school senior comes to visit Port Chester (aka Politically Correct U) for the weekend, and the admissions department mistakenly sets him up to stay with Droz, a seven year student and party-animal who lives in The Pit, the most offensive house on campus. After trying to pawn the pre-freshman off on his house mate, Droz sets off on his normal daily activities including disrupting a political protest by throwing meat at a group of vegan protesters. The President of the University then receives a number of complaints, and with the help of her lackey, she may finally have the power to kick Droz's house off campus. But the Pit throws an all-campus rager where George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic performs, and everything might turn out alright if the various political groups can forget their protests for one night and just have fun together.</p>
<p>A high school senior visits college for the weekend, and stays at the wildest house on campus in this classic tale of anti-political-correctness.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A MOVIE TO WATCH IF YOU WANT TO LAUGHGutter and Droz will make you laugh and it doesn't need raunchy scenes to do it. It is just in your face funny. There are a very good number of positive postings about this movie so I know the DVD release is because this is a cult classic, and it will become a much bigger one if more people actually knew about the movie. I only believe that there has been one college movie released before or after PCU that compares to it and that is Old School.As far as Animal House goes don't get me wrong, awesome movie. But it is overrated because it was the trend setter in this kind of movie which in my opinion doesn't make a movie great.I have little faith in the DVD having great behind the scenes or deleted scenes but if it has one cool thing on it i think it is worth it.F- this 5.8 rank. I find it funny that according to the poll's description men over 45 give the movie an average of a 3.8 vote which is by far the worst. WTF, I don't watch movies in the 70's that i don't understand and give them a rank of 1/10. So, F- these people that bash what they don't and can't understand. So if you have seen it and love it vote and help up the rank so more people have more of an incentive to watch this great movie.-ding ding ding, Gutter tell her what she's won :)</p>
