<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i stumbled across this film late one Saturday night on sky and decided to watch it. i found it to be so rubbish that i loved it. its a typical z rate movie with jokes that are so rubbish they are funny. the hero Rex is supposed to be 18 years old or so and I'm sure the actor playing him is about 40!!!! i would ignore all the rubbishing comments and watch it. it should be a cult film :))) Eba is beautiful and the cave men try to be funny, most people probably wont laugh but i found them class especially the chief and the woman with black scraggy hair. the acting is absolute 3rd rate the dialogue is so rubbish it makes for essential viewing. don't take my word for it though find out for yourself by watching it :)</p>
