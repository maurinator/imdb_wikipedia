<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Small-time crook Harry Bundage discovers that the old manor house where Lady St. Edmund resides, with three orphans and her butler Priory is the resting place for a hoard of treasure. Unfortunately, he doesn't know where it is. Bundage recruits urchin Casey Brown to dupe Lady St. Edmund into thinking that she is her long-lost granddaughter, so she can search for clues to the location of the treasure. Unbeknownst to Bundage AND her ladyship, Lady St. Edmund is flat broke, and Priory and the children help her ladyship try to keep her home and pride. Joined by Casey, they do all the chores and Priory acts as the butler, gardener, chauffeur and an old major all at the same time!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another Disney classic, a definite for young children and a movie I would recommend for families.The country setting helps this film along as it reinforces the atmosphere being an "old" age film, set in the past, but not to far back. The acting by Jodie Foster in this film is delightful to watch as the tomboy clich√© is used but to great effect. Another brilliant performance is by David Niven, the butler, but who undergoes changes in his personality to acquire different identities as to accompany his mistress in disguise, giving her a sense of many friendships.Any fight scenes are classically in Disney fashion, amusing and inventive defences and preceding this, even a car chase magnificently manoeuvred by Mr. Prairy the butler (Niven)and much to any child's delight.A film guaranteed to be loved by young children and even appreciated by the open-minded of older years but without a doubt, a family film enjoyed by all the family, including the grandparents!!</p>
