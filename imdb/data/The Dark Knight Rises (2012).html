<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I knew right from the opening shot of Gordon's eulogy "I knew Harvey Dent..." with the breaking to form the Bat symbol, that this was going to be epic. It was obvious from the beginning that the film legend. In fact, I loved it and I think it is the best movies The Dark Knight. I absolutely Loved it, and I'm glad they really humanized Batman and limited his screen time in this film. Some "comic booky-actiony" type fans didn't like the small amount of time we actually see Batman, but that was the whole point of the trilogy! The ending, where Foley says "there's only one police in this town" while doing their march against Bane was really awesome. The ending was perfect. But the movie has missed the Joker. I say as both a Batman fanboy and especially a Nolan fanboy that this is the perfect trilogy.</p>
