<h1>Droopy (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Despite what's printed on the credits, Tex Avery had nothing to do with this cartoon - it's a Cinemascope remake of 'Wags to Riches' (1949), put together by others from his original artwork and production cels. Apart from the new Cinemascope backgrounds, it's identical to the earlier film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the same cartoon as "Wags To Riches," which was distributed in 1949. I am even surprised that the folks who put out this tremendous DVD collection of Tex Avery Droopy cartoons would even add to the package, knowing it's the same cartoon we saw on the other disc in this two-disc set. In fact, as IMDb points out, Avery had nothing to do with this one. Why should he? It's the EXACT same story!"Wags To Riches" was one of the more popular Droopy cartoons ever made, even to this day, so perhaps that's why it was re-shown in a different format to a new set a kids seven years later. This "cinemascope" was a big deal in the mid-1950s." It was something brand new as movies always had that box-shaped screens.I did not rate this any stars as it is literally a repeat.</p>
