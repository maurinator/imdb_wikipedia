<h1>Bellman and True (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hiller, a computer expert, was bribed by group of bank robbers to obtain details of the security system at a newly-built bank. Having obtained the information, he thought he'd seen the last of the robbers. But now they've traced him and his son to London. They hold the son hostage and force Hiller to decode the information about the alarm and then to take part in the robbery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a surprise for me, since I bought it for 99 cents at the local supermarket's video sale.  Bernard Hill gives a fantastic performance, and the suspense was unbearable.  The heist is great, as is the direction.  I cannot believe I have never heard of this before, but I sure will recommend it to anyone who likes crime, computer, and English films.</p>
