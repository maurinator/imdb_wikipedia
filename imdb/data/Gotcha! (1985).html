<h2> Summaries </h2>

After a big win, he goes off for a vacation in France where he meets the sexy Sasha who says she is only interested in him because he is a virgin. She takes him with her to East Germany where they are separated and he has to escape back to the west on his own, all the while being trailed by East German spies. He arrives home only to find the game is still going on, and a canister of film is in his backpack. Then Sasha re-appears.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In college Jonathan plays Gotcha with a paintball gun, but when his trip to Europe takes a turn with the KGB, he swaps he toy gun for the real thing. This is my No.1 favourite film of all time. I acknowledge that the film has its problems in the script department and also the many plausablities that make you go "Dah?". BUUUUT this film has such a rapid line of gags and dialogue that it can take you back to films such as "The big sleep".The one liners come thick and fast, as does the action in which our Yankee hero Anthony Edwards teams up with Russian spy Linda Fiorento to run away from (the then popular enemy) the KGB. Anthony Edwards:"Wirgins? you mean virgins! No I'm not a virgin!" Linda Fiorento:"I like wirgins" Anthony:"Yes I'm a Wirgin"</p>
