<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Though fans of European cinema are most likely to remember the erotic art films of Walerian Borowczyk, "Blanche" purposely avoids explicit sexuality. In fact, the film is a tragic tale of love and lust sans the nudity and sex.(The only nude scene takes place at the very beginning when Blanche is getting out of her bath.) The plot concerns the Blanche, the young wife of a much older lord, and the tragedy that is the offspring of 4 men's love for her. Her stepson (a very handsome young man) is pure of heart and is madly in love with her. When he expresses his feelings toward her, she refuses to return them out of loyalty to her husband. Thus, Blanche is a very naive and dedicated woman. However, when the king and his page arrive Blanche is faced with their affections for her...The story avoids the clich√© "happily ever after" ending. In fact, the only survivor in the whole tale is the king. What begins as a light and airy tale ends on a bleak note. Fans of Borowczyk or European cinema in general should look this film up. It isn't a very fast paced or action filled tale, but the story is very well structured and effective. It is a shame that films aren't made in this vein anymore.</p>
