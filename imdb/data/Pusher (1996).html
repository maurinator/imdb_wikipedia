<h1>Pusher (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frank is a drug pusher on the roll until he makes a huge deal with dope that he hasn't paid for and he gets busted by the police. He manages to dump the dope in a nearby lake but he owes his supplier a lot of money (not a nice guy to owe money to). Now we follow Frank in his quest to raise money in the underworld of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>A drug pusher grows increasingly desperate after a botched deal leaves him with a large debt to a ruthless drug lord.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pusher is a movie you either love or hate. I'm among those who love it. I especially like the fast cuts between scenes, the camera movements and that the foreign language in the movie hasn't been translated. That gives you a feeling of being there... you're able to feel how the main character must feel in the situations where he's surrounded by the drug dealers. He can't understand what they're saying and must rely on his intuition and their body language - and so is the viewer!The movie is rather brutal, but it seems natural when you're watching it. It's a different movie, but it has a story to tell and it succeeds. And then there's the end.... an open ending, but somehow you know that Frank doesn't really have many oportunities. You feel sympathy for Frank even though he's actually a criminal.</p>
