<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd team up in a story where happily married Libby Parsons (Judd) finds her financial-troubled husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) missing. An investigation leads to the conviction of Libby for murdering Nick to obtain the insurance policy he had. While in prison, Libby learns Nick is still alive and had framed her. Therefore, after being paroled she escapes probation officer Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) to look for Nick, with Travis hot on her trail.This movie combines the tension of Judd's "Kiss The Girls" and Jones' "The Fugitive" to provide a movie that is double the mystery and suspense, captivating an audience and keeping the movie's momentum strong. The tension builds in one scene after the other to its action-packed climax, from the moment Libby finds her husband missing to her struggling to cope in prison, and to her avoiding her probation officer to her attempting to track down her husband.Movie may be a little predictable, and some of the plot elements are the same as the TV movie "Bitter Vengeance," which stars Bruce Greenwood playing a character that also escapes, fakes his murder, and frames his wife. But overall, this is another nice popcorn movie for a night.Grade B-</p>
