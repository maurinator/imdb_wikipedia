<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>of all the sentiments tried and tested in Indian movies, the mother-son relationship is the most cherished and sacred...some movies have done wonders with it, some not that much and some are too cheesy and in-the- face that it disgraces one of mankind's dearest sentiments... and then there is Nandha - one that is so true and grim that you wish it never happens in real life...we dread the path the film takes and bala makes sure that our worst fears come true, and more...Rajkiran's role in this movie is any character actor's dream - a well etched out role with wonderful camaraderie moments and neat, powerful dialog. Bala's movies have some wonderful acting pieces in it, Nandha is no exception. Its the role that made Surya what he is today, no doubt. With captivating body language and demeanor he delivers with remarkable restraint and sincerity...the only aberration is his lens. Now, why in the world did Bala use a revolting blue eye shade for Surya ? Surya's normal eyes are themselves very expressive and piercing , negative marks for the otherwise near-perfect director. if Mani Rathnam, Balachander and others were thought of as being masters of human relationships, in walks Bala - shaking that credibility and leaving behind a mark that he can truly claim to be his own. Such easy flowing screenplay with an eclectic choice of current political subjects, this movie is a gross deviation from its contemporaries, and thankfully so.very few, and i mean really very few films can claim to stun the audience with an intrepid, bold ending note and Nandha ends with a particularly loud bang, leaving us all spellbound causing us to contemplate our own beliefs and aspirations...hats off Bala sir !!</p>
