<h1>Loophole (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A bank teller attempts to clear his name and rebuild his career after he is wrongly accused of theft.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>LOOPHOLE avoids being routine through the strength of its casting and some interesting characters. Barry Sullivan is very good as a bank teller victimized in a brazen robbery scheme: he is responsible for nearly $50,000 that goes missing. As his wife, Dorothy Malone looks terrific and adds an enjoyable smartness to what could have been a humdrum role. Most interesting of all is Charles McGraw as the tenacious insurance investigator, Gus Slavin. He is convinced Sullivan is faking innocence and biding his time. McGraw has several enjoyable opportunities to harrass Sullivan, and he also sabotages the poor teller's attempts to get on with his life.Like most B movies, LOOPHOLE makes use of improbable coincidence. But we don't mind it so much when they involve the likes of Don Beddoe and the nicely played femme fatale of Mary Beth Hughes. There are also many interesting LA locations to be seen in the film.Well worth a look, particularly for noir enthusiasts.</p>
