<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young man, morally destroyed by his parents not loving him and by the fear of being not capable to make his girlfriend happy, rises on the ledge of a building with the intention of committing suicide. A policeman makes every effort to argue him out of that.</p>
<p>While on patrol on Lower Manhattan on St. Patrick's Day, traffic cop Charlie Dunnigan spots a potential suicide on a ledge of a Broadway hotel. Because the young man vocalizes his dislike for the police, Dunnigan alters his uniform and establishes a rapport with him. When the police rescue squad arrives, Dunnigan returns to his street duties. Authorities identify the jumper as Robert Cosick but are unable to win his trust or discover the reason for his actions. Cosick demands that Dunnigan return as the swelling crowd and cynical reporters create a media circus in the streets. As the day wears on, psychiatrists, Cosick's dysfunctional parents, and his ex-fiancee all try to talk him off the ledge without success as the day gives way to an eerie night illuminated by floodlights.</p>
<p>An unhappy man threatens suicide by standing on the ledge of a high-rise building for 14 hours.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I came across this film while changing channels.  What stopped me was seeing such a young Richard Basehart.  What kept me was the tense story.  Most of it was confined to the building ledge and the room behind it.  The background film was extraordinary. I think I've been able to pinpoint within 2 blocks where on Broadway  this hotel was supposed to be.  Another thing was the cast.It seemed like they hadn't gone for "stars", just good actors. Ossie Davis, Jeffrey Hunter, Howard Da Silva (before the black- list), and Grace Kelly in her first film. I wish I could see it from the beginning.</p>
