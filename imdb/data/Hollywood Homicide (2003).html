<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After seeing 40 Days and 40 Nights I was seriously beginning to doubt Hartnett's acting ability. This movie certainly proved me wrong. He and Ford worked supurbly together. The one liners and witty quips were abundant, yet done in such a way that I wasn't bombarded. All around a great film, where else can you see Ford riding a pink bicycle or Hartnett doing yoga?This one is definately a must see. The car is pretty snazzy too!</p>
