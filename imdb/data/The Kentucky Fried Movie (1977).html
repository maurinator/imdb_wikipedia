<h1>The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Madcap spoof, a collection of comedy skits includes the Kung-Fu parody, "A Fistful Of Yen" and "Catholic School Girls In Trouble." Enjoy the future of movie-going with the "Feel-A-Round" theater experience. See a notable and highly respected actor as the clumsiest waiter in motion picture history. Watch such character as Cleopatra Schwartz and Big Jim Slade tickle your funny bone until it has to be removed surgically!</p>
<p>A series of short, highly irreverent, and often tasteless skits.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Though this movie has absolutely nothing to it, its considered a great movie on my part.Not only did this movie make me burst a gut, but its a great satire of, well, everything. It's the remedy to any tear-jerker and also a great movie to watch when there's, "just nothing on that night", sit through it, have some laughs, and enjoy it. There's nothing better to it.Of course, the main skit, "A fistful of yen" was absolute genius. The moves, and the way they were all made, was absolute prodegetic. I praise David and Jerry Zucker for this, and again, John Landis continues to make great movies. This, for one, is probably in his best other than "Animal House" and "The Blues Brothers".Serve up the chicken, because this movie is going to eat your heart out!</p>
