<h1>Goya in Bordeaux (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Francisco Goya (1746-1828), deaf and ill, lives the last years of his life in voluntary exile in Bordeaux, a Liberal protesting the oppressive rule of Ferdinand VII. He's living with his much younger wife Leocadia and their daughter Rosario. He continues to paint at night, and in flashbacks stirred by conversations with his daughter, by awful headaches, and by the befuddlement of age, he relives key times in his life, particularly his relationship with the Duchess of Alba, his discovery of how he wanted to paint (insight provided by Vel√°zquez's work), and his lifelong celebration of the imagination. Throughout, his reveries become tableaux of his paintings.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Greenaway was the first to show us that film could be "moving painting" (as opposed to moving photography). The life of Goya is reflected to the screen through his paintings and it is very beautifully done.Saura is very careful to stress the "artistic" side of Goya's personality and all his love affairs, political views are secondary to it. You can get a clear picture of what kind of a painter this spanish was. A little too formalistic maybe...Good job anyway. Pleasure for the eyes..</p>
