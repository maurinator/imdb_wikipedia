<h1>Blazing Saddles (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Ultimate Western Spoof. A town where everyone seems to be named Johnson is in the way of the railroad. In order to grab their land, Hedley Lemar (Harvey Korman(R.I.P.)), a politically connected nasty person, sends in his henchmen to make the town unlivable. After the sheriff is killed, the town demands a new sheriff from the Governor (Mel Brooks). Hedley convinces him to send the town the first Black sheriff (Cleavon Little(R.I.P.)) in the west. Bart is a sophisticated urbanite who will have some difficulty winning over the townspeople.</p>
<p>In this raucous parody of the Western film genre, greedy land developer, Hedley Lamarr ('Harvey Korman'(RIP)) greases palms of insane Earl Long/Blaze-type governor ('Mel Brooks') to induce his help to snatch land to build Hedley's railroad. A key piece of land, Rock Ridge, is inhabited by a flock of Johnsons, all deeply entrenched in the town. The governor tries to help Hedley rid himself of the townspeople; first, he appoints black sheriff Bart (Cleavon Little(RIP)) for Rock Ridge. Next, Hedley sics Lili von Shtupp ('Madeline Kahn'(RIP)), "Teutonic Twit" on Bart. With the help of his sidekick, The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart fights for his new town. But, the politicos (and the WB studio) fight back.</p>
<p>To ruin a western town, a corrupt political boss appoints a black sheriff, who promptly becomes his most formidable adversary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Mel Brooks, but from cinema itself.  Film stars Cleavon Little as a regular black laborer, but then a villain (Heldey Lamarr is perfectly played by Harvey Korman) wants to move a community out of the town Rockridge.  So, he brings Cleavon in to make the people leave (the people in town are racist including the line: "The sherrif is a nig!  "What'd he say?"  "He said the sherrif's a near).  Funny story, funny jokes (the farting sequence is ahead of it's time for 1974) and 2 breakthroughs- Madedline Kahn in a Oscar nominated performance as Von Shtupp and shines through.  The other is Richard Pryor, who co-writes the script with Brooks and Andrew Bergman.  Hilarious, forever.  A+</p>
