<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's hard to believe the low rating and lack of reviews for this gem of a medical series. These breezy half-hours were by turns funny, tragic, romantic, shocking and stimulating.The series followed a group of young doctors, male and female, just out of school and beginning their first practical stint in a hospital. All the characters were likable and well-played. One or two initially verged on stereotypes, but as the show progressed, all were fleshed out to a point that this was no longer an issue. Various relationships developed within the group, which, unfortunately, were not given a chance to fully resolve themselves within the two seasons of the run.The format was reminiscent of another half-hour medical series: M*A*S*H. Each episode consisted of one larger story arc, that often turned out to have a trivial or ironic outcome, plus a bunch of interwoven lesser arcs, that had each of the characters facing some new challenge in their work. Each of these stories was beautifully crafted, with strong emotions and an eye for off-beat personalities and peculiar situations.One reason for the low rating might be that the series began on a downbeat note. Anyone expecting a light-hearted comedy would certainly have been challenged by this early twist. But again, the parallel to M*A*S*H holds up: that series also had its unexpected moments of tragedy, albeit not right at the start (nor so believably handled). The title also probably didn't help. There seemed to be a glut of movies and series about this time, all using the name 'Crash' or some variation on it.I guess it's too late to hope for more episodes of this particular Crash. But I highly recommend tracking down the wonderful dozen that do exist.</p>
