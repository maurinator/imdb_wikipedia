<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A ruthless crook abducts the wife and child of a bank manager and then masquerades as an insurance company detective while scheming to rob the institution in this crime drama. Unfortunately, some of the manager's employees learn about the plot and the terrified manager must beg them to remain silent. Fortunately, the cops have been on the case all along.</p>
<p>It's December 23rd, and the staff at the small Haversham Branch of the City & Colonial Bank are preparing for their Christmas party tonight. One person who won't be attending is Harry Fordyce, the fifteen year branch manager, a stern, humorless, by-the-books man who does not associate with his subordinates and who will not allow his staff to adorn the branch with any Christmas related items. Rather than authorize the requested transfer by his head clerk Pearson to another branch, Fordyce is thinking about firing him for a £10 discrepancy which Pearson authorized but which was cleared up before Fordyce saw the error. If fired, Pearson would never be able to get another position at another bank. That morning as the branch opens, they receive an unexpected visit by Colonel Gore Hepburn, who represents the bank's insurance company, he who is doing a surprise inspection. What Fordyce alone learns early in Hepburn's visit is that he is not who he says he is, but rather a robber who has a detailed plan to rob the branch of £90,000. The plot entails Hepburn spending exactly 45 minutes at the branch, and a further one hour getaway during which time Fordyce is not to tell anyone, including the police, of the robbery. Hepburn has Fordyce's wife and son as hostages at his home to get him to go along with the plot. As the morning wears on and as Fordyce follows Hepburn's unbending instructions "or else", Fordyce may have some issue carrying out those instructions because of the strained relationship he has with his staff.</p>
<p>A charming but ruthless criminal holds the family of a bank manager hostage as part of a cold-blooded plan to steal 97,000 pounds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was going to give this film an 8, but when I thought about how inexpensively and expertly the movie was made, I really think it deserves a 9. This is a great case of a relatively simple plot made a whole lot better by wonderful acting and direction. In particular, André Morell plays a deliciously evil yet complex villain and Peter Cushing gives what is probably his best performance in his long career. As a result, it's well worth seeing--and a great example for film makers, as it proves you don't need a huge budget and complex sets to make a good film.The film is set in a bank. The manager (Cushing) is a humorless and exacting boss--very efficient but not one to inspire his employees' love or devotion. However you dislike the guy, though, you can't help but feel for him with what happens next. A guy who purports to be from the underwriter for the bank arrives and asks to meet with Cushing alone. The man (Morell) then announces that he is, in fact, a bank robber and that if Cushing does not cooperate, Cushing's wife and son will be tortured or killed. And, he provides a phone message with the scared wife to prove that he means business. What will happen next? Cushing IS a very efficient man, but he loves his family and can't let them be hurt.Throughout the film, I marveled at Cushing. The actor was known mostly for his horror films, but he appeared in gobs of movies--but never one that allowed him such an opportunity to emote like this. Cushing is very, very convincing as a scared and lonely man who feels trapped. It's too bad that many of his other roles were a bit one-dimensional and didn't let him demonstrate he was a heck of an actor. Morell is also quite good--but his smooth criminal doesn't provide him quite the same depth and opportunity as Cushing's. This is Cushing's film.An exciting plot, wonderfully written characters and great acting--what more could you ask for in a crime film?! See this one.</p>
