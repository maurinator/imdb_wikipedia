<h1>Sweet Movie (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The intercut story of two women: a nearly-mute beauty queen who descends into withdrawal and madness, and another who captains a ship laden with candy and sugar, luring men and boys aboard for sex, death, and revolutionary talk. The beauty queen passes from a wealthy husband whose honeymoon delight is to urinate on her, to a muscular keeper who punches her, stows her in a suitcase, and ships her to Paris, to a lip-synching rock idol with whom she has a love spasm, to an Austrian commune complete with a banquet of vomit, urine, feces, chopped dildos, and wet nurses. By then she's in a fetal position, until everyone's rescued by reminders that "it's just a movie."</p>
<p>In the contest of the "most virgin" Miss Monde 1984, Miss Canada wins, and prize is the marriage with the milk industry tycoon with his fifty billion dollars fortune. In their honeymoon, Miss Canada "does not accept" the golden penis of her husband, and with the support of the black man Jeremiah Muscle, she runaways to Paris. There she meets a Latin singer, El Macho, they have an intercourse in Eiffel Tour and they get stuck together. She moves to a weird anarchic community and later she becomes an actress working in a chocolate advertisement. Meanwhile, the revolutionary, pedophile, and mad killer Anna Planeta makes candy in her boat while sailing through the canals of a city that seems to be Amsterdam. She meets the sailor Potemkin and they have a torrid affair. Meanwhile she uses her candies to seduce young boys and kill her lovers. In the middle of the story, it is presented what seem to be footages of a Nazi doctor and a slaughter in a war with many dead bodies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sweet Movie is a brilliantly absurdist expose about ideological imprisonment and innocence lost. OK, that sentence might sound absurd itself, but let's put it this way. Makavejev has created a brave, brave film. It communicates very engaging thoughts without spoon-feeding us. It does this visually and relies on the experiences and intelligence of the audience to make of it what they will. Montage is used in a smart way. Collages are created with the mis-en-scene. Hilarious juxtaposition, vibrant colors and detailed textures are constant. The music is underground and reoccurs in natural points in the. And politically speaking, it's an incredibly brave and isolated film that accuses the soviets of a crime they had long since denied at the time. Sweet Movie is NOT a snuff film. It is NOT a cult film. Those adjectives water down this intelligent avant-garde film. This is film is nothing like the films of John Waters. Plus, I would like to criticize some of the harsh critics of this movie. Many dislike the film because of the brutal scene in the commune where the members vomit and spit amongst other things. And this film was banned in London because of the scene where the young boys are seduced on the boat traveling through Amsterdam canals. I find it peculiar that those are the scenes that would disturb you, when there is an gut-wrenching intercut scene of raw footage revealing the aftermath of heinous massacres where bodies have been burned to a crisp and shoved in the ground. It's an example of how society finds sex and bodily functions more disturbing than the savagery of genocide.</p>
