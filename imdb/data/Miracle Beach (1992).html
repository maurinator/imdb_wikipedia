<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First time I saw Miracle Beach, Ami Dolenz just blew me away., I thought she made the whole movie. You had the life friends that partied all the time, the homeless gent who is talented if he is given work. Parts of this movie, if you have dreams or wishes, you never know what can happen.. I think the movie is one of the better movies I have seen in a comedy type movie.Stereotyping was very prevalent in the movie from the stud volleyball players to the fashion models.Soup, Lars and Scotty believe in the theory genies are real, but needed a bit of convincing. Scotty was the Master, but for the most part didn't let most of his power go to his head. He helped people that were less fortunate than him, and by doing so, his idea of what a truly good woman in changes..</p>
