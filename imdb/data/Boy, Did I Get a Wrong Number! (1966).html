<h2> Summaries </h2>

While she is staying in a hotel, the operator accidentally connects her with a real estate agent named Tom Meade. She asks Tom to bring her some food and when he does he suggests that she go to his cabin in the woods. She also asks him not to tell anyone where she is because she doesn't want to go back to Hollywood. Now Tom must keep the secret, especially from his wife and from his suspicious housekeeper Millie.</p>
<p>A seductive starlet flees Hollywood and causes chaos for a real estate agent.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. What strikes me about this flick is that I watched it with not only my parents (early 60s) but also my three sisters and two brothers, whose ages range from late 30s to early 40s, and we were all howling with laughter over it.It is one of those campy movies that it so chock full of clever innuendos and suggestive 'adult material' but is so witty in its presentation.In my opinion, Bob Hope & Phyllis Diller were destined to work together. Phyllis Diller's witty and barbed remarks traded with her "boss" Bob Hope were just too outrageous: ...Doorbell rings: Bob Hope: Wasn't that the doorbell? Phyllis:  Could be...it had a familiar ring to it. Bob Hope: Aren't you going to answer it? Phyllis:  Me?Bob Hope berates her for her laziness as a Maid and Phyllis answers the bell and rejoins him in the kitchen, where she resumes sipping her coffee.Phyllis:  Two boys to see you, Master. Bob Hope: Didn't they say who they were? Phyllis:  Look, I answered the door didn't I? Bob Hope: Yes, but you didn't keep on GOING!Loved this sweet film!!!</p>
