<h1>Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The despicable Ramon Cota has murdered an innocent father and child and is exporting illegal drugs into the USA. When Colonel Scott McCoy from the original film, and his sworn partner attempt to bring him to court, their efforts are all in vain, as he is let off virtually Scott free. Unable to contain his rage, Scott's buddy furiously lashes out at him in court, to Cota's anger. He exacts the same ritual on his wife and child as he did on the previous Father and kid. Out on a personal mission of vengeance, the buddy finds himself mercilessly killed at Cota's hands. When an arsenal of soldiers attempt to go in and bring Cota and his army down, they are taken hostage, surely to be executed soon. McCoy leads a brigade of skydiving commandos in, along with himself, to rescue the hostages and exact violent revenge upon Cota.</p>
<p>When DEA agents are taken captive by a ruthless South American kingpin, the Delta Force is reunited to rescue them in this sequel to the 1986 film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Follow-up to ¨Deltaforce I¨ which based on the real-life hijacking of TWA Flight 847 on 14 June 1985 with Norris shinning ,resulting to be one of the best roles he'd made to date and here again Delta Force commanded by Chuck is called into service to eliminate all elusive drug lords and smugglers on the Colombian jungle . Delta leader/Norris leads the brigade into Latin America to snuff out a nasty drug baron and being starred by Chuck Norris , Richard Jaeckel, John P Ryan , Begonya Plaza , Mark Margolis , Billy Drago and directed by his brother Aaron Norris . As DEA and authorities don't negotiate with dope ringleaders , they blow them away! , as an America's special squadron led by Col. Scott McCoy along with his underlings take on mean villains .Standard action-packed picture , plenty of blow-up , derring-do and fast moving . The film has frenetic action , shoot'em up and spectacular set pieces and for that reason is fun . This is a straight-forward Action|Adventure|Drama|Thriller|War movie . It is tense and exciting , at time bemusing and in average budget . Uneven picture , however being entertaining , amusing and never tiring . Exciting rescue climax but realized in cartoon style , to say the least , with spectacular but silly action scenes . There five crew members were killed in a helicopter accident during filming , the film is dedicated in their memory . The film was originally to be produced with the cooperation of Delta Force's real-life founder and original commanding officer, Col. Charles Beckwith . This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the veteran Delta, as he's fine as tough, cold, stubborn Colonel . It's a predictable, shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some acceptable action sequences . Michael Dudikoff and Steve James were attached to the project when it was known as Spitfire: Delta Force II . After they passed on it, Chuck Norris was given the script which he disliked and was changed into the final product . Nice acting by Billy Drago , he steals the show as a sadomasochist villainous . He is is a reference to Pablo Escobar, a similar flamboyant real-life Columbian drug dealer who also had such an entrance to his compound . Atmospheric and functional cinematography by Joao Fernándes filmed in Tennessee and Philippines . Cota's mansion seen in the movie is the real-life Palac located in Tagaytay City outside Manila, it was erected by former First Lady Imelda Marcos . Commercial and catching musical score composed by means of synthesizer by Frederic Talgorn including lively leitmotif . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Aaron Norris , though Michael Winner was going to direct, but Chuck Norris didn't like the script. Aaron has usually produced , playing stunts and directed various vehicles for his brother Chuck , such as ¨Missing in action 3¨ , ¨Hitman¨ , ¨Hellbound¨, some episodes of ¨Walker Texas Ranger¨and three children films such as ¨Sidekicks¨ , ¨Top dog¨ and this ¨Forest warrior¨. The only film done by Aaron Norris to not have Chuck Norris in it was ¨Platoon leader¨. This a a sequel to ¨Delta Force I¨ that dealt with a a hijacking TWA plane and starred by an all-star-cast as Chuck Norris , Lee Marvin , George Kennedy , being professionally produced and directed by Menahen Golan from Cannon Productions along with Yoran Globus . It is followed by several sequels in comic-book similar style ; as it posteriorly continues with this ¨Delta Force II operation stranglehold or Colombian connection ¨ , ¨Delta Force III the killing game¨ with the sons Hollywood's bigger stars : Eric Douglas , Nick Cassavetes , Mike Norris and directed by Sam Firstemberg ; ¨Delta Force : operation Ebola ¨ (1997) by Sam Firstemberg with Joe Lara , Jeff Fahey , Ernie Hudson , Frank Zagarino, Rob Stewart , Natasha Sutherland and many others . Furthermore , ¨Delta Force one : The lost patrol¨ by Joseph Zito with Gary Daniels , Mike Norris and Bentley Mitchum , ¨Operation Delta Force 2 Mayday¨ with Michael McGrady and directed by Yossi Wein , ¨Operation Delta Force 3: Clear Target¨ by Mark Roper with Jim Fitzpatrick , Bryan Genesse and Greg Collins ; plus ¨Operation Delta Force 4 : Deep Fault¨ with Gary Hudson , Johnny Messner , Greg Collins and Joe Lara , among others .</p>
