<h1>Medium Cool (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Cassellis is the toughest TV-news reporter around. His area of interest is reporting about violence in the ghetto and racial tensions. But he discovers that his network helps the FBI by letting it look at his tapes to find suspects. When he protests, he is fired and goes to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p>1968. Cameraman John Cassellis and his sound man Gus work for WHJP-TV news Chicago, channel 8 on the dial. John has to walk a fine line in his work, especially in this day and age of increasing public disenfranchisement due to anti-establishment feelings, with frequent civil rights protests, anti-war protests or other civil unrest taking place. In what are already confrontational situations, John and Gus' involvement adds yet another layer of possible confrontation. Although by the very nature of their work they are supposed to be neutral in the situation, they also have to decide when not to be neutral, in when it is more appropriate to be involved for the greater good of those in the situation. It is in one such of these moral questions that John comes to loggerheads with his superiors. At this time, John also puts aside his largely "sexually free" casual relationship with a nurse named Ruth to begin a more serious relationship with Eileen Horton, a recent arrival to Chicago from rural West Virginia. Their relationship is despite what could have been their very antagonistic initial meeting over an issue concerning her thirteen year old son, Harold, who largely has a mind of his own. Two concurrent items - John filming the 1968 Democratic National Convention and Harold going missing - bring the professional issues in John's life to a head in a global sense.</p>
<p>A TV news reporter finds himself becoming personally involved in the violence that erupts around the 1968 Democratic National Convention.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Interesting approach to revealing the world of photo-journalism, news journalism, and political activism, conceived and directed by awardÂ–winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Fictional narrative features a Chicago TV news crew intertwined with actual news footage in and around the Democratic Convention of 1968.There is a good balance between the fiction and non-fiction elements in as much as Wexler attempts to make his point. The fictional story line (a love story) is real enough to keep us watching and deflective enough to make the harsh realities of the non-fiction elements palatable.Attention to detail defines Medium Cool as a very personal film for Wexler. There definitely is a political perspective. Second and third viewings will call attention to painstaking perfectionism in construction of shots, timing, and pace--the subject matter and cinematic approach (low budget, hand-held, docu-style) may suggest a `student film' so don't be confused. This is an extremely well-crafted highly professional product. Nice interjects of great era-defining music compliment the visuals.Inventive, some say ground-breaking, certainly well worth watching.</p>
