<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of cinema's greatest achievements.  The film is an incredible experience.  The fact that you spend almost two hours watching the figure of someone buried under sheets and that we are intrigued by every second of it, testifies to the genius of the film.  It's sad that most people remember this movie as the one Metallica made a video for.  No offense to the band, but this JGHG is far more important than that.  Dalton Trumbo's only directorial effort and it is flawless.  The majority of the film is told in a voiceover and like "Twelve Angry Men" every thing takes place in one room. Prepare to be amazed.</p>
