<h1>Emmanuelle (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Emmanuelle is a beautiful young model and lives in Bangkok together with her husband Jean, who's several years older. She likes him because he's taught her much, and he likes her because she's learning so well - and wants to often. Both are very tolerant in matters of extramarital affairs, so he doesn't mind the young Marie-Ange coming over every so often, although she obviously wants more than talk from his wife. But Emmanuelle is more fascinated by the older Bee, and joins her on a trip into the jungle.</p>
<p>The wife of a French diplomat in Bangkok, Emmanuelle embarks on a voyage of sexual discovery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Emmanuelle" is an elegant, excellently photographed movie, but too often rolls in a syrupy pretension It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in Bangkok There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic places There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemaking The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophy There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinemaMy favorite moment when teen-ager Christine Boisson comes upon the nude Sylvia Kristel asleep Without embarrassment, she leans forward and unusually caresses gently and affectionately Emmanuelle's breast with her finger</p>
