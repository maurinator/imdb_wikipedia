<p>A director (Pere Arquillué) is developing a ballet giving his interpretation to the biblical tale of Salome. He explains to the dancers and crew that in his version, Salomé (Aída Gómez) is in love for John the Baptist (Javier Toca). However, the rejection of her love associated to the poison of Herodias (Carmen Villena) makes the revengeful Salomé plot an evil scheme against John the Baptist. When King Herod (Paco Mora) asks the seductive Salomé to dance for him, she makes him promises to give anything she wants. In the end of her performance, she demands the head of John the Baptist.Carlos Saura promotes and gives a tribute to the Flamenco dance in his trilogy  "Bodas de Sangre", "Carmen" and "El Amor Brujo" and to the tango in "Tango". In Salomé, this great director shows the preparation and rehearsal of a ballet, with the director discussing representation, set decoration and lighting on the stage. The result is a beautiful ballet, full of colors and with a wonderful music score. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Salomé"</p>
