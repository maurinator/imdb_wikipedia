<h1>Into the Night (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ed Okin's life is somewhat out of control. He can't sleep, his wife betrays him and his job is dull. One night he starts to drive through Los Angeles and he finally ends in the parking garage of L.A. Airport. Moments later a beautiful young lady jumps onto his bonnet and he finds himself being chased by four Iranians. What follows is a wild chase through the streets of Los Angeles and a very funny one too.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent little gem of a movie, perfect for vidoe-rental for late night.  Landis's direction (and his star turn) are both crisp and well paced.  Is Los Angeles a land of secret places and pleasures?  Maybe yes, maybe not.  Probably depends on who you know or how much money you have.  But this little fantasy about a Californian bored with his job and unhappy in his marriage hits the notes as his all night adventure unfolds.  Wonderful cameos from a slew of stars.  Some excessive violence at times, but put there for a point, the point being the nature of Iran's old idiot-terror police, the Savak.  Maybe Landis knows of wherefore he speaks.As for nudity, almost enough.  More would have been better. Vidiot after vidiot has tried to stop action vidcap the too fast shots of naked Michelle.  The lovely Kathryn Harold keeps her clothes on but gets a gruesome Hollywood send-off, the single most difficult part of the film to watch. Don't hate this film if you don't get it.  This is a dark L.A. story, not a comedy, but I rank it as one of the best late-night movies ever made.Landis made the film he wanted to make and that's the first test of the director's skill.  If you peruse thru the comments list and get past Mr. too-boring-for-him, then take my word and watch this film.  It's perfect for a night when your troubles are keeping you up.  The film has a lot to say.</p>
