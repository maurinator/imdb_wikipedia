<h1>Too Many Crooks (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Accident-prone Fingers runs a pretty unsuccessful gang. They try and rob wealthy but tricky Billy Gordon - who distrusts banks and fears the Inland Revenue - but he sees Fingers and the boys off. So they decide to kidnap his daughter, only to end up with his wife Lucy. Gordon makes out he couldn't be more pleased, spurring Lucy to take charge of the hopeless bunch of villains.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Absolutely hysterical! I have never forgotten any of the Mario Zampi comedies I first saw as a teenager in the 1950s, especially this one & Laughter in Paradise. George Cole was in both (he's still around & working, lucky for us) & gives a brilliantly funny performance. Terry-Thomas has never been funnier. In this film he's like a broader version of Rex Harrison. Many of the set pieces (such as the undertakers in top hats pulling a criminal caper) & performances (especially by George Cole) seem like predecessors of Monty Python. The entire cast is perfect & includes Sid James & Bernard Bresslaw from the Carry On movies. One of the funniest films I've ever seen.</p>
