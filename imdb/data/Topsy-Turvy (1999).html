<h1>Topsy-Turvy (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After their production "Princess Ida" meets with less-than-stunning reviews, the relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan is strained to breaking. Their friends and associates attempt to get the two to work together again, which opens the way to "The Mikado," one of the duo's greatest successes.</p>
<p>Although a respectable hit, Gilbert and Sullivan's "Princess Ida" is criticized for being routine. Arthur Sullivan tends to agree, finding he has run out of musical ideas for Gilbert's increasingly predictable stories. He would rather be composing a full opera, an idea that jeopardizes not only the pair's relationship but the future of the stage company that Richard D'Oyly Carte has built around the comic operas. Then Mrs. Gilbert persuades her husband to take her to an exhibition of Japanese life....</p>
<p>After Gilbert and Sullivan's latest play is critically panned, the frustrated team threatens to disband until it is inspired to write the masterpiece "The Mikado".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not being a big fan of opera (of the comedic variety or otherwise), I chose to watch this movie as a period piece, hoping to see a lot of eccentric characters putting on even more eccentric theatre.  That was easy, since the trailer for the film points in that direction entirely.What I didn't expect was a thoroughly entrancing inside view of the Victorian theatre.  Not to mention comprehensive.  Everyone is covered in this - from the stage boy through the chorus through the leads and producers and assistant directors.  The telling of the complex relationships between the directors (Gilbert and Sullivan) and the leads is particularly poignant whether dealing with the actors' considerable egos or their individualpopularity among the chorus, nothing presented doesn't ring true.I loved everything about this movie. It's a great story, told wonderfully by all involved. It is truly a film of much love and craft.And I expect I'll be attending the next run of the Mikado next time it comes to town.</p>
