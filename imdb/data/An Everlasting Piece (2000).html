<h1>An Everlasting Piece (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Colm is a Catholic and George is a poetry-loving Protestant. In Belfast in the 1980s, they could have been enemies, but instead they became business partners. After persuading a mad wig salesman, known as the Scalper, to sell them his leads, the two embark on a series of house calls--always in neighborhoods that are dangerous for one or the other partner. Then they find out they may lose their exclusive wig distributorship to competitors. Through a series of comic twists, the pair are given large orders for wigs by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict. Should they compromise their principles in order to keep their business? Will it destroy their friendship? Could one of their wigs in the hands of the IRA actually put one or both of them in jail or even get them killed?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It never gets old. Very intelligent comedy and a meaningful plot. Its one of my most favorite films. Its a rare film. Rare as in- you don't find 'em like this very often. You hear the phrase "feel good movie" sometimes and that can sound a bit cheesy. But this truly is a feel good movie. Barry McEvoy's writing is awesome. Brilliant acting all around. Billy Connolly has a role in this as well and as always- he's the icing on the cake. Doesn't matter how you feel about the 'situations' in Ireland. Doesn't matter who's side you're on- and a lot of people take sides- its about sticking by your friends no matter what. Highly recommended. 10 stars!</p>
