<h1>Toys (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An eccentric toymaker's last wish is that his brother takes over the running of the business. The brother is a military General, and is out of touch with toymaking, and out of touch with reality too. The business should really have been given to Leslie, who was much more like his toymaking father. When the General starts making weapons instead of toys, Leslie decides to take action.</p>
<p>Leslie Zevo is the son of an eccentric toy maker. While Leslie was closest to his father and works as a toymaker himself, his Military General Uncle, Leland Zevo, inherits the toy making factory and begins making war toys. Leslie, however, does not see eye to eye with his Uncle, as his father had a policy against making War toys. When the General begins making live weaponry behind Leslie's back, and recruiting children to pilot his army, Leslie, his friends, and his family band together to put an end to the General's tyranny.</p>
<p>When a military general inherits a toy making company and begins making war toys, his employees band together to stop him before he ruins the name of Zevo Toys forever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember seeing this movie was first released, when I was seven, and I've loved ever since.  Even though I'm 19 now, I still enjoy watching it.  I really love Robing Williams and Joan Cusack's acting, especially Joan's.  Her character has always been my favorite.  The writing is very good, the humor is right on, the costumes are great(especially Alstatia's), the acting is great, the music is great(my favorite song is Happy Worker by Tori Amos).  I believe that this movie will be my favorite until the day I die.  One of my favorite scenes has to be when Leslie(Robin) is in the room with the three other people discussing the fake vomit, when the walls start coming in on them.  "Is this room getting smaller or am I bloated?" "Like we're getting attacked by a cross-word puzzle."  "Why does this has coconut in it?"-"Oh, that's diarrhea.  It shoudn't be here."  I give this movie 9 *'s out of 10 *'s.</p>
