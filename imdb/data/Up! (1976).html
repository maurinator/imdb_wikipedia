<h1>Up! (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This kicks off with the murder of one Adolf Schwartz (who bears a striking resemblance to another famous Adolf) by placing a ravenous piranha fish in his bathtub. Who did it? No-one knows or cares, as they're too busy being distracted by busty Margo Winchester, who hitch-hikes into# town and gets involved with all the local men. It all ends with a series of complicated plot twists that reveal that just about everyone is really someone else. And if it gets too confusing, Russ Meyer helpfully arranges for a one- woman nude Greek chorus to pop up at intervals to explain what's going on.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is something like the odd film out in Russ Meyer's later film career. In no way is it as well crafted as "Vixen", "The Supervixens" or "Beneath the Valley of the UltraVixens." Of course it's far superior to "Blacksnake," "The Seven Minuets," or "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls." As far as its "plot" is concerned, well, in order to have ANY appreciation of Russ Meyer films in general, you really can't be too concerned with the "plot" to begin with.What makes this movie worth watching (especially if you're a hetero male) is Raven De La Croix in the role of Margo Winchester. This Beautiful-Busty-Lovely-Dynamo Brunette Chick is IT--the bottom (and TOP) line.Actually, she's a little over-the-top, but that's part of her charm!This is Raven's one and only movie for Meyer, and it's a shame that he didn't use her as much as he did Uschi Digart or Kitten Natividad. It is truly a shame that Raven didn't get as many featuring roles as she should have in the 70s and 80s.As I said in another review, this movie makes for a fine half of a double feature with one of Raven's other movies, "The Lost Empire." You can watch them back to back believing that "Margo Winchester" is just an alias of "Whitestar." It has been joked about that a remake of this film should be done. Well, only if we can get Salma Hayek to play the part of Margo.</p>
