<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bored with watching Zombie Flesh Eaters? Fed up with trying to figure out the End of City of the Living Dead? Scared that you'll waste money on 500 late era Fulci horror flicks? Well, Conquest is the film for you....if you like drug-snorting wolfmen,people being split in two lengthwise, topless sun Goddesses, and a director who must have replaced his corn flakes with LSD, replaced his milk with LSD, then ate all that LSD with a special spoon, made of LSD.Fulci just goes beyond the call of duty in the 'creating another world' stakes, messing up just about every shot on purpose by pointing the camera in the direction of the sun. Otherworldly? How about 'throw out any notion of reality whatsoever'. Don't take this the wrong way though, the insane cinematography just helps this movie.And as for plot, well there's this guy, see, and he sort of appears on a beach with a whole bunch of transparent people, then gets sent on some sort of mission of some sort, with a magic bow. He ends up, erm, somewhere else, and ends up getting his arse kicked over and over again until an animal rights barbarian shows up and helps him, and the two of them travel the land, fighting folks, heading for the topless Godessess place. For some reason. Conquest is one of THE finest Italian insanity flicks I've sat down to watch - Here's a quick rundown of some of the madness:1) Grenades made from leaves and rocks 2) Plenty of gore, including feeding from a severed head like it was a coconut. 3) Dolphin rescue teams 4) zombies, and bizarre cobweb monkey things. 5) The most awful special effects of flying arrows you'll ever see. 6) Great almost techno-like score. 7) Gore galore 8) Sudden plot twist that comes out of nowhere for no reason. 9) Concrete Nunchuks!Great stuff all the way through - As it's a Fulci film, it has that dream-like quality that's almost like a sedative, but this film is a must for fans - get the Blue Underground, cleaned up, uncut version.</p>
