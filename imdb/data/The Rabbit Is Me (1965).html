<h1>The Rabbit Is Me (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Rabbit Is Me was made in 1965 to encourage discussion of the democratization of East German society. In it, a young student has an affair with a judge who once sentenced her brother for political reasons; she eventually confronts him with his opportunism and hypocrisy. It is a sardonic portrayal of the German Democratic Republic's judicial system and its social implications. The film was banned by officials as an anti-socialist, pessimistic and revisionist attack on the state. It henceforth lent its name to all the banned films of 1965, which became known as the "Rabbit Films." After its release in 1990, The Rabbit Is Me earned critical praise as one of the most important and courageous works ever made in East Germany. It was screened at The Museum of Modern Art in 2005 as part of the film series Rebels with a Cause: The Cinema of East Germany.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The bravery to tackle an issue that has even brought the risk of being locked up is what I mostly admire about this film. Although it took quarter of a century before it finally reaches the public, its being locked up seems to have preserved the radiant significance of its history--that, "for its struggle," it passed through several revisions of its script along the path of censorship.The actors' performances were magnificent and deserves a remark such swell. The treatment of the film, despite the seriousness of the issue tackled, remains not wholly burdened. What's noticeable to me are the matches used in the film to shift an event from space and time to the next. "The Rabbit is Me" is a truly precious work that lead a trend in the GDR documents. Special, 'tis! I'm giving this film an 8.</p>
