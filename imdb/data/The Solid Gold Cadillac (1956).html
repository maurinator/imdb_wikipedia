<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I taped it several years ago from my local PBS station and several times a year I run it again.  It's as fresh today as it was when first viewed. Judy Holliday was a gem.  She died much too early.  Her fans missed a lot because of her untimely passing.  Also, her pairing with Paul Douglas in this movie was inspired</p>
