<h1>Queen of Blood (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The year is 1990. An alien species makes contact with Earth through radio transmission, notifying of an imminent visit. Alien ship crash lands on Mars, and a rescue team is sent out from Earth. (The plot thickens! :) Eventually a surviving female is located and brought on to the human ship. The female is light green with an amazing hair-do. After some unsuccessful attempts by the human crew to feed her, she is more or less left to herself. (Ominous, is it not?) While most of the crew sleeps, the Alien female hypnotizes the astronaut on guard. When the crew awakens, she is sleeping, and the guard is DEAD! Brief examination shows that the Alien ate his blood. THE QUEEN OF BLOOD! Naturally, there is a lot of blood plasma on the ship, so they feed the alien using that supply. When they are almost home, however, yet another crew member is eaten, a fight breaks out, and the alien is accidentally killed before she can finish the third guy. Phew! The ship lands on Earth, finally! But there is trouble... The two remaining astronauts find a lot of eggs when they are about to leave the ship. Obviously the alien was a kind of bee-queen whose sole purpose was to spread their species to Earth, where there is a lot of yummy food... One of the astronauts tries to warn the arriving scientists of this danger, but they could not care less. Being scientists, they know what they are doing, so they collect the eggs and run happily along. The astronaut sums it up: "Well, at least I TRIED..."</p>
<p>It's the year 1990 and scientists receive a distress call from an alien spaceship that has crash-landed on Mars. Dr Farraday (Rathbone) decides to send a team of astronauts, including Allan Brenner (Saxon) and Paul Grant (Hopper), on a rescue mission. On the planet, they discover just one survivor. This green-skinned alien is brought aboard, but when one man is attacked and drained of his blood, the survivors are soon racing home, before they too become victim to the bloodsucker.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The thing that really stands out in this film is the visual style which was largely borrowed from a Russian Science Fiction classic. I'd really love to see that film. Of course the rest remains a lot of fun to watch as a young John Saxon and Dennis Hopper take flight to Mars and although it's paced a little too slowly, I still get a kick out of this movie especially the scene where the Alien Queen first sees Laura James. A likely inspiration for LIFEFORCE and possibly even ALIEN (although NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST , IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE and PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES are other contenders). I get the feeling at the end of this that a further ending was originally planned given all the hints Saxon was dropping about the Earth's light on his face.</p>
