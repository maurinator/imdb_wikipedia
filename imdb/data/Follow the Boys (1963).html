<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Four women, in various stages of romantic pursuit, "Follow the Boys" (men, actually) around European ports, mostly from a dilapidated old jalopy. The four females are: Connie Francis (as Bonnie Pulaski), Paula Prentiss (as Toni Denham), Janis Paige (as Liz Bradville) and Dany Robin (as Michele Perrier). Their "Boys" are: Russ Tamblyn (as Wadsworth Smith), Richard Long (as Peter Langley), Roger Perry (as Billy Pulaski), and Ron Randell (as Ben Bradville). The cast is likable, but the film is dull. Ms. Francis, not coincidently MGM's top selling recording artist, is especially noteworthy; with relatively little experience in films, she performs as well as anyone. However, Francis isn't given enough to do. After an Italian wine-stomping event, all's well that ends well.**** Follow the Boys (2/27/63) Richard Thorpe ~ Connie Francis, Paula Prentiss, Russ Tamblyn</p>
