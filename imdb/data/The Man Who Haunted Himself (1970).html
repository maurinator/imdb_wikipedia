<h1>The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While driving one evening, Harold Pelham appears possessed and has a car accident. While on the operating table, there even appears to be two heartbeats on the monitor. When he awakes, Pelham finds his life has been turned upside-down: he learns that he now supports a merger that he once opposed, and that he apparently is having an affair. People claim they have seen him in places that he has never been. Does Pelham have a doppelganger - or is he going insane?</p>
<p>Harold Pelham encounters a duplicate of himself in the aftermath of a car crash. After that moment his life is upset.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a big Roger Moore fan (the REAL 007) but I only heard about this film recently. I finally got a copy and I think it's a dynamite film. Not because I'm a big Moore fan - if a film sucks, I turn it off. But this movie is far better than all the reviews Ive ever read on it.I don't believe it drags at all - the pacing is great, especially where Moore keeps on discovering more and more people have seen "him" when it really was his double. Seeing hoe much deeper and deeper Moores double intergrates himself into Moore's life - his work, his liesure, his wife and home - is done extremely well. The inevitable confrontation between the two Pelhams is also done very well, and the ending is a kicker.Moore is great as usual and plays both roles with style and class.</p>
