This gets Brell to use him as an angle to get at Rip.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What's the only difference between this film and pro-wrestling? The movie is more predictable. Also, Hulk Hogan is not as good an actor on the big screen than he is at, say, WrestleMania. But if you're looking for mindless pro-wrestling dramatics, by all means, remember the name: NO HOLDS BARRED!</p>
