<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A English language Indian film thats simply superb! A sweet story of a newly married couple set around 60's India. The movie makes you nostalgic, Shashi Kapoor is fantastic. The film is shot in the old delhi and I think the essence of it hasn't changed since then. The movie reminds you of a well made play. The film is very honest in terms of portraying the normal (yet interesting) life of a newly married couple. I wish there were more Indian movies made like this. Its amazing, a film this old is actually so much more much better, funny, and enjoyable than a lot of the Bollywood movies made today. Go watch it and relish life.</p>
