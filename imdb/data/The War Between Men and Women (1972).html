<h1>The War Between Men and Women (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>2 quirky Manhattanites crash into each other cute at an ophthalmologist's office. Peter is a grouchy cartoonist/author whose vision is failing, divorced mother Theresa is also reluctant to plunge into a relationship right now. It's not love at first sight - both have their eyes dilated, plus Peter constantly lampoons women in his work, which book seller Theresa knows well. Loosely based on James Thurber's drawings "The War Between Men & Women," and Thurber's life, the film features animated sequences.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very cute, with clever interweaving of cartoon and live action ( particularly for an older movie.  Lemmon does an outstanding job, as does Gerritsen.  Many endearing scenes, peppered with mostly good fun throughout.</p>
