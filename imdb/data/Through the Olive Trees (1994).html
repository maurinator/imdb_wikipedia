<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An Iranian construction worker/actor wants to marry a woman orphaned by the earthquake.  But she is so much richer than she is.  "So what?", he tells the director (of a film within the film).  "If short men only married short women they would have short children and no-one would be able to reach the top of the cupboard."A film packed with Kiarostami minutiae on class and gender (and of course literacy), including exquisite scenes about forgotten geraniums and missing socks.</p>
