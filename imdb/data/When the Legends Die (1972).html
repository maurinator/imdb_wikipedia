<h1>When the Legends Die (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young, rebellious Ute Indian joins the rodeo circuit and falls in with a drunken mentor who teaches him the ways of the ring and the world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perhaps the best of the "aging rodeo cowboy" movies that mysteriously began to appear in 71-72 (Cliff Robertson's "J.W. Coop," Steve Inhat's "The Honkers" with James Coburn, and Sam Peckinpah's "Junior Bonner" with Steve McQueen).  What makes the difference is Richard Widmark who seems more appropriately cast than the stars of the rival rodeo films.  Widmark is excellent in perhaps the best of his later period roles.</p>
