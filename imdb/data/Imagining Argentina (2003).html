<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Imagining Argentina turns out to be exactly the movie suggested by the title...   a not-too-literal outsider's take on what the extra-judicial disappearances in 1970s Argentina might have been like.  As a result, it will potentially be highly annoying to anyone with any connection to Argentina - not only do the actors contrive to speak in an irritatingly accented English, but several key scenes play (deliberately?) fast and loose with history.  This in itself is not necessarily a problem - after all we were warned by the title not to expect a historically literal film - but in my view the resulting mish-mash of the plausible and the implausible is not particularly successful.That said, the film does fulfil the director's stated purpose of drawing world attention to a dark period of Argentina's history - maybe it's worthwhile just for that.</p>
