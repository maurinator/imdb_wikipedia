<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Oklahoma territory at the turn of the twentieth century, two young cowboys vie with an evil ranch hand and a traveling peddler for the hearts of the women they love.</p>
<p>Set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 1900s, this musical tells the story of two pairs of lovers. Curly is a cowboy who has trouble admitting his feelings to Laurey, as she does to him, because of their stubbornness. Judd, the hired hand at Laurey's farm, tries to come between them. Ado Annie is torn between Will, a cowboy who has strong feelings for her, and Ali Hakim, a peddler who's a ladies' man and doesn't want to marry her.</p>
<p>Just before Oklahoma became a new state, Laurey Williams notices that Curly, a handsome though shy ranch hand, has been acting strangely around her. Through some course of events, she and Curly soon realise the feelings they have for each other. Judd, a hired hand at Laurey's home, also has feelings for her. Together, she and Curly have to do something to save their relationship and keep Judd from doing something terrible. Woven into this plot is the life of Ado Annie, one of Laurey's friends. Her boyfriend has just gotten back from an exciting trip to Kansas City. While he was away, she has fallen for a peddler who is a ladies' man and doesn't really want to marry her. Does she give Will, her boyfriend, "all or nuthin'", or does she run away with the peddler? Set against the backdrop of ranching Oklahoma, this musical is full of fun, music, and romance for everyone.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the great land of Oklahoma there is no better romance blossoming than that between Curly (Gordon McRae) and Laurie (Shirley Jones). Just these two people alone would make the movie a perfect 10. But then you add Eddie Albert, and the characters Will and Ado Annie, and you have a 100! The music is delightful, so delightful, in fact, that you'll probably want to go and buy the soundtrack the minute after you hear the first song. Some really drop-dead-funny parts (Persian good-byes and Oklahoma hellos, Poor Jud is Dead) and some real romance. Excellent. I highly suggest it for people who like wester musical romances.</p>
