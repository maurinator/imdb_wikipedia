<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like the full versions of Shakespeare on film and will happily put in the effort for the reward.  However I do like the cut versions (Richard III, Romeo & Juliet etc), yes they are for the short of attention MTV generation, but is that a bad thing?It's good to get a new generation into these plays. In this version Brannagh gives an effortless performance (he can do shakespeare in his sleep) and Fishburne is great as the main character tortured by the betrayal and lack of honour of those around him.(although at times i was listening for the "Shaft" theme song - he did play it a bit street-tuff at time!).A cut version yes, but it looks beautiful and is more accesible than other versions.</p>
