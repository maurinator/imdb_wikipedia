<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another extremely low budget Roger Corman produced film about the bleak future. What makes this one interesting for me is Kim Greist. I've always found her intriguing but underused and this is a very rare starring role for her. There are a lot of pin-up type actress's in this film and Greist although very attractive, is not that sort of actress. So her intelligence and character stand out even more. Even in a real silly story such as this is enough to showcase her natural talent. I hope to see more of her. In anything!</p>
