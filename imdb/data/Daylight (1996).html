<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stallone returned after a break from action movies to make "Daylight."  Here he tried to make his character more three dimensional, a human with weaknesses and flaws rather than the mute and destruction minded heroes of some of his other movies.Making Latura as a human was a good idea, and you get to like him, although the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up it's end.  It plays as some cross between the "Poseidon Adventure" and an Irwin Allen disaster film, with an uplifting musical score.  You know pretty quickly who's going to live and die, and even though Latura is a mere mortal, only he can save those lives.Still, "Daylight" makes a good diversion, and the "good guy really is a good guy" concept works for the most part.</p>
