<p>The Gong Show Movie is a 1980 film that shows a fictional week in the life of Chuck Barris as the host and creator of The Gong Show, through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a Roman Catholic priest and three nuns lip-synching Tom Lehrer's song "The Vatican Rag", the uncensored version of Jaye P. Morgan's infamous breast-baring incident and a man blowing out a candle with flatulence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Actually, it's a MUST see for Gong Show fans.The film is uneven, but there are some excellent scenes such as the hospital scene.Plus, you get to see Gong Show rarities like the popsicle twins and Jaye P.'s unsheathing.Note that 30% of the voters (so far) have given this film a 10 and about 30% have given it a 1 !</p>
