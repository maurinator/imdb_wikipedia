<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON is the ultimate family adventure film from Disney, photographed on the island of Tobago for some lush scenery and exotic settings. But that tree house rules!! Everyone's favorite fantasy is this sort of adventure whereby a shipwrecked family finds refuge on what appears to be a deserted island, only to find that they're not exactly alone.DOROTHY McGUIRE and JOHN MILLS play the parent roles (played originally by Thomas Mitchell and Edna Best in the B&W '40 version), and the kids are played with equal skill by Kevin Corcoran, Tommy Kirk and JAMES MacARTHUR, who excels as the oldest son.There's some rough going when the pirates invade, but it's all done in true Disney style and you know there's going to be a happy ending.Summing up: The kind of film the whole family can enjoy. A lot more visually appealing than the old B&W version filmed on RKO sound stages.</p>
