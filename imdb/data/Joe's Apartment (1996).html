<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>A nice guy has just moved to New York and discovers that he must share his run-down apartment with a couple thousand singing, dancing cockroaches.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Decided to pick a film I'd never heard of- this turned out to be very funny especially the songs of the cockroaches.  Connolly plays a down on his luck character well and the scene at the 911 operations is hilarious-- even my son was laughing along with me. Whoever designed the set deserves credit for their creativity.. a funny film that deserved more credit than it got.</p>
