<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, I'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies.  Still, it was more appealing to me for it's moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite.  My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie, "Hollywood Shuffle".  True, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable, but his movies are still fun.Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel.  I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics.  Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car broken into, bad neighborhood, local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution, etc.  The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.What I found to be truly entertaining, outside of James Earl Jones' "young forever" performance, was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers.  It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course.  It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks #1 with my kids.  Robert Townsend works to bring movies "home" so to speak.  I doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is, but there are and will always be, those that love him for his efforts.One point to ponder about the film, which I find amusing: Throughout the entire battle with Simon, no one bothered to call the police???? Also, what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there, scrapping by my side, toe-to-toe. Dad would be loading his pistol.  lolRent it and check it out.  It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc.  Great job with the cameos Robert!</p>
