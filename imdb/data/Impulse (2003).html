<h1>Impulse (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Enterprise answers an automated distress call of the Vulcan ship Seleya, lost in the Expanse 9 months ago. Captain Archer, T'Pol, Lt. Reed and Cpl. Hawkins dock Shuttlepod One with Seleya, only to be attacked by the survivors. The Vulcan crew have been reduced to zombie-like drones, permanently brain-damaged by a neurotoxin in the Trellium. Meanwhile, Enterprise navigates an unpredictable asteroid field rich in Trellium, an ore that can be refined to make a vital insulation for traveling the expanse with minimal damage from the anomalies. Tucker and Mayweather land Shuttlepod Two on an asteroid to mine the ore.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Enterprise receives a distress call from the Vulcan ship Seleya where T'Pol had served before going to Earth, but there are asteroids with random movements in her way. Archer, T'Pol, Reed and Corporal Hawkins get Shuttlepod One to reach Seleya, but they are attacked by the Vulcan survivors that act like zombies and seal the bulkheads, and the rescue team is not able to return to their docked vehicle. When T'Pol feels that she is being also affected in the Seleya, she transmits the data she had obtained to Dr. Phlox for analysis. Dr. Phlox finds that a toxin in the Trellium causes brain damage in the Vulcans and T'Pol has to immediately return to the Enterprise for treatment. However, Shuttlepod Two needs to be repaired after an unsuccessful trial of Trip and Travis of bringing Trellium ore from one asteroid to be refined."Impulse" is a tense episode with great performance of Jolene Blalock when her character becomes paranoid and incapable of controlling her emotions. The Vulcan survivors look like zombies, returning to the primitive status of violent race. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Impulso" ("Impulse")</p>
