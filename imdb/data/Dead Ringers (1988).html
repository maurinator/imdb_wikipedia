<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Mantle brothers are both doctors - both gynecologists - and identical twins. Mentally however, one of them is more confident than the other, and always manages to seduce the women he meets. When he's tired of his current partner, she is passed on to the other brother - without her knowing. Everything runs smoothly, until an actress visits their clinic, and the shy brother is the first to fall in love. Will they be able to 'share' her ?</p>
<p>Beverly and Elliot Mantle are identical twin brothers who work in a joint practice as award winning research and practicing gynecologists. They both have been fascinated with the female reproductive system since they were children. Despite being physically identical, they are extreme opposites in personality, Elliot being the extrovert, Beverly the introvert. As such, they live a symbiotic life, with one's strength being the other's weakness, both personally and professionally. The two brothers, under the guise of being Beverly alone, begin a sexual relationship with visiting actress Claire Niveau, who comes to see Beverly professionally about a physical abnormality which may prevent her from being able to conceive. Claire is unaware that Beverly has a twin brother let alone that she has had sex with him. When Claire finds out, she is initially disgusted but continues to have a relationship solely with Beverly. Beverly's growing obsession with Claire and her physical abnormality ultimately shows how symbiotic and intertwined the brothers' live are and the fact that one can't live without the other.</p>

They're both seeing Claire Niveau who realizes the differences between the two - she knows only of Beverly - but can can't quite explain the differences in personality. When a friend tells her about them being twins, the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. For Elliot, Claire is just another plaything but Beverly has developed genuine feelings for her and he begins a downward spiral leading to tragedy.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very fine film that challenges and rewards just about equally and somehow has a downbeat ending that manages to be uplifting. I suppose we have been through a lot by the end and although there is an horrific sadness there is an awful inevitability and we like the twin brothers can finally see no other way out. Bujold plays a starlet who comes between two identical twins (Irons in his two best screen performances!) and whilst the tale begins playfully enough we are given enough signals to suggest all will not be well, although we like all three leads do hope so. We see ourselves in the three and if at first we are confounded to discover we are confused by who is who, just when we have got the two under some control, like Bujold indeed, it all goes wrong and the brothers switch personalities before our very eyes. This is all disturbing enough without the gynaecological instruments of torture and the playing with pain and pleasure leading us to some darkened room.</p>
