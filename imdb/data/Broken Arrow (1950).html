<h1>Broken Arrow (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>By 1870, there has been 10 years of cruel war between settlers and Cochise's Apaches. Ex-soldier Tom Jeffords saves the life of an Apache boy and starts to wonder if Indians are human, after all; soon, he determines to use this chance to make himself an ambassador. Against all odds, his solitary mission into Cochise's stronghold opens a dialogue. Opportunely, the president sends General Howard with orders to conclude peace. But even with Jeffords's luck, the deep grievance and hatred on both sides make tragic failure all too likely.</p>
<p>Based on the real-life efforts of Tom Jeffords, this film dramatizes his efforts to make peace with Apache chief Cochise. After helping a young Indian boy, Cochise sets Jeffords free leading him to think that there may be a way to make peace in the war that has now lasted nearly 10 years. He takes time to learn their language and customs and then sets out to see if they can get safe passage for the mail riders who are always being ambushed. He succeeds, developing a mutual respect with the Apache leader. Not everyone is in favor of the deal with some settlers as well as Apaches refusing to go along and intent on doing what they can to break the peace. Jeffords pays a high price because of those efforts but his perseverance did lead to several conflict-free years.</p>
<p>Tom Jeffords tries to make peace between settlers and Apaches.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tagline: Of this motion picture the screen can be proud... Today... Tomorrow... A generation from now...Worth repeating this tagline, because after seeing the film again for the first time in 42 years, it's right on. 50s westerns almost universally depicted Indians as pigeon-English speaking savages... or tried to talk Indian that translated to pigeon-Indian.While the leading cast is all-Anglo, the perspective is that both sides in the Wild West were had more than a few intelligent, caring individuals among them. A willingness to sacrifice much (including renegades) to achieve a lasting peace is the message.Jimmy Stewart had something to lose by doing a picture like this, but the acting here stands with any in his career. The portrayal of Cochise by Jeff Chandler is powerful, although unquestionably a little bit too noble-savagish."Let's mosey on over there" is a line spoken by Stewart toward the end of the film. Takes you back to a time when people took time to mosey.A good-hearted picture by a little-known director standing up against the prevailing stereotypes. Wouldn't be surprised if Costner watched it more than once before making "Dances with Wolves".</p>
