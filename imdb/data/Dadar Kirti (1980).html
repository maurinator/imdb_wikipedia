<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautiful...touchy...and reminds of the old Bengali family tradition... I think this is enough to say about this movie.The director of this movie is Tarun Majumder and the movie is made depending on a story of Saradindu Banerjee. Story--Kedar (Tapas Pal), a dim-witted simpleton, is exiled to his uncle's house in a small town in Bihar by his father, who is extremely angry with him for being unable to pass his BA exams even after three attempts. The simple minded Kedar becomes the butt of all jokes of his cousin Santu's (Ayan Banerjee) gang of friends led by Bhombolda also known as bumble bhattacharj (Anup Kumar). He falls in love with Saraswati (Mohua Roychoudhury) a girl with a strong no-nonsense character who is also the elder sister of Santu's betrothed Bini (Debashree Roy). Saraswati's parents too are also impressed by Kedar's decency and simplicity and she also softens up to Kedar. However, Bhombolda and his gang create misunderstandings between the two. An extremely disappointed Saraswati decides to get married with a rich boy from Bhagalpur. But at the end, bhombolda realizes that Kedar has a heart of gold and admits his wrondoing leading Saraswati getting married to Kedar. I think every one should watch this movie.</p>
