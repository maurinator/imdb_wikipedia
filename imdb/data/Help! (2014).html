<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This short film is about a homeless guy struggling to fit into society in streets of Manhattan, even though he has a very warm-heart and would help anybody in need instantly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think, it is a good and at the same time risky idea to make a silent short film in 5 minutes which is based on a true story. The short film is also in black-and-white, but you have mastered this difficult task very well. The main actor Quamel is also excellent. He is a real homeless person in New York City and therefore he plays his role in an very authentic way. The music fits the film perfectly. The beats of the music are adjusted according to the scene changes. Then the film ends with a quote of Leo Tolstoy "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself" - a message to the audience to think or rethink about the topic mentioned in the short film.Very successful and impressive short film. I am very excited. Keep it up!</p>
