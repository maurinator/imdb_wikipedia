<h1>The Seven-Ups (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Buddy, Barilli, Mingo and Ansel, detectives with the NYPD, comprise a secret investigative unit called the Seven-Ups, who, largely undercover, focus on cases leading to felony convictions with prison sentences of seven years or more for the criminals in question. Many within the NYPD who know about the unit don't support the idea of it because of the often unethical way they work on the cases, but their superior, Inspector Gilson, defends the unit solely because of the results. On the sly, Buddy, who is the head of the team, gets much of the information for the cases from Vito Lucia, a childhood friend who still lives and works in the old neighborhood where much of the crime is based. Vito knows that his life could be in danger if the mob finds out that he acts as a snitch for the police. After Buddy starts looking into the loan sharking business of some local mob members, unknown to him some of those mob members are shaken down for a minimum $100,000 apiece, one by one kidnapped for ransom before they are released when the extortionists are able to abscond with the ransom money. The M.O. of the extortionists is for two to act as police detectives bringing the mob member in for questioning, before showing their true colors of kidnapping the person for ransom. The mob has no reason to doubt that the men truly are NYPD gone bad. Buddy even sees one of them taken in, a bail bondsman named Festa with mob ties, he knowing that what he witnessed was not what it appeared on the surface, however unaware that this situation was not a one off in the scuttlebutt he had previous heard about general unrest on the streets. By the time that Buddy learns of the serial kidnappings and the unofficial war the mob has with the NYPD because of it, Buddy and the team are determined to nab the mastermind behind the extortions as it has become more than a professional issue for them.</p>
<p>New York City cops wage a war against assorted hoods and criminals after one of their own is brutally killed by a hoodlum. Seven-Ups refers to the minimum jail time each of the crooks will have to spend if they are caught.</p>
<p>The seven-ups are a secret, elite New York detective squad who are very effective in catching criminals, even if their tactics are questionable. However, what one of the detectives doesn't know is that one of his informants is mastermind of a plot to kidnap loan sharks. The kidnappers get to their victims by impersonating police officers. While investigating one of the disappearances, one of the seven-ups gets spotted and is killed. The situation puts the seven-ups in a precarious position because it looks like they are tied to the kidnappings. So now one detective has to find the murderers and clear the seven-ups' soiled reputation.</p>
<p>A sting takes place at an antique store that is a front for laundering counterfeit money. It is the latest success of The Seven-Ups, a squad of undercover NY policemen whose collars regularly get sentences of seven years or up. Two mobsters are presently in the squad's sights - Max Kalish, a businessman, and Festa, a bail bondsman. However, Buddy Manuchi, the Seven-Ups' leader, gets wind of strange and violent happenings within the mob, unaware that Max Kalish was kidnapped and held until payment of a huge ransom, and now he and other mobsters are in panic mode. Things then go from bad to worse for both The Seven-Ups and Kalish's mob when one the the squad's members is found out and tied up in a car trunk, only to see the real kidnappers grab Cotello, one of Kalish's partners, and blast him and the helpless undercover cop. When Buddy arrives on the scene, the real killers flee, and a mad car chase through the streets of New York blasts onto the country freeway and ends in a savage crash into the underside of a crippled 18-wheeler. The Seven-Ups now probe to find out who is kidnapping mobsters to find the killers of their partner, and Buddy suddenly realizes they have a police mole working for them.</p>
<p>A tough detective who is part of an elite New York City unit is trying to find out who killed his partner, but uncovers a plot to kidnap mobsters for money.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Every studio that has made a police movie over the last twenty years should be forced to watch this film and learn a thing or two. The story is this: A group of renegade cops known as "The Seven-Ups" seek revenge against the hoods that murdered one of their own. Original idea? Maybe not, but considering the film is loosely based on actual events and was made in 1973 it was way before its time. Sure there were the "Death Wishes" and "The French Connections," back in the day, but I would be hard pressed to find a more gritty and intelligent film to match wits with this one from an era long forgotten.The always fantastic Roy Scheider (who regardless of his current status as an actor, i.e. being forced to play pathetic roles for a paycheck due to his age, etc by industry standards) plays the main character flawlessly, supported by a cast of hard hitting fellow cops are on the trail of a gang of hoods who are impersonating police officers and shaking down mobsters, only to rough them up (and in some cases kill them)for the money they are carrying.When one of Schieder's crew gets killed in a botched robbery, and Schieder and his boys become suspects by their own department, they take matters into their own hands, and try to clear their names and find those responsible by any means necesary. That takes place in the first half hour, and everything minute to follow is one exciting moment after the next, including THE BEST CAR CHASE EVER! Period.I could go on forever as to what a well-crafted film this is, but for those who have been sleeping under rocks for the past two decades (or some who are simply too young to have seen it the first go round) my words cannot do justice, but you can bet "The Seven-Ups" can...Simply put, don't wait another minute to see this bad-ass, because they don't make 'em like they used too...</p>
