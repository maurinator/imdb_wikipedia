<p>In the early 60s, two best friends and brothers-in-law, Willie, who's being pursuit by the police after a shooting because they don't know it was in self-defense, and Frank, whose kidneys are failing, agree to take part in an experiment where they would be cryogenically frozen for a while. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned and they are left frozen and forgotten. Eventually they awake by accident in 1991.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just recently saw this film and enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was not what I had expected.  So many of the "freeze 'em" films take a comic or campy approach.  But this film tries to deal with the actual problems that could arise if a person were able to disappear and then reappear some 30 years later.  A nice treatment of the question.</p>
