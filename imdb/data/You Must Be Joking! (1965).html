<h1>You Must Be Joking! (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A motley group of soldiers are set loose on swinging England in an initiative test to collect a selection of esoteric items.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Something of a precursor of the swinging sixties "comedy." It still has the makings of the 1940s 1959s British comedies, but some of the silliness of the later 1960s comedy films is starting to creep in.The performance of the film is probably Lionel Jeffries as the caricature of a Scotsman. (Perhaps even more interesting is not so much his performance as the reactions of the other scavengers to his character. In one scene he asked someone on the set to give him something Gaelic to say. Someone duly did. Lionel Jeffries was not to know that it meant: "Kiss my ass." But it went unnoticed...until the film was shown in Ireland! All in all, it's great fun. One should not take it too seriously.</p>
