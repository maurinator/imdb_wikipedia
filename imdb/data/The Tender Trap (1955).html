<h1>The Tender Trap (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Charlie Reader is a successful theater agent. He is also successful with young ladies. One day he is visited by his old friend Joe, married with three children. Joe falls in love with Charlie's girl Sylvia while Charlie spends his time with young actress Julie.</p>
<p>Broadway agent Charlie is a man about town with a girl for every occasion. Maybe classical violinist Sylvia tops the list, but she's still just a dame. Best buddy Joe, staying over to take a break from his marriage, watches bemusedly while becoming increasingly attracted to Sylvia himself. When young Julie turns up for audition and rebuffs Charlie's advances it looks like he might be becoming a one gal guy. But she has her own grand plan for her future and if he is to be part of it he will have to make commitments quite awful to contemplate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this film because it is so reflective of the mid-50's sensibility and the glamour of New York at that time. All of the actors have wonderful chemistry, and Celeste Holm is a stand out as Sinatra's "fiancee" Debbie Reynolds is adorable as a 22 year old ingenue who wants a career in the theatre, but only for a brief time. She has a plan to get married, have three children and live in Scarsdale, which everyone knows has the best school system in the country. Sinatra and David Wayne are old friends and the married Wayne comes to New York to take a vacation from his wife. He becomes interested in Holm and falls in love with her. Sinatra falls in love with Debbie Reynolds and their scenes are just lovely. Complications ensue, but in the end, it all shakes out. This is one of the best adaptations of a 1950's stage comedy and it is most enjoyable and certainly worthwhile.</p>
