<h1>D-Day the Sixth of June (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>'Twas the night before D-Day. One ship, carrying Special Force Six, leaves ahead of the main invasion on a dangerous mission. On board are British Colonel Wynter and American Captain Parker, who each, in flashback, reminisce about their separate involvements with beauteous Valerie Russell. Will the coming battle (confined to the film's last fifteen minutes) determine which one comes home to her?</p>
<p>En route to Normandy, an American and a British officer reminisce in flashback about their romances with the same woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, we'll keep this one short:  lots of big stars (Robert Taylor, Dana Wynter, Edmund O'Brien, et al), lots of extras, lots and lots of talking, but absolutely no sense of urgency or feeling of impending action is present in this hour and 46 minute blabfest.  In fact, for the first 80 minutes, nothing much happens.  Yes, Taylor is quite handsome in his military uniform and, yes, Ms. Wynter is very fetching in her military uniform and, yes, a predictable romance develops with an equally predictable ending, but THAT'S IT!!  That's the whole plodding film in a nutshell.  Believe us, if movies about the greatest invasion in history are the sort of thing that floats your boat, you would be much better advised to stick with "The Longest Day".  This over-processed turkey spread shoulda stayed in the can.</p>
