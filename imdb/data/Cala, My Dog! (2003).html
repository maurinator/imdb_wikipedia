<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like this movie.It contains several real scenes in the Beijing lower class families. Although Beijing is a big city in China now, there are still some poor families with some members in have some unrealistic dreams. But Beijing people treat their dogs really seriously. They think dogs are part of the family just like Americans do.But Ge You's role has some disease in his heart. His love to the dog is not the real love. Kala is only a mental object of his own. He depends on the dog. He is a failure man.If you want to know something about the traditional Beijing life.This movie may help.</p>
