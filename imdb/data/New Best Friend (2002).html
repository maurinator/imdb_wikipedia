<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At fancy, private Colby University, in the North Carolina hills, a drug overdose puts a senior near death. The school administration calls in the acting sheriff to conduct "a delicate and discrete investigation" - a whitewash. The more he digs, the more evidence he finds that the overdose may have been attempted murder. In flashbacks that parallel his investigation, we see Alicia, a scholarship girl worried about her grades, gradually pulled into the social life of three rich and amoral young women, led by the blond Hadley, a femme fatale. Before the investigation ends, we've met boyfriends, a drug dealer, Alicia's mom, Hadley's dad, nurses, doctors, and an orderly.</p>
<p>Three rich, wild college students lure an innocent girl into their dangerous world of sex, partys and drugs. When somthing gose wrong, one of the girls ends up unconcious and close to death from an overdose. A deputy begins his investigation and uncovers a web of lies and betrayals.</p>
<p>A North Carolina sheriff investigates the near-fatal drug overdose of an underachieving college girl, and uncovers many sordid details of her life before and during her descent into drugs and debauchery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented "New Best Friend" hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as "Gossip" and "The Curve".  Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd", in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony.  "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same.  Skip this movie...it's a waste of time.</p>
