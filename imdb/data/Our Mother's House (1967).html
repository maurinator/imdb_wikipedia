<h1>Our Mother's House (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When their deeply religious mother dies, the seven Hook children bury her in the garden and continue life as normal. Then their absent father , Charlie, reappears...</p>
<p>Evangelical Violet Hook, ill and largely bedridden, has hired Mrs. Quayle as a part-time housekeeper, her duties including looking after the seven Hook children, Elsa, Diana, Hubert, Dunstan, Jiminee, Gerty and Willy, who range in age from young teen to young adolescent. Despite her illness, Violet has not used the services of a physician, she suspect of anyone of authority. When Violet dies in bed at home, the children decide not to tell anyone, fearing the consequences of the unknown if they do. They bury their mother in their backyard, continue with their dedicated "mother time" by setting up a shrine in their backyard tabernacle (which in reality is a shed) with Diana claiming that she can "speak" to their mother, and live off her annuity checks with artistically inclined Jiminee able to forge her signature, while they hope to keep her savings for a rainy day as she had intended. On a day-to-day basis, they have differing views on what to do, with Elsa being overwhelmed by the responsibility of being the oldest, Hugh being the nurturing one, Dunstan the fire and brimstone evangelical, and the three youngest largely oblivious to the severity of their situation, especially Gerty, the overly trusting one. All they all know is that they have to keep adults out of the house, especially the likes of opportunistic Mrs. Quayle and their teacher, Miss Bailey. Things change for them with the arrival back into their lives of Charlie Hook, Violet's long gone husband who only Elsa knew existed as a live person before their mother's death. The children's view of Charlie in their lives is as diverse as their personalities. Over time, they will figure out if having Charlie in their lives is to their benefit, and if not what they have to do for a sustainable long term future for them as a collective.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From the first scene of the film one can already tell that there is fine cinematography. We see a girl walking the street of a suburban part of London and immediately one knows that this is a film different to many others  it's slow, it's silent, and still it's intriguing and exciting. Accompanied by an equally great musical score by Georges Delerue, Jack Claytons direction is outstanding. He presents eight children whose sick mother passes away one morning. Upon their close relationship on the one and their fear of being torn apart from each other at the other side, the children decide to keep on living `normally', as if their mother was still alive. They manage to keep up a cover story for teachers and neighbors while their relationship gets even closer. As expectable with children these age (ranging from, I'd guess, ages 3 to 12), they create their rituals (the German translation of the title is `Every evening at 9 o'clock') and manage to find a way to keep in touch with their world `before'  when the beloved mother was still live. They achieve that aim by mixing up religious belief with their childrenlike, yet never naïve `rationality'. But of course, their secret cannot be kept forever or can it?  Dirk Bogarde is great in his role because he convincingly shows the two sides of his character: Loving at one part, but altogether selfish. But credits must go to the incredible cast of children whose performances draw the viewer into the story and force him to stay there. It is one of those rare films were the audience develops real sympathy for the figures. The ending, though probably not all too surprising, is the highlight of the picture and contains a great deal of melancholy. One wonders how the story would continue  but on the other hand, everything that needs to be said is said. As other comments already stated, not a film for children, but one of the best film about children ever made; it's goal was to achieve an insight into the world of a childs mind, and it succeeds brilliantly.</p>
