<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let's start with the ugly just to get it out of the way. I think this movie would have been considered a cult classic on par with Harold and Maude if someone besides Belushi had played Homer. At times he seemed to fall out of character at others it just looked like he was an actor playing a retarded person and very rarely he seemed in character. It wasn't a role that could be pulled off by over-acting or playing bigger than life. This was a great role played by the wrong actor. Now the bad, the continuity and sound track distracted from the story, How would people recognize Homer if he had been gone since childhood and his parents had denied him? The times you were expected to suspend belief to forward the story or develop characters were too glaring and the music was out of sync with the moods. But yet I gave it a 5 out of 10 because of the good. Whoopi who is not my favorite actress did everything with her character that Belushi could not do with his, and the story as a whole and what it was trying to convey about the cast-aways of society kept me watching to see the inevitable ending.</p>
