<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you go to a superhero movie and you have problems with guys wearing tight spandex, then you'd better just close your eyes.  Superheroes wear tight clothes...get over it.  I think one of the best parts of this film is that they make very little reference to it.  The Henson Creature Shop did an excellent job re-creating the look of the classic Phantom character while giving it just a bit more style.  As for the characters, they were light and enjoyable.  They don't need to be "deep" or meaningful..they need to be comic characters and they succeeded admirably.  The plot was simple, but engaging and the villains were perfect, no good, evil comic book baddies. This is a great movie to give you the feel for what the real old adventure serials were about.</p>
