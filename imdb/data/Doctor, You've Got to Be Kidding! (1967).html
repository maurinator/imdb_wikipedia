<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Early twenty-something innocent Heather Halloran has always been pushed by her stage mother, Louise Halloran, to be a professional singer, despite Heather not wanting that as a career and having only modest talent as a singer. Against Louise's goal, Heather instead gets an office job working as a secretary for Harlan W. Wycliff, who has a mind and thus behaves like a computer. As such, he *knows* he's always right, including that his secretaries fall in love with him because he's young, powerful, wealthy and attractive. To prove Harlan wrong on another issue and thus knock his superior attitude down a notch or two, Heather takes Louise up on her offer for $5,000, which required Louise to re-mortgage her house, for professional help in putting together a musical act. Through her dealings with Harlan and the serious pursuit of that musical career, Heather embarks on trial relationships with three men who have doggedly pursued her: Dick Bender, a childhood friend and longtime neighbor who has been around the block a few times; Pat Murad, her arranger and singing coach, who is a bit of a lush; and Hank Judson, a shoe salesman and struggling actor, who specializes in overly dramatic death scenes. In the process, Heather gets pregnant. Each of Dick, Pat and Hank, who loves her in his own way, wants to marry Heather. But Heather comes to the realization that she only wants the love of one man, the person who got her pregnant, that person being... he who does not know he's the father.</p>
<p>Heather is the lead singer for a band that is on its way to fame and fortune. Things get complicated when she becomes pregnant and has three men willing to be both husband and father. But her boss isn't one of them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rate this movie this highly because it does extremely well exactly what it sets out to do--provide a couple of hours of entertaining fluff. In the wake of the news of the death of Sandra Dee, I was asked for my favorite Sandra Dee movie, and I realized this is it! The ever-delightful Celeste Holm and the protective stage mother, George Hamilton too perfect as the snotty boss, the late Bill Bixby, for whom I'll never stop mourning, the sweet friend wanting to help out, and an enjoyable appearance by Mort Sahl, a groundbreaking comedian of the time who now is, unjustly, almost completely forgotten.A movie that does what it sets out to do and does it well deserves praise, and this one has mine.Today, Sandra Dee joins my "eternal mourning" list.</p>
