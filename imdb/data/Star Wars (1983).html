<h1>Star Wars (1983)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Star Wars: The Arcade Game was the first Star Wars arcade and the second Star Wars game of all times. There are three levels, Easy, Medium and Hard.Each one has more Bonus points than the other.The Easy has 0, the Medium has 3000 and the Hard has 6000 points. And there are three courses, TIE Fighters, Outer Defenses and The Trench Run. The graphics of Star Wars: The Arcade Game are in color vector mode.It was very good graphics for the Atari Dynasty. The good part is the original voices of Obi-Wan and Han Solo.</p>
