<h1>Opasen char (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>He is well educated, charming, and gallant - a dream for each lonely lady. In reality he is a skillful swindler, who robs naive women. Cheating merchants with guilty consciences are his targets as well. This is the elusive protagonist of the movie. He constantly changes his name, stages his own death, and travels from town to town. His exploits are myriad and his life is an endless adventure. Yet, he remains an amiable swindler, an unrealized actor, whose only goal is make his life more interesting.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How can a bald and short and not so handsome middle aged man manages to transform himself as an attractive and charming figure in the eyes of women?! Only with the spectacular way of speech and with the sufficient level of intellectuality! This is what Gencho Gunchev (or Yastrebovski or Orelski or Sokolov etc.) is all about! Sometimes he is a passionate and farseeing urbanist architect, sometimes he is an aggrieved clerk, sometimes he is a strict and legalistic police officer. He is so clever, he never leaves traces but like the other serial criminals, he has one single weakness. In this case this is; Ludwig van Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata". Now, you can track down this "serial robber" and catch him!"...like my good friend, Frank Lloyd Wright said!"</p>
