<p>The designers must create a swimsuit that can double as evening wear.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now the designers have to design a swimming suite that can also be worn at a party. And the winner will make it in the newspaper in the morning. Some of the models and designers really tried hard at the party to get attention. At the end Austin won and Alexandra lost as her suite lacked originality.A pretty fun idea for a design. And Morgan caused some trouble once again. I loved Jay and Austin's suites. Can see how they were competing for the best. The rest were really not my thing, I had trouble predicting this time who would lose. Robert's in my opinion was not good looking at all. But I guess they stay consistent and punish the lack of originality which is a good thing. Kevin didn't really do anything wrong. It was a bathing suite that looked like a dress, seems just like what they asked for.Looked up Alexandra, she seems to have gone pretty far in the business. Collections for every season. not all her dresses are my thing but others are awesome, and I guess this is good for a designer, it means she appeals to different tastes.</p>
