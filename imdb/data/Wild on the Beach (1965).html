<h1>Wild on the Beach (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Adam Miller and Lee Sullivan both lay claim to a beach house for student boarders. Problems arise when both boys and girls show up to live there. They're soothed by the music of Sonny and Cher, Jackie and Gayle, Sandy Nelson, and the Astronauts. By the time the movie ends, you feel as though you've gotten to know all the actors personally, and the bands have been playing in your living room all night.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Star Trek, the robot, the one that my dad laughed at while making kid-appropriate, leering comments about her almost-not-there outfit? Yup, Sherry Jackson.And the university president, a guy who played a million officious dinkwads on TV?Yup, whatshisname. Oh, yeah. Looked him up--Booth Colman. I always confused him with Richard Dysart, but he got his hands bitten off in The Thing.Forgive me, I digress. Colman would become the face of Washington Mutual Bank back in the late '70s.And Sonny and Cher, with Cher in her 20s and, well, beautiful (before she became a Gorgon and before Sonny went to the House of Representatives--time has surprises, huh?).So, essentially this 80 minutes of dreck is, at best, a dusty and mildewed memory album of, as I said for another recent review, a bygone era.With regards to the Wild on the Beach . . . Bye! Gone?</p>
