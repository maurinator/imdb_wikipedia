<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A posh hotel suite, a gorgeous redhead and a handsome playboy. Slowly she undresses the built young stud, kneeling before him to kiss his ripped six-pack. She goes from worship to service as she pleases him orally and, while they make love, playfully ties his hands -- only to place a pillow over his face. His body shudders -- half climax, half struggle -- until his muscles go limp. The sexy assassin has struck again.This movie, a soft core porn mystery, features Justine Jolie as Layla, a classy hit woman whose trademark killing technique is to seduce her male victim, then slay him when he's most helpless -- at the moment of orgasm. What a way to go. Joli is a beautiful, desirable woman and -- since she's naked in most scenes -- it's easy to see how she could manipulate lustful men. After she snuffs the playboy (played by good looking muscleboy Pete Jenkins) we see her coolly accepting her payment for a job well done.Into this cozy arrangement comes Max, another contract killer who has been given a contract on Layla. Max is played by Jason Sarcinelli. Sarcinelli is a amateur boxer/bodybuilder turned actor whose credits include some action flicks and a number of soft core adult films. It's easy to see him in either -- he's got the Hollywood good looks of a lover boy and the sculpted physique of an action star. He quickly seduces Layla's sexy secretary Serena (Asian-American beauty Michelle Maylene) as a way to get to Layla. Their lovemaking, which starts out with Sarcinelli wearing just a pair of skin tight boxer briefs, goes hot and heavy with Serena clearly ready to switch loyalties. Meanwhile, Damon, who arranges Layla's hits, after paying her for the dead playboy, informs her that he has a new victim lined up. Imagine Layla's surprise when it turns out to be Max. Suspecting something fishy, Layla seduces Damon -- a mysterious, heavily tattooed tough guy -- but lets him climax without taking his life. At the same time, Max is once again putting the moves on Serena, insisting she please him orally before culminating their lovemaking in his bed.It isn't long before Max and Layla call a truce and join forces to discover who has ordered the hits on them. After both admitting to seducing their victims before offing them, Max wants to see her technique. This leads to a bout of steamy lovemaking where Layla shows him that Serena doesn't hold a candle to her oral skills, while he uses his obvious masculinity to drive his point home. As they build to a shuddering climax, Layla carefully maneuvers him into the same position the murdered playboy assumed and then -- when his groans signal a shattering orgasm -- places the pillow over his face, showing him how easy it is for a woman to get the best of a brutal stud like him.A hidden video camera soon reveals that Serena and Damon are the two behind the contracts on Max and Layla. Unbeknownst to them, they are both marked for death by Max and Layla as they secretly watch them making love. Layla will kill the tattooed thug while Max looks forward to making love to -- and slaying -- the lovely Serena. In a long and hot sex scene we see Max practicing Serena's specialty this time, orally servicing her until she is whimpering with desire. Mounting her, he goes slow and hard, bringing her ever closer to what will be her last orgasm. The big hit man can't hold off either and, as they both climax, she screams his name in ecstasy. With a smug grin he then presses the pillow over her beautiful face and, though she struggles, he's far too strong for her and the deed is done.In the last scene Layla, having already taken Damon's life, pours two glasses of champagne while complimenting Max on eliminating Serena using her technique. He tells her he "learned from the best," as these two sexy assassins toast their new partnership.</p>
