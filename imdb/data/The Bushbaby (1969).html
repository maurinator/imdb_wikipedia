<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Bushbaby(1969) 1st watched 8/24/01 - 6 out of 10(Dir-John Trent): Sweet personable story about a young girl who stayed behind in Africa by accident tending to her pet bushbaby while her father leaves on a boat to London.  Good side story with Lou Gossett as a friend who is accussed of kidnapping in the racist-filled South Africa before the local government took over.  Much deeper than most kids movies w/ the cute bushbaby just kind of being a attention-getter for the young audience. Quick unsatisfying ending, but also has mesmerizing cinematography of African animal life.</p>
