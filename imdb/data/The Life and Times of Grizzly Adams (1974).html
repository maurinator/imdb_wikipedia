<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had just purchased a used copy of"The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams" and I had honestly forgotten just how good this movie was. I had last seen this movie when it was first released in 1974, and I was the young and tender age of nine! That was thirty-two years ago. I had forgotten the simple-but-wonderful storyline. The way that you can almost "feel" the wonder of the mountains through the each of the characters,(I always did love Ben.) and the very relaxing acoustic music score. The breathtaking cinematography almost makes you feel like you're there!I whole-heartedly recommend this movie to anyone, and to Hollywood I ask"why can't you make more movies like this"?</p>
