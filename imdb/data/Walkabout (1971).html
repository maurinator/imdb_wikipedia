<h1>Walkabout (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A privileged British family consisting of a mother, a geologist father and an adolescent daughter and son, live in Sydney, Australia. Out of circumstance, the siblings, not knowing exactly where they are, get stranded in the Outback by themselves while on a picnic. They only have with them the clothes on their backs - their school uniforms - some meagre rations of nonperishable food, a battery-powered transistor radio, the son's satchel primarily containing his toys, and a small piece of cloth they used as their picnic drop-cloth. While they walk through the Outback, sometimes looking as though near death, they come across an Australian boy who is on his walkabout, a rite of passage into manhood where he spends months on end on his own living off the land. Their largest problem is not being able to verbally communicate. The boy does help them to survive, but doesn't understand their need to return to civilization, which may or may not happen based on what the Australian boy ends up doing.</p>
<p>After facing a terrible ordeal on the road, a 14 year-old girl and her 6 year-old brother set off into the Australian desert in an attempt to get home. The landscape is bleak with little or no food and water available to them. They meet a young aborigine who is on his walkabout - a coming of age time when 16 year-old boys must set off into the wilderness on their own to show that they can fend for themselves. He speaks no English but they nonetheless manage to communicate and he shows his new companions how to find water. Together manage to survive. As their relationship expands however, it leads to tragedy.</p>
<p>Two young siblings are stranded in the Australian Outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Australian boy on "walkabout": a ritual separation from his tribe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Goodness gracious it's amazing how many reviewers missed the most obvious aspect of the film. This tale is about innocence and it approaches that from many different angles. As for Roeg practicing camera tricks-maybe today these are tricks but at the time the style was a pioneering method of telling and showing psychological elements, wasted on todays audiences. Roeg presents innocence in juxtaposition with the hardness and neuroses of society, not as WHITEMAN BAD but as society, modern society makes us very neurotic by taking away our innocence. Roeg makes an brilliant point and stylizes a mostly nonverbal experience by letting us journey with children all on the cusp of some new stage of growth. This movie is a small masterpiece!!</p>
