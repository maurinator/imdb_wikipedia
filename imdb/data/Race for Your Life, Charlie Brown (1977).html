<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The year was 1977. Dino Dellaurentiis' KING KONG gets "King Cloned". There was a UFO that can communicate with music? We were introduced to STAR WARS. And Charlie Brown is standing up for what he wants, and gets leadership. We finally see CB get into action! And for the first time in the film series, we get to see villains. These 3 bullies are Charles Schultz's answer to The Three Stooges. They have a mean cat with them. And for the first time, we get to hear adult voices. None of this muted trumpet voices like in SNOOPY COME HOME (1972). Sally is whiney, and Peppermint Patty gets to do some democratic business. There are some morals in this film. No one likes a cheater, look before you leap, and no matter how big or small you are, you can do mighty things like winning, plus get tough, and take action. Also never give up until you do. Parents show this film to your kids. This teaches them to be brave, leadership, and get assertive. Now there is something about the cat. He appeared cameo in SNOOPY: THE MUSICAL (1988), but was he The Cat Next Door? Or a speices of cat whose scientific name is "felinius destructivus horribillis". The waterbed sequence with Peppermint Patty and Snoopy was edited into the opening sequence of THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW (1983-1985). It seems to me that watching the Peanuts films is like watching the specials. The closing credits were different form the previous Peanuts films. It looks like something a bit Terry Gilliam-esque, mixed with psychadellic. This film should be released on DVD, with commentary by Lee Mendleson and Bill Millendez, theatrical trailer, TV ads, and when you click on "play movie", you see the 70's "Our Feature Presintation" clip before the picture starts. Plus trailers to other Peanuts films. Or better yet, a box set with the 4 theatrical Peanuts films. I don't to got to camp, because, it is not my gig. I'd rather go to the disco.</p>
