<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>funny thing this movie.it repeats on the space channel a lot, along with another fine b scifi flick "project x", but the funny thing is, whenever it's on, i always fall asleep by the time they have that lame chase on the rooftop of the power plant.  that's 3 times now this year i've missed the ending.whatever.how james cameron got away with ripping this thing off is beyond me. but then again, maybe a lot of people removed it from their resumes.</p>
