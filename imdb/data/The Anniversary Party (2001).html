<p>Celebrity couple Joe and Sally Therrian are going through yet another rough stage in their six-year marriage: while Joe's novels have been climbing higher and higher on the best-seller lists, Sally's film career has been steadily sinking into oblivion. Joe's been given the rights to cast and direct the screenplay of his latest book, but rather than resurrect Sally's career by casting her in the lead role, he's given it to Sally's rival, Skye Davidson. Even worse, he's invited Skye to their anniversary bash. Will the marriage, or anything else for that matter, survive the party?</p>
<p>While celebrating their reconciliation and six years of marriage, the American actress Sally Nash and the British novelist Joe Therrian receive their close friends, some colleagues and their next door neighbors in a party. Under the effect of Ecstasy, revelations are disclosed and relationships deteriorate among the group.</p>
<p>Love is complex and relationships deteriorate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I guess that every once in a while, there has to be a movie about people's relationships about to blow up in everyone's faces - especially if it's about Hollywood. "The Anniversary Party" is one such movie. It has Joe Therrian (Alan Cummings) and Sally Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) throwing a party in their Hollywood Hills house and inviting various friends. As the party continues, it begins more and more to look like everything is about to collapse.This was an okay, if routine, flick. The aspect that really stands out (for me at least) is that real-life couple Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates co-star with their real-life son and daughter. Other cast members include John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Parker Posey. Nothing significant in cinema history, but acceptable.</p>
