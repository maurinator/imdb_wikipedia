<h1>A Hard Day's Night (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Beatles--the world's most famous rock and roll band--travel from their home town of Liverpool to London to perform in a television broadcast. Along the way they must rescue Paul's unconventional grandfather from various misadventures and drummer Ringo goes missing just before the crucial concert.</p>
<p>A day and a half in the life of the Fab Four leading up to a televised concert gig. The boys seem to be constantly on the run - from their crazed fans and from their manager, who is constantly trying to rein them in. Ringo however is arrested and still isn't in the studio half an hour before air time. With Paul's grandfather available for additional comical relief, the group performs a dozen or so songs.</p>
<p>John, Paul, George and Ringo - collectively known as The Beatles - leave their Liverpool home base to head to London where they are to perform on television. There, they have a few official engagements beforehand, such as rehearsals at the studio and a press conference, otherwise they are stuck at the hotel. In addition, they want some free time out just to be lads, which may be difficult seeing as to throngs of adoring and screaming primarily young female fans following them wherever they are known to be. They also encounter a few people who would rather not associate with them because of different sensibilities, a few people who, when seeing only one at a time, wonder if they are who they look to be, and a few people who mistake them for someone else. Sheltered Ringo, in particular, takes advantage of what little freedom they have, which may cause problems for them all in the end. Helping them navigate through all these issues but also ensuring they do their work as celebrities are two of their managers, Norm and Shake, who are accompanying them on this trip and who are having a disagreement about height. Also along for the ride is Paul's paternal grandfather, John McCartney, who Paul's mum believes needs an outing to nurse a broken heart. Despite his outwardly innocent appearance, McCartney Sr. ends up being a mischievous soul, whose misadventures they all have to get him out of time and time again. But at least McCartney Sr. is clean, "very clean"...</p>
<p>A "typical" day in the life of The Beatles, including many of their famous songs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A "typical" day in the life of the Beatles. They have to deal with Paul's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a neurotic TV director (Victor Spinetti), their long-suffering managers and tons of screaming fans.No real plot, just a lot of very lively sequences overflowing with one-liners and non sequiturs. The tone of the scenes go all over the place--one is full of verbal puns, the next visual gags, then absurdity reigns, THEN surrealism! It's a credit to director Richard Lester that he manages to keep all these various shifts in tone flowing smoothly. It's great to see that the Beatles are obviously enjoying themselves every minute. Some of the jokes are obscure (the "clean" jokes were based on remarks made about the Beatles back in 1962) and the accents are sometimes difficult. But it's great to see the Beatles so young and full of life and when they sing the film becomes magical. Also they have a good cast backing them up--Brambell and Spinetti are just great (and very funny). If you don't like the Beatles or their music, you might want to skip this film. But if you do, it's a must-see.</p>
