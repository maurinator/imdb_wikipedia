<h1>Chicago (2012)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bourdain takes on Chicago, the city he deems to be "the only other true American Metropolis." This layover is all about cruising around the diverse neighborhoods that make up this great city in a rented old-school Cadillac. For a bit of off-beat culture, Tony checks out the International Museum of Surgical Science. He drinks in dive bars galore, samples hot dogs, Polish sausages and Italian beef sandwiches (he prefers them hot, sweet and wet), and conducts an informal poll on whether native Chicagoans really eat deep-dish pizza.</p>
