<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was written and directed by a MAN, Lee David Zlotoff, whose only other major film contribution was creating the MacGyver TV series. How could such a MAN convey the deep sensitivity in 'Spitfire Grill'? Percy's boyfriend, the sheriff, and Ely all are portrayed as sensitive and caring MEN.  Isn't it strange that some of the MALE film critics could not feel this film with their hearts?MacGyver director-writer Zlotoff was honest enough to show the faults of MEN, and woman as well. Tremendous care and perception was needed to successfully convey the multi-layered messages in this film. Not only did Zlotoff  do justice to MEN, but to women as well. The themes of Love, Suffering, and the Truth were all superbly enacted.Bravo !</p>
