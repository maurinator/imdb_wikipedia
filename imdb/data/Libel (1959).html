<h1>Libel (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Canadian commercial pilot sees a telecast in London of an interview with Sir Mark Lodden at his home. The Canadian is convinced that the baronet is a fraud, that he is actually a look-alike actor named Frank Welney. The Canadian, the baronet, and the actor were all prisoners in the same German camp during the war and escaped together. One of them disappeared during the escape. Was he Sir Mark or Welney? The tabloids have a field day with the Canadian's accusations and Lady Maggie urges her husband to sue for libel and engage the distinguished barrister Sir Wilfred. The long-drawn-out case is made complex by the fact that Sir Mark himself is not quite sure of his identity. Injured in the war, he stutters on occasion and has difficulty remembering portions of his life. As the evidence sways back and forth in court, it begins to appear that Sir Mark is an impostor and the possible murderer of the missing baronet. Even his wife is convinced of his guilt and turns against him. She denounces him as a stranger who stole her love.</p>
<p>Sir Mark and Lady Margaret Loddon and their adolescent son Michael live in Ingworth House, a grand country estate in the County of Dorset, England. Mark and Maggie were engaged prior to WWII, they having gotten married after the war's end when Mark returned from active duty. Mark is a tortured soul, they believing probably about some repressed memory from the war, when he spent much time in a POW camp. He admits having a spotty memory about much of his life prior to the POW camp. That repressed memory also involves a tune that often runs through his head, he hearing it which is a source of great anxiety. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Buckenham, a Canadian commercial airline pilot on a two day layover in London, sees the couple on television, and is certain that Mark is not who he says he is, but rather a man named Frank Welney. Jeffrey confronts Mark about his fraudulent identity directly, threatening to expose him. Mark admits to recognizing Jeffrey as a friend and fellow prisoner from that POW camp and recognizing the name Frank Welney as another prisoner, but that is all he will admit. To get the story into the public consciousness, Jeffrey takes it to the media, one of the British rags. Although Mark initially wants to ignore the story, he finally decides on Maggie's urging for Michael's sake to sue Jeffrey for libel, which is exactly what Jeffrey was hoping to expose him as truly being Frank Welney. Behind the scenes, Jeffrey is supported by Mark's cousin, Captain Gerald Loddon, a Jaguar car dealer who would have inherited the estate if Mark did not return from war, although he does not want Mark to know that he is working against him. During the course of the trial, Mark, Jeffrey and Frank's story is told, which may finally put together the pieces for Mark about that spotty memory, and the truth whether he is Sir Mark or Frank.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked WWII veteran with memory problems is accused of being an impostor by a former comrade.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I unabashedly admit that Dirk Bogarde is one of my favorite actors, so naturally, two of him is better. In "Libel," directed by Anthony Asquith, he has a dual role - that of a baron, Sir Mark Sebastian Loddon, and Frank Welney, an actor and a lookalike in his barracks during World War II. When Mark returns from the war, he can't remember a lot of his past life and is haunted by images of events during the war that he can't connect with. Another soldier sees the baron on television and believes that he is really Frank Welney, and the story is published in a tabloid. Mark's wife (Olivia de Havilland) insists that for the sake of their young son, he sue for libel. He does.This is an often-told story, but I enjoyed it anyway. Bogarde is excellent as the uptight, insecure Mark and the cocky, nosy Frank, and while there is a strong resemblance between the two men, Welney's coloring and hairstyle is different, as is his manner. De Havilland turns in another marvelous, emotional performance as a woman who starts out believing her husband is indeed the man she loved before the war... and then having her doubts.Well directed and holds one's interest.</p>
