<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you love stupid comedy this movie is DEFINITELY for you!  Animal House, Super Troopers, & The Blues Brothers.  If you liked these movies you'll love Strange Brew.  It's classic!  A MUST SEE!!!  Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas make an awesome team of crazy Canadian brothers, or should I say "hosers", eh?  The plotline is kinda sketchy, but then again, the movie isn't exactly made for a great plotline.  It's made for the comedy.  Made in 1983 and it still kicks some royal butt!  So sit back and enjoy as the two "hosers" bumble their way to some crazy times!</p>
