<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was attracted to this one by the presence of David Niven, always a plus, and I was not disappointed. This is by no means a great movie but it's a very good one in all departments - script, plot line, tension, character development, acting and cinematography (gloriously crisp b&w). In addition to Niven, as a flawed idealist, there is Leslie Caron as his long- suffering wife, James Robertson Justice as a cynical manager and David Opatoshu as a deposed president. Events circle around a revolution in a fictional South American country, as a couple whose relationship is foundering get involved with the fate of the wounded, deposed president, and try to spirit him out of the country. There is plenty of tension in the escape sequences, as they are hunted by the federates, but we also see developments in the relationship of Niven's and Caron's couple. The film tried to make the point that the complexities of life do not always make for black and white, idealistic choices, that we are at some level all flawed. All in all a very good film that deserves more attention.</p>
