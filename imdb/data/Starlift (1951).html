<h1>Starlift (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Air Force fliers Rick Williams and Mike Nolan attempt to meet film star Nell Wayne, with whom Rick shares a hometown but not much else. Fellow film stars Doris Day and Ruth Roman mistakenly believe Rick to be very close to Nell and arrange for him to meet her. The pair begin to form a match, especially after Nell, Doris, and Ruth arrange for Hollywood stars to perform for G.I.s in transit to and from the Korean War, at Travis Air Base. But Nell thinks Rick is getting ready to ship out to the war, when in reality, he and Mike ferry troops part of the way then return to Travis Air Base with returning soldiers. Nell is furious with Rick for letting her believe he was headed to a war zone, especially because the press has made a huge story of their romance. Meantime, a new program, Operation Starlift, has been set in place by the Air Force and the Hollywood studios, whereby stars are flown to San Francisco to perform for the outbound and inbound troops. Movie stars such as Randolph Scott, Phil Harris, and Jane Wyman pitch in to entertain the troops. Rick volunteers for duty in a combat zone, and Nell begins to think she's been wrong about him.</p>
<p>A cavalcade of movie stars are in San Francisco for a world movie premiere. Because of a chance meeting with a couple of air force men, some of those movie stars, including Doris Day and Ruth Roman, head to Travis Air Force Base outside of the city. Seeing life of the enlisted men heading off to the Korean War, the movie stars decide to visit with the returning wounded men and put on a show at the base. This one show becomes an on-going mission for the Hollywood community, coined Operation Starlift. Meanwhile, there is a budding romance between one of those air force men, Cpl. Rick Williams, and one of the movie stars, Nell Wayne, the two who grew up in the same small town. Their meeting and romance is predicated on a white lie told by Rick's friend, Sgt. Mike Nolan, the lie fostered by the corporal. The romance could be in jeopardy if Nell and/or the world, who know of the story through the Hollywood gossip machine, learn the truth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Actress Ruth Roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump-started this all-star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny Air Force Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle). Seems the Corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew, flying to and from Honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way, but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies). Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant. Roman is also here, looking glamorous, while James Cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Jane Wyman sings, too, in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day's lead, causing one to wonder, "Did they run out of sets?" For undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. Still, the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render "Starlift" strictly a second-biller. *1/2 from ****</p>
