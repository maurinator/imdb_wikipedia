<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A bourgeois couple, modern yet conventional. One night by accident, a young prostitute barges into their lives. Hounded down, beaten up, threatened, she will continue to struggle, with the help of a well off lady, first for her survival-her resurrection-then for her dignity and freedom. Stormy encounters for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Malika, a young prostitute, is badly molested in the street by her pimp in front of Paul and Hélène, a well-off couple, carefully hidden in their car. Against all odds, Hélène leaves her husband and family behind to go to the hospital and take care of Malika, who lies in a coma. The mission Hélène assigned herself: to help Malika have a new life and, above all, to take her out of her molesters' claws...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What impressed me more than anything about "Chaos" was the energetic acting.  The two female leads seem absolutely driven in their portrayals, and it's a good thing, because their characters need all the energy they can get to cope with the whirlwind of savagery and plot twists in this terrifically entertaining (though sometimes hard to watch) film.The only thing I disliked in "Chaos" was the cardboard portrayal of the husband.  Though I consider myself a Francophile and have long enjoyed French films, I find French farce heavy-handed and really hard to take--and this role was handled farcically.  But that's perhaps a cultural quibble, and overall I was greatly impressed by the film.Highly recommended, but not for the squeamish.</p>
