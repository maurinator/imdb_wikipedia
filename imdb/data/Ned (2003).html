<h1>Ned (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A comedy based on the rise and fall of Ned Kelly and his gang of Outlaws.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I decided to watch Ned after repeatedly watching his satire on the Matrix, titled "Computer Boy". Although Ned isn't the greatest comedy out I have to say I quite enjoyed this film as it is consistent Abe Forsythe's style of humour ( I loved the cameo from "Hey Dad"). A good film to go watch when it is out on DVD.</p>
