<h1>The Marrying Kind (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Florence and Chet Keefer have had a troublesome marriage. Whilst in the middle of a divorce hearing the judge encourages them to remember the good times they have had hoping that the marriage can be saved.</p>
<p>Chet Keefer and Florrie Keefer n√©e Derringer are in front of Judge Anne B. Carroll, who is in the middle of hearing their divorce petition. At the end of the day's proceedings which are to be continued the next morning, the judge asks to see the couple in her chambers without their lawyers. Sensing that their marriage can be saved by what she has seen and heard thus far, the judge changes roles to unofficial marriage counselor without telling them her plan. In Chet and Florrie talking openly and candidly about their life together which admittedly has had its up and downs, the downs complete with tragedy, the judge, who believes the adage "there are three sides to every story: yours, his and the truth", hopes that they can get to the truth by at least seeing the rationale and/or perspective of other's version of the story, with the goal that she can take their case off tomorrow morning's docket.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The dizzy title of this film might suggest a screwball comedy, but it's deceptive. Despite claims to the contrary, this is definitely not a screwball comedy. It starts with plenty of jokes and humorous moments, but among other things, the pacing is all wrong. Also, screwballs often involve moneyed folk with big houses and good accents, and these are working-class characters in a small and under-furnished apartment. Knocking a few drinks back is an amusing foible in screwballs: here it usually complicates the lives of the characters. Instead of driving places, they take the bus or feel guilty about spending money on cabs. Screwball couples may have a pet dog or a leopard in tow; how many of them have small children (as here) whose sleep is interrupted by the bitter arguments of their parents? This might even be called anti-screwball.The unevenness of tone certainly disconcerted me the first time I saw it, and it has clearly worried several of the other people who've commented on the film. Though Judy Holliday is great (as usual), it helps an appreciation of the film if one does not expect a replay of Born Yesterday's raucous laughter or even the gentler-paced humour of Bells Are Ringing.Scenes of the discordance and trials of married life are played for laughs, but with an increasingly harder edge until the comedy has very nearly been wrung out of the whole thing. Slowly, the humour departs from the story and we're left with a very watchable study of a marriage spiralling into crisis, even if the treatment does become rather soapy at times.After several viewings of this strange film, I'm still not sure if I've enjoyed the experience, though I constantly feel that I've been watching something significant. I can't give it a score, as I really don't know how to estimate an accurate score. It's worth seeing, even if you don't expect to like it: that's the only way I can summarise it.</p>
