<h1>Ecce bombo (1978)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me start by stating that this is a superbly intelligent and funny film which enlists among it protagonists the medium by occasionally 'pointing' to its delivery technique/style. A sharp social commentary picture, delivered with humour and satire; a synthesis of some of Italy's trends and moods at the end of the 1970s; the voice of one of its embedded protagonist who observes and reflects on cultural issues and society in general and how they affect his generation (e.g. cigarette corporations ads and movies). The language barrier can be dealt with in fact it was very well received and appreciated by the European viewership and nominated for the Palm d'Or, the highest honour at the Cannes Film Festival. As for the role of the 'reader': the viewer, whatever his or her origins and background, could reflect on the history of his or her country, its economic developments/corporate influence, its educational policies, its social fears and/or generational angst, its mid-late nineteenth century dilemmas. Subsequently, the latter can be compared to those of other countries, in this case to Italy's and how they are depicted in Moretti's rendition in ECCE BOMBO. The findings can be enlightening and have much to say about the dynamics of the relationship between the individual and his or her community in their own country, the social milieu he or she inhabits and how they affect each other. This 1978 classic of world cinema is definitely an entertaining and astute 'study' of society which the medium of the cinema affords.</p>
