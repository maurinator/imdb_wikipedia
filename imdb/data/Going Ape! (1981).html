<h1>Going Ape! (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When his father - who owned a circus - dies, Foster inherits 5 million dollars - and 3 orangutans. However there's a condition connected to the money: if he gives away the orangutans or just one gets sick or dies during the next 3 years, the zoological society will get all the money. So he not only has to deal with 3 apes and an annoyed girlfriend, but also with Laszlo, a kooky new roommate who came from the circus to help with the apes, a greedy zoological society's president, 3 bumbling henchmen and a cranky landlord.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow. It seems like if you see this movie, you will either absolutely hate it, or absolutely love it! The movie had an interesting dynamic. It was hard to determine exactly what category this movie was meant for. It seemed to be targeted more towards kids with all of the high-jinks and buffoonery, but then there was far too much swearing in it to let kids watch.I let my 10 and 8 year old brother and sister watch it, and they loved it! I watched it for Tony Danza, who was still very green at the time, but still managed to pull it off. Danny DeVito was brilliant, like always, and I would recommend you keep an open mind if you plan on watching this movie.</p>
