<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frankie Machine is a skilled card dealer and one-time heroin addict. When he returns home from jail, he struggles to find a new livelihood and to avoid slipping back into addiction.</p>
<p>Frankie Machine is no sooner back in his old neighborhood after a 6 month stint in prison and rehab than his old drug dealer, Louie is after him to restart his old drug habit. Frankie will have nothing to with him, proudly declaring that he is drug free and has no intention of letting that monkey get on his back ever again. Before going to prison he was a card dealer but learned to play the drums and now has hopes of becoming a professional musician. It's going to be a struggle however. His wife Zosch, clinging and wheelchair-bound and his old gambling boss, Schwiefka, stress him to the point that he soon falls back into his old drug habit. The girl he really loves, Molly, stands by him through thick and thin but when Louie is killed, the police believe Frankie is the man responsible and go after him.</p>
<p>Junkie Frankie Machine has just returned to his north-side Chicago neighborhood after a six month incarceration. He took the fall as the dealer for Schwiefka's raided illegal high stakes poker game, Schwiefka who in turn promised to take care of Frankie's wife, Sophia - who everyone calls Zosh - while Frankie was in prison for Frankie not talking. For three years, Zosh has been in a wheelchair, the result of a car accident caused by Frankie, the guilt associated which led to Frankie marrying her, despite he now being in love with a young woman named Molly, a strip club hostess, who lives downstairs in their tenement building. While in prison, Frankie became clean and learned how to play the drums, which he hopes will lead to a drug-free life on the outside as a union-carded musician. Dealing for Schwiefka, especially in high pressure all night games, exacerbated his need for drugs to remain on the edge during the games. Louie, Frankie's drug supplier, knows this, he who works in unofficial collaboration as the senior partner with Schwiefka. Despite Schwiefka and Louie trying to lure Frankie back into his old life, Frankie believes he can steer clear of that life. However, with their maneuvering, it may make it more difficult than Frankie imagines. But what Frankie may be unaware of is that the biggest obstacle to his staying clean in a literal and figurative sense is Zosh, who is keeping a secret all in an effort to hang on to Frankie and not have him leave her for specifically Molly.</p>
<p>A strung-out junkie deals with a demoralizing drug addiction while his crippled wife and card sharks pull him down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sinatra is thoroughly convincing as the addict in this grim horror story of what life is like for someone who has lost his soul to drugs. This is film noir made even more noir by the drab sets and lighting. We go through the terrifying experience of a man who is trying to escape from the monster he has placed on his own back.Elmer Bernstein's score is a mixture of jazz and symphony that makes the addict's frightful journey even more believable to the audience.This film opened the topic of drug addiction the way LOST WEEKEND broached the subject of alcoholism. At least people could talk about these addictions a little more freely.</p>
