<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A totally independent film shot in Boston and Cambridge. My memory is a little hazy about the plot (I saw it over 20 years ago) but here's what I remember:A young woman (Harrington) lives in the projects but dreams of a better life. Her best friend is a black girl her age. One night she witnesses a murder and recognizes the killer...but he's either the boyfriend or brother of her best friend. She tells the police and he's arrested but it tears apart her friendship. Did she do the right thing?Film explores being a teenager, racial relationships, growing up in the Cambridge projects in the late 70s, truth vs. friendship all in realistic, believable ways. All the acting is excellent and it makes great use of some Cambridge landmarks--it's amusing to see a bunch of the girls go to Faces nightclub which was closed in the early 80s (but it's still standing!).I caught this on local TV in 1979 (it didn't get a full blown release until 1981) and never forgot it. It dealt with an issue (racism) that existed in Cambridge back then but was never really acknowledged. Also it was great seeing places I recognized and hung out at on TV.Good luck finding a print of this--it hasn't played anywhere since 1981!</p>
