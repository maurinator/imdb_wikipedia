<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An appealing caper movie with an all-star cast. Fred Astaire is mischievous as a longtime British Secret Service man perennially passed over for knighthood. Disappointed again, he masterminds a plan to steal gold bullion on an airplane. He cons ex-Ivy League professor Richard Crenna & Anne Heywood, jet setex-wife of Jacques Sernas to help him recruit a gang of thieves. With good guys Ralph Richardson & Roddy McDowall, bad guys Cesar Romero & Adolfo Celi.Filmed in London and Italy. Delightful music by Elmer Bernstein with AnneHeywood performing the title song. Directed by actor Alf Kjellin.</p>
