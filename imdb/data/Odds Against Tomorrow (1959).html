<h1>Odds Against Tomorrow (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dave Burke is looking to hire two men to assist him in a bank raid: Earle Slater, a white ex-convict, and Johnny Ingram, a black gambler. Both are reluctant; but Burke arranges for Ingram's creditors to put pressure on him, while Slater feels humiliated by his failure to provide for his girlfriend; they eventually accept. But Slater loathes and despises blacks, and the tensions in the gang rapidly mount.</p>
<p>In New York, the former cop Dave Burke summons the veteran Earle Slater and the jazz musician Johnny Ingram to heist a bank in a small town. Slater is financially supported by his woman Lorry and feels uncomfortable with the situation. Johnny is a compulsive gambler and owes a large amount to the shark Bacco, who is threatening his ex-wife and his daughter. They both are reluctant to accept the invitation, but they need money and accept to participate in Burke's plan. However Slater is racist and does not trust in Johnny.</p>
<p>Dave Burke hires two very different debt-burdened men for a bank robbery. Suspicion and prejudice threaten to end their partnership.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Oscar-winning director Robert Wise ("West Side Story", "The Sound of Music") directs Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, Shelley Winters and Ed Begley to masterful performances in this grounbreaking, revelatory film.  Earl Slater (Ryan) is a bigoted small-time petty thief with a supportive but hapless live-in lover (Winters).  Johnny Ingram (Belafonte) is a down on his luck hustler/drummer who gets involved with a bank robbery scheme with Dave Burke (Begley).  Slater is also in on the heist, but must come to terms with his racist views with Ingram in order to pull off the plan.  This is an incredibly clear-eyed, no holds barred look at the kind of segregation that was alive at the time, with superb performances by all, including Gloria Grahame as Ryan and Winters' love-starved neighbor, Helen, and Kim Hamilton as Belafonte's ex-wife, Ruth.  The film dosen't resort to theatrics to build its tension; that comes naturally, due to excellent ensemble work by the cast, a great jazz score by John Lewis and Joseph C. Brun's gritty camerawork.  An influential, brilliant film, not to be missed.  ***1/2</p>
