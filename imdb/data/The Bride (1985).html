<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't see this as a remake of _Bride of Frankenstein_ at all.  In _Bride of Frankenstein_ the bride is created, rejects the idea of being the monster's mate, and is brought down together with monster, maker, and laboratory.  That happens here too, but it's only the beginning and the movie mostly gives us the further adventures of the trio after they have picked themselves up and dusted themselves off.  The bride on the one hand is groomed to be a woman who can achieve anything but is unaware of her origin, though she is does find an ossuary a fascinating place to be.  The monster on the other hand is all too aware of his origin but unaware of his potential as a human being.  This makes an interesting contrast, but mostly the film is just more of the James Whale sort of thing, for people who like that sort of thing.  It's respectful, not exploitative, but not ground-breaking either.</p>
