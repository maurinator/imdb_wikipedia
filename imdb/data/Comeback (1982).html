<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just one more waste of Eric Burdon's fabulous talent.This is the most schlockey film I have ever seen, considering it features Eric Burdon, who in my opinion is history's greatest singer, (and who is also potentially one of the world's finest natural actors, and a perpetually cool dude.) Now, Eric, I was always your number 1 fan, my man. You even influenced my entire career. I have always said that you have been largely underused and undercredited for a person of your enormous impact on the world.But this film lacks momentum, direction, or even a shred of decency. The theme was a great idea, that of the fading rock star making a comeback. All the songs in the film are superb, except for some that I found unusually vulgar. If Eric had stuck with his great voice, deep soul, and vividly creative lyrics, he would not have need to resort to smutty songs to make a point.The photography is actually quite good, with consistent quality filming, lighting, balance, etc. But there are long scenes that make little sense, as if someone forgot to turn off the camera.One redeeming feature is Eric's tender expressions of love toward his little daughter in the film. I did not know that side of him, and was glad to see it.Eric deserves a grander vehicle for showcasing his immeasurable talent. I couldn't even tell at whom this film was directed: it seems to start out in the gutter and wants to die there, with gutter snipes. What about Eric's vast audience of decent movie-going and song-digging people? They were not considered when this tripe was made.For the first time in my life, I have to turn away from a work by my lifelong hero, Eric Burdon.</p>
