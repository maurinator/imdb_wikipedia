<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This sort of innocent-shy-guy-finds-a-girl (or innocent-shy-girl-finds-a-guy) shtick has been done before, and better. This laughless but somewhat watchable comedy drifts into many sub-plots, a lot of them not particularly interesting, and gets occasionally soppy even. The lead character is okay, and Horrocks is the only bright spot in a largely bland cast. Some characterizations are messy and too clich√©d, for example Bonham-Carter's. She is 23 here, but she looks not a day older than 14. (In fact, she looks so much like Billy Armstrong, the man-boy singer from Green Day.) She actually shows her breasts here - a pitiful pair, indeed; no wonder she does costume dramas, and not thrillers where she'd get screwed all over the furniture by Michael Douglas. As an actress she is overrated - not a common thing with British actors, who are generally very good. But getting into show-biz was easy for her - her grandfather was the British Prime Minister(!) and her uncle a director; under such circumstances a girl need not have either a presentable pair of boobs or more than average talent.If you want to see my detailed "TV & Cinema: The 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism" list, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8For an even more unpopular IMDb comment, check out my "Planet of the Apes" review (0 out of 178).</p>
