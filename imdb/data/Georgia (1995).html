<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film started off with a certain amount of promise. Interesting cast, good production values, et cetera. Mare Winningham was good, as her Oscar nomination testifies to. Jennifer Jason Leigh was good, also, but in an intensely dislikeable way. Not her fault, it was written that way. Ms. Winningham showed off her pipes as well as her acting chops, but Ms. Leigh was playing a singer with basically no ear, who's ambition to sing was all to emulate her sister. I have no idea if Ms. Leigh can sing or not, but if so, it must have been tough to play a character who could not, but tried to (in public!) constantly.But the character's struggle with addiction made my mind wander. It has been done to death, and the arc is always the same. Eventually the movie bored me, the cardinal sin of cinema.</p>
