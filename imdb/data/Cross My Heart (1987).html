<h1>Cross My Heart (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man and a woman go out on a "big" third date. He's ashamed to admit he just lost his job, and she's afraid he'll run away if he finds out that she has a kid. Small lies lead to bigger ones and the night gets crazy very soon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I rented this movie I thought aww man Reisers gonna flub it up.  But I was was wrong it's simply magical and shows how real dates go instead of all these yuppie movies made by one hit wonders. Reiser is very good O'toole is charming and Short is Amazing (as always).   See it!</p>
