<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Most reviewers forget that they are watching a movie made in India in 1958 and that too in black and white. To see it with FX-laden tinted glasses would be do do a disservice to the makers and the actors. regardless of the overall delivery of the film. Though even today ( and i must have seen this movie 10 times already ) you shudder at the thought of Pran in the empty large house, you creep at the surreal lighting, you rejoice at the music and its uplifting raw tribal rhythm, and how you wish you had the panache of Dilip Kumar or the grace of a Madhubala. The plot keeps you in your grip while the music and the acting are a feast for your senses. So should you see it ? - if you appreciate good cinema, this is a treat. But remember it belongs to a time, when films, like people used to take their time to unfold and once open would invite you into their arms and never let you go. As a tribute to the masters and a tongue in cheek to Bollywoods plagiarist accusations - the recent Blockbuster of 2007, OM Shanti OM, has lifted its Climax totally from this film. Go Check.</p>
