<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fine, harshly realistic Don Siegel film from the late 60's with Richard Widmark superb as Madigan.  Steve Ihnat (from THE CHASE) is also a perfect twisted and aggressive villain with able support from Harry Guardino.  The lovely Inger Stevens is touching in one of her last roles before her untimely demise.  A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Steve Ihnat (who died too young).  Don Siegel made a lot of good films and this is near the top of the list.  One of the pro-cop films before Dirty Harry blasted it open.  Once again, Inger Stevens will break your heart near the end of this and she never looked more beautiful in her all too short career.  Well worth anyone's time.</p>
