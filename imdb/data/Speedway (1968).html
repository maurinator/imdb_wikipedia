<h1>Speedway (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Elvis Presley sings his way around the race circuit as successful speedway driver Steve Grayson. All is fine and dandy until the tax return submitted by a wise-cracking Bill Bixby (as Steve's manager) is scrutinised by the IRS. Will Elvis be able to raise the $145,000 to pay his tax bill? Will he succeed with his advances to IRS inspector Nancy Sinatra? Will the songs get any worse? Well, you didn't expect the likes of Hamlet did you?</p>
<p>Poor bookkeeping saddles stock car driver Steve Grayson with a huge bill for back taxes which hampers his ability to continue racing competitively.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>SPEEDWAY, Elvis and Nancy Sinatra tackle the fast pace of the Charlotte Speedway and light up the screen. Nancy looks fantastic with her blonde hair and those incredible eyes that melt you. Elvis is Elvis, what can you say. NOTE: Nancy is the only person to ever have a song included on an Elvis Presley soundtrack. YOUR GROOVY SELF is fun and the attitude lively. Gale Gordon adds to the cast as does Bill Bixby.Fast cars, groovy times and lots of songs. The children in this movie are adorable.True entertainment for Elvis and Nancy fans alike.Grab the pop corn and snuggle up!</p>
