<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After the death of his wife Detective Tyler Roman has lost his sense of direction. A once great police detective, he now confronts no visible career path at all. A call from an old time friend on the police force seeking his assistance finally gets Tyler's directional path somewhat back on track. Not wanting to take on the case, but lacking financial stability, he is resigned to taking this 14 year old unsolvable case. Dreading the thought the moment he accepted the assignment, he soon starts back up where he left off two years earlier; partnering up with his long time friend and partner, police lab technician & computer whiz Dezirae Cassini. They quickly find themselves plunging deep into the world of this unknown criminal mind responsible for 95% of all jewelery heists in the city, only to unravel something that Tyler wished had never been revealed.</p>
