<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A solid, well-to-do flick, "Hoodlum" is a good film trying tolive up the dying genre of the 1930's gangster flick. LaurenceFishburne is in top form as Bumpy, an ex-con from Sing Sing whobecomes a big time ganglord in Harlem. While not tacklingenemies such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) and Lucky Luchiano(Andy Garcia), Bumpy romances his girl Francine (the fineVanessa Williams). Packed with machine gun-toting violence,"Hoodlum" has the cool style of modern day crime thrillers suchas "New Jack City" and the sneering Al Caponeish look of the oldstyle</p>
