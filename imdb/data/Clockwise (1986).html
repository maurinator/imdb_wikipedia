<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brian Stimpson is the headmaster of a comprehensive (high) school in England. He sets himself, his staff and pupils very high standards. On the way to a conference at which he is to talk, all manner of disasters strike.</p>
<p>A fastidious time-keeper headmaster Brian Stimpson allows plenty of time for his train journey to a heads' conference but unfortunately gets on the wrong train and misses his connection, as a result commandeering a car driven by sixth former Laura to take him there. They are pursued by Stimpson's wife Gwenda who, whilst taking three old ladies out for a drive, is mystified at seeing her husband with a young girl and gives suspicious chase. On the way Stimpson encounters old flame Pat, who is also dragged into helping him beat his deadline but when the car is destroyed he and Laura have to rob a salesman of his vehicle. Stimpson eventually arrives at the conference in a bedraggled state, followed by his wife and her charges and the police, who arrest him for car theft.</p>
<p>An obsessively punctual comprehensive school headmaster sets out to give an important speech at the annual Headmasters' Conference.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A much underrated comedy detailing the collapse of a stern, disciplinarian headmaster during a chaotic journey to deliver a speech at a convention of snobbish educationists.Cleese begins in a very restrained way and is watchable and funny as he gradually descends into anarchic despondency.  The pathos as he finally delivers his speech, in an ill-fitting (stolen) tasteless outfit, surrounded by the detritus of his dreadful day, is  genuinely moving as well as funny.Best line, from Cleese, as yet another possible means of reaching his goal emerges: 'It's not the despair: I can cope with the despair.  It's the HOPE that's what's killing me.'  Almost the perfect motto for Scotlandfootball supporters, you might say.Probably alone in the world, I rate this movie superior to the overly foul-mouthed and Americanised Fish Called Wanda.  A host of grizzled British character actors, including the magnificent Alison Steadman, keep things going.I wonder what happened to the sherry glasses?</p>
