<h1>Picture Mommy Dead (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Teenaged Susan Shelley is released from an asylum where she's been confined to after the shock suffered over the fiery death of her glamorous socialite mother. Her father has a new wife, who has only married him for the money left to him by Zsa Zsa. Susan is still haunted by her mother's memory, and her step-mother is conspiring with her lover, Maxwell Reed, to trick the troubled girl to lead them to Zsa Zsa's missing diamond necklace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Martha Hyer, Don Ameche, and Zsa Zsa Gabor in a horror film?-- It's definitely cult material.   The three stars give unusually good performances for this type of film, with the rest of the cast over and under-acting.  Truly an unusual horror film, the plot of this haunted mansion-whodunit isn't as predictable as it would seem.  It's hard to find, but worth it.</p>
