<h1>Dakota Incident (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A number of people are waiting for the stage to Laramie. Some are anxious to get there and are willing to bribe the stationmaster for tickets on the sold-out run. When the stage arrives bristling with Cheyenne arrows in it (as well as in the passengers), space becomes available and some brave souls set out on the coach. Attacked by Indians, the horses run off, the coach is burned and the survivors take refuge in a dry gully. One by one the Indians and the passengers pick each other off, until thirst and exhaustion take their toll on the three people left.</p>
<p>Indians attack a stagecoach, and a disparate band of passengers must band together to fight them off.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very tedious Western, made even more tedious by the fact that it uses the sort of scenery that makes the better Westerns.It's Anglos against Native Americans. The characters are pitiful clich√©s, especially the two leads. You keep hoping for something fresh here, but you don't get anything fresh.The scenery is there. The costumes are "entertainment" based. This should have been a good movie. But it becomes too predicable in the usual Hollywood "lets make everything as depressing as possible and see how many people we can drive to suicide." It's more of a war monger Western than one usually sees, though not to the sickening scale of "Arrowhead", which stands alone as the "sickest Western ever". Still, this one is an embarrassment to all involved. And when the bland Dale Robertson finds a character even more stereotyped than usual, it's time to fire some writers and directors.In an era of great Westerns, this one stands out as one of the worst.</p>
