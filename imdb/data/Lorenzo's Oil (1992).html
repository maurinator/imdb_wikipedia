<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Until about the age of 7, Lorenzo Odone was a normal child. After then, strange things began to happen to him: he would have blackouts, memory lapses, and other strange mental phemonenons. He is eventually diagnosed as suffering from ALD: an extremely rare incurable degenerative brain disorder. Frustrated at the failings of doctors and medicine in this area, the Odones begin to educate themselves in the hope of discovering something which can halt the progress of the disease.</p>
<p>A boy develops a disease so rare that nobody is working on a cure, so his father decides to learn all about it and tackle the problem himself.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>LORENZO'S OIL (1992) **** Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon, Peter Ustinov, Zack O' Malley Greenburg, Kathleen Wilhoite.  Powerful and educational true life story of Augusto and Michaela Odone who learn their young son is stricken with a devestating and rare disease (adrenoleukodystrophy or ALD) with no cure.  The parents take on the awesome task of finding hope when doctors and support groups won't make an effort in learning how to conquer their son's debilitating nerve disorder.  Although there are some distrubingly realistic depictions of a child suffering, the film never insults or preaches, but instead, enlightens.  Sarandon, in my opinion was cheated out of an Oscar (she lost to Emma Thompson for "Howard's End"), gives the performance of her career and Nolte is wonderful as the frustrated father who risks everything in his research odyssey.  Effectively directed by George Miller ("Mad Max") who also has a degree as a doctor (!)</p>
