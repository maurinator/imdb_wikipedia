<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't know I was missing something until I saw this movie. Ram gopal verma has changed his genre often from love triangle, crime, horror and documentary but Rangeela has a special place among them. Urmila was seduction personified, she danced live a swan while great styling and cinematography added to the charm. Amir khan showed his early shades of tapoori(low-life bum) acting in this movie which was funny at the same time heart warming, later he acted in Ghulam on the similar lines. Jackie can't dance but this is more than compensated by his acting. Another aspect of the movie are songs and their execution which is even more pleasing to watch than the movie itself. I must watch for any Hindi movie buff and also for a peek into early works for Ram Gopal verma.</p>
