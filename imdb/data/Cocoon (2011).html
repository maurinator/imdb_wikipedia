<h1>Cocoon (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Officer Huckiss, a short tempered Texas Sheriff, uses his cowboy logic to recklessly defeat a race of condescending, cocoon dwelling critters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As Theo mentions (sigh, always in his shadow!) it is notable that the only American to make a comment here seems to have come away with the fact that this film is a comment on gun control (one way or the other), whereas the Scot and Norn Irishman got something different. To me this rough and tumble short is very much a spoof on the typical American sci- fi film where the outsiders are ultimately beaten back by American might, which comes in the form of jingoistic freedom and a large amount of hardware. I couldn't help but think of Independence Day and other similar films where the American military and the frontier spirit are the two main things to make the difference.This animation takes that to extremes as it sees the good ol' boy sheriff doing his talking with his piece and his hands. By making it deliberately excessive and comical, the short film works because it actually is never a million miles from being similar to the content of a "proper" film  or at least in terms of the general theme and flow. The animation is very nicely done with great figures and movement throughout  it looks so good that to be honest it becomes normal and I watched this a second time just so I could ignore the content and focus on how well it moved and looked.The short is a bit blunt perhaps but it is still quite amusing and I enjoyed its dig at the US self-image in movies and its own culture; it is affectionate but still funny.</p>
