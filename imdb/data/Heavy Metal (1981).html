<h1>Heavy Metal (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A sweeping story of the battle of good against evil is told through an anthology of short animated films about a glowing green orb (the Loc-Nar) that is the personification of ultimate evil in the universe. Based loosely on the American magazine "Heavy Metal," and the French magazine "MÃ©tal Hurlant".</p>
<p>This movie is based on an American Comic Book of the same name. This movie is an anthology based around a green orb (Loc-Nar) which is the sum of all evil. The segments in order are: "Soft Landing"; "Grimandi"; "Harry Canyan"; "Den"; "Capain Sternn"; "B-17"; "So Beautiful, So Dangerous"; "Taarna". "Den" is based on Richard Corben's Hero that appeared in Heavy Metal magazine during 1977 (the magazine's first year). It is also available in paperback from Fantagor Press. "So Beautiful, So Dangerous" is based on a serial in Heavy Metal magazine (later a book). "Soft Landing" originally appeared in the September 1979 issue of the comic book "Captain Sternn" was written Berni Wrightson and appeared in the June 1890 edition on the comic. "Grimandi" is the wrap-around story that evolves from "Soft Landing".</p>
<p>An astronaut brings home a glowing green orb for his daughter. However, the orb kills him and corners the girl for its purposes. Claiming to the embodiment of all evil, the malevolent sphere, known as the Loc-Nar, terrorizes the little girl by showing a series of bizarre and fantastic tales it has influenced. The first is "Harry Canyon," a cynical taxi driver in a squalid futuristic New York who finds himself involved with a damsel in distress who is relentlessly pursued by murderous thugs who desire the Loc-Nar her archaeologist father found. The second is "Den" which chronicles the adventures of a nerdish boy who is thrown into the fantasy world of Neverwhere, where he is transformed into a studly naked muscle-man, desired by beautiful women, who must get involved in a conflict revolving around possession of the Loc-Nar. The third is "Captain Sternn" where the title character is a handsome but irredeemable scoundrel who stands accused in a trial that Loc-Nar throws into chaos. The fourth is "B-17", where a World War II bomber plane limps home after a bombing run, only to have the Loc-Nar ram into it and revive the dead crew members as murderous zombies. The next is "So Beautiful, So Dangerous" where a buxom secretary at the Pentagon is abducted by stoned alien wastrels and a oversexed robot. The final story is "Taarna", where the Loc-Nar has to come to a future Earth and changes a peaceful people into a horde of murderous barbarians who rampage with genocidal zeal. Only the last Tarackian, a silent swords-woman known as Taarna, can avenge the victims and stop the Loc-Nar.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Heavy Metal, the movie, is great encapsulation of Heavy Metal, the magazine. Heavy Metal was and is an anthology of the best of American and European comic writers and artists.  It has carried the work of such masters as Moebius, Druillet, Liberatore, Bernie Wrightson, Howard Chaykin, Walt Simonson, Arthur Sydam, Enki Bilal, Richard Corben and Simon Bisley.  The movie adapts some of the great stories from the glory days of the magazine.The movie is much like the magazine: a mixed bag of sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy, and erotica.  Some of it is good, some not.  My personal favorites are Harry Canyon, Den, Captain Sternn, B-17, and Tarna.  Harry Canyon is a sci-fi tale of thugs, femme fatales, and cynics ala Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, transported to the future.  It has been cited as an inspiration for The Fifth Element, by some; but it bears some resemblance to the works of French artist, Moebius, who created designs for The Fifth Element.  Moebius also factors into Tarna, as the entire look of this sequence is almost xeroxed from Moebius' Arzach stories.Captain Sternn is the anti-hero/criminal from Bernie Wrightson, co-creator of Swamp Thing and illustrator of a beautiful edition of Frankenstein. This is a fun sequence, full of comedy and chaos, much like the Sternn stories. Sternn has more than a slight resemblance to a certain Kryptonian.B-17 captures the flavor of the old EC horror comics, like Tales from the Crypt and the Vault of Horror.  The sequence features design work from Mike Ploog, a horror comics master and artist of Marvel's Man-Thing. It has a nice creepy, decayed atmosphere and lets the visuals tell the story.Den is adapted from Richard Corben's tales.  The melon-breasted women that Corben is known for are on fine display here.  We also get the humor that also permeates Corben's work.  John Candy was quite good here, giving Den the perfect adolescent voice.Tarna is the most lush sequence, with sweeping vistas and the use of rotoscoping for the character.  It is also quite violent.  Again, it owes a great deal to Moebius' Arzach.So Beautiful, So Dangerous is pretty forgettable, with juvenile humor and boring animation.  Soft Landing is fairly pointless, except to serve as a title sequence.  The whole linking device is unnecessary, as the segments bear little relation to one another and are stronger as separate entities. The soundtrack is great, with most pieces capturing the flavor of the animation.Ultimately, the uneven stories and lower budget animation holds this movie back.  The movie is best viewed as an anthology, rather than a complete story, and with a forgiving eye to the budget.  With that said, it's still entertaining and an important work of adult animation.</p>
