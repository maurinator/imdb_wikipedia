<h1>The Wind in the Willows (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When three tight friends Mole, Ratty, and Badger, find out that the infamous Mr. Toad of Toad Hall has been up to no good, they must find him and change his ways for good.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having now watched various versions of WITW with my 3 year old son, this was undoubtedly the best of the bunch for both of us, as well as being the most faithful adaptation, and captures the very special and very English magic of the book.Right from the start a warm elegiac mood and feel is achieved, and the voices of the four leading characters are all excellently cast. We especially loved Alan Bennet, who for me made Mole come fully alive for the first time, and manages to very subtly inject real humour into his delivery. Messrs Gambon (Badger) and Mayall (Toad), were also perfect.A perfect way to spend a cosy Sunday afternoon curled up with young (or indeed not so young) family.</p>
