<h1>Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A princess from a small Himalayan country becomes possessed by the spirit of a Venusian (a Martian in the American version) and escapes a plane just as it explodes. As this happens a meteorite falls from the sky containing Ghidorah, the monster responsible for her planet's destruction. At the same time, Godzilla and Rodan emerge from hibernation and not only attack Japan, but each other as well. Mothra, along with its twin priestesses, attempt to convince Godzilla and Rodan to stop their fighting each other and to team up to fight the new monster. At the same time, the princess is being hunted by a group of assassins who want to kill her so that her enemies can take over her homeland.</p>
<p>After a meteorite unleashes a three-headed beast upon Tokyo, Mothra tries to unite with Godzilla and Rodan to battle the extraterrestrial threat.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this one. I especially liked Ifukube's score. This is definitely the best in its original Japanese form. A three headed horror named King Ghidorah from the stars arrives and begins a destruction spree. Ghidora looks definitely the best in this film, the scenes of him flying in and out of Tokyo and demolishing landmarks with his lightning breath look incredible. Mothra (larval) tries to ask Godzilla and Rodan (who are still evil) to help her fight Ghidorah. They refuse until they see King Ghidorah destroy a town and brutally attack poor Mothra and then they leap into action and the battle for Earth begins. This is a great creature feature film, it has everything a creature feature film should: the four most famous monsters, missing princesses, martians, killers, scientists. The effects by Eiji Tsuburaya are dazzling and the Godzilla and King Ghidorah suits look the best they've ever looked while unfortunately Mothra looks like a living poop and Rodan looks like a chicken. I recommend this to kids and adults alike!</p>
