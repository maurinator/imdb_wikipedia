<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Juror is a lurid little crime/courtroom thriller from the 90's that features Alec Baldwin in one of his then frequent asshole roles, Demi Moore in a solid lead and a startlingly young Joseph Gordon Levitt as her son. It's silly in places, sensationalistic in others, but manages to hold attention with its thrills most of the time, which are of the brash variety that only that decade could achieve. Moore plays a struggling artist who is selected as a juror in the trial of a high profile mafia Don (Tony Lo Bianco). No sooner than day one of the proceedings, she is harassed, terrorized and blackmailed by a nasty piece of work known as 'The Professor' (Baldwin), a boorish thug with delusions of eloquence, employed by the Don to see that the jury swings his way in the end. Baldwin tears into his role like a velociraptor, voraciously careening through the film like a bull in a china shop. Moore brings her introspective innocence, and Levitt is a bright eyed young chap in what is probably one of his first roles. James Gandolfini is a supporting standout as Baldwin's uneasy accomplice, and there's work from Michael Constantine, Matt Craven, Lindsay Crouse and Anne Heche as well. Won't knock your socks off, but a good time nonetheless, and worth a peek just to see Baldwin nearly give himself an aneurysm trying to out-crazy himself.</p>
