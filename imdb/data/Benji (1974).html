<h1>Benji (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The first movie about the famous golden mutt. Benji is a stray who has nonetheless worked his way into the hearts of a number of the townspeople, who give him food and attention whenever he stops by. His particular favorites are a pair of children who feed and play with him against the wishes of their parents. When the children are kidnapped, however, the parents and the police are at a loss to find them. Only Benji can track them down, but will he be in time? If he can save the day, he may just find the permanent home he's been longing for.</p>
<p>A stray dog saves two kidnapped children.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie for the first time when I was about six years old. I loved it the first time I saw it and I still love it today. My three kids received it for Christmas and they love it as well (they're 7, 4 and 3). It's a movie about two kids, brother and sister, who feed and play with Benji. His origins are unknown and he has no permanent home. He has several friends whom he visits daily and as such has a routine with which he see's them. Bill, the man who owns the café, pays Benji with a dog bone everyday he comes by because when he comes by that let's Bill know that it's time to get the café ready for the lunch rush. The kids want to keep Benji (and his new found girlfriend, Tiffany) but their father won't hear of it. Then the kids get kidnapped and it's up to Benji to help save them. I won't say anymore as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it.</p>
