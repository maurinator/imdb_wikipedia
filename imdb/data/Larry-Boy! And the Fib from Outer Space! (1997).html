<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Veggietales Covers many topics, this one about telling the truth. and it also produces one of Veggietale's most loved characters...The one and only, Larry-boy! Larryboy patrols the streets of Bumblyburg everyday, usually not finding much to do, until one day, something from space lands in bumblyburg. larryboy has to find it and neutralize it, but unfortunately, it's hiding in young junior asparagus's home. and while junior and laura carrot are having a tea party, junior is short of one plate for Mr. snuggly, his teddy bear. so he climbs up the bookcase to grab a collectable plate hit dad owns...the plate is "arfogottie" (i think thats how it's spelled" and boasts "the greatest bowler to ever roll the ball, only 200 plates made, it's collectable." and while he tries to grab it, it falls off the top of the bookcase and smashes on the floor. laura immediately runs home, and junior is stuck alone. then the alien, called fib, emerges. he convinces junior to lie about the plate, claiming "oh, a little fib doesn't hurt anyone." of course thats a lie, because junior's little fib grows...literally and figuratively.yes, the topic of lying. anyone could learn a lesson from this, not just Christian's. never lie, because that little fib's gonna grow, eventually, you'll have to lie again when someone else gets mad at your lie. add the 2 fibs. they grow. then, it gets so big, only the truth can get you out of it.9 out of ten.</p>
