<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Seriously,I mean, who really gets  tired of seeing Michael Keaton playing a housewife?  There's just no equivalent to this when it comes to great comedy. I've seen it countless times, and can't believe how little recognition this film actually gets.   The main plot of the movie is that Keaton gets fired (or laid off, I can't honestly remember, it's been so long since I've seen it...) from his job, and ironically enough his wife wants to go to work for an advertising company.  Reluctantly he agrees, and what follows is just pure chaos.  He loves his wife, but at times you get the feeling not enough to keep doing the daily, mundane rituals, he feels woman should be stuck with doing.It's a great comedy and an awesome rent for anyone over the age of 10. A film that you could actually watch with your kids, and still not have them get certain underlying jokes.A 9 out of 10 in my estimation.  10 being the highest that is, and the reason I give it a 9 and not quite a 10, well....I guess you'll just have to watch it to make your own decision about that.And that's my review.</p>
