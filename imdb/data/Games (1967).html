<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Crafty little thriller about a wealthy, bored young couple (James Caan and Katharine Ross) who resort to playing kinky games for kicks.  The games turn deadly though when mysterious stranger Simone Signoret insinuates herself into their lives.  After a rather slow start,  Games soon segues into an exciting, serpentine mystery that seems way ahead of its time for 1967. Although modern audiences have become too adept at sniffing out clues and predicting twist-endings,  this film is still very effective at keeping its audience guessing.  Rarely shown on tv,  but if you do have the opportunity to see it...do!</p>
