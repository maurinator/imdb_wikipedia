<h1>The School of Flesh (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fashion executive Dominique's obsession for Quentin, a young bisexual hustler, fills her desire for physical love but leaves her taxed emotionally. Twists and turns in the relationship, along with the man's violent and abusive nature, force Dominique to reconcile the conflicts created by her passion. In this quest, Dominique is aided [and sometimes hindered] by friends, clients, and Quentin's former and current acquaintances.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Beno√Æt Jacquot (Right Now) has taken a script by Jacques Fieschi, based on a Japanese novel by Yukio Mishima, added superstar Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher) and Vincent Martinez, in his first acting role to give us an interesting and satisfying look at the older woman/younger man romance.While having a younger man was satisfying for Dominique (Huppert), the effort to keep him was physically and emotionally exhausting. It did not help that Quentin (Martinez) earned a living being available to men as well.Huppert is a guarantee for a good show, and she can act, too - a satisfying combination.</p>
