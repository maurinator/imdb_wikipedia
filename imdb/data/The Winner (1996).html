<h1>The Winner (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A story about a man who can't seem to do anything but win at the tables in Vegas. This, of course, brings hustlers out of the woodwork intent on using him for financial gain. One of them is the man's brother who, incidentally, is trying to find who it was that killed their father, while still another is a woman who has schemes of her own. Couple all of this with drug kingpins and general thugs and you have a comedy with a fresh twist on surviving in Vegas.</p>
<p>When it is discovered that a man is having luck in the casinos in Las Vegas, people start attempting to take his money.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rebecca De Mornay - yes! Vincent D'Onofrio - yes! Delroy Lindo - yes! Michael Madsen - yes! What more could you want in a movie.Put them in Vegas and give us a story about robbery, and you got me. yes, you got me - with a movie that just didn't seem to go anywhere. It just jumped all over the place and had no consistent theme.Wendy Riss is just not a scriptwriter, yet. Work some more and get it right.I expected much more from director Alex Cox, especially after the job he did with Rosario Tijeras. I was so disappointed.Not a winner!</p>
