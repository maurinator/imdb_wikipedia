<h1>Hero's Island (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1718 a recently freed family of indentured workers inherits the small uninhabited Bull Island off the Carolina coast. The family consist of husband and wife, one son, and a second son who they bought as a baby. The local fishermen who were already using the island think they own the island and attempt to force the family to leave, during which the husband is killed. The conflict over the island escalates as more people including a castaway, a fugitive from justice, and hired heavies join each side. Not everyone is who they seem to be or claim to be.</p>
<p>Bonnett was a real buccaneer in the early 18th Century, known as "The Gentleman Pirate" both for his taste in fine clothes and his reputed kindness to the women that he robbed. Here Bonnett is less refined, but he's still coming to the aid of a besieged widow and her family while marooned on an island by his mutinous crew.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Offbeat work which pits a pious family against a bench of violent weirdoes on an Island .The main problem for the virtuous ones is that they shall not kill or hurt anyone.In 1956,the Quakers in William Wyler's wonderful classic "Friendly persuasion " had the same problems.The best part is the first one,with the family's arrival,the father's death and the omnipresence of biblical references.But as soon as James Mason 's character shows himself a fierce pirate,but a big-hearted one,the plot peters out,and it's nothing but routine action movie.The mother is akin to Grace Kelly's character in Fred Zinneman's "high moon"(1952),and like her,she will have to do what she 's very loath to.The main characters have backgrounds that could have provided many other movies with a subject.All this does not hang  together well and ,all in all, it remains a poor man's "friendly persuasion"</p>
