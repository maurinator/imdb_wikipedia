<h1>True Grit (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Battle fatigue can be totally enervating. McKay verbally abuses a soldier in the field who could not let go of a tree and get into the helicopter; they manage to get him into the chopper and back to base where Dr. Seymour deals with him. The policy is to get men without casualties back in to the field as soon as possible, but Anderson requests that Dr. Seymour find a way not to send Martsen back to the field. The major in the psych ward orders Martsen back to active duty, and he is shot in the next skirmish. Ruiz finally goes to see Dr. Seymour about his view that he is a coward because he is afraid to go into battle. A Vietnamese girl tells Johnson he is the father of her baby, and though the truth of the claim is questionable, Johnson wants to help her.</p>
