<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a stinker. This movie was a total bore. I wanted to like this film because I'm a fan of all of the major characters. However, the characters were totally unbelievable. The Southern accents were laughable. There was no chemistry between any of the actors, let alone the two main stars. The acting was stiff and wooden, and appeared forced. In other words, it looked like they were acting. Poor Ally had a sour looking face the entire film. She must of realized what a stinker this movie was. I'd rate this movie no better then a local high school drama play. If you want to see a movie about racial injustice, rent the DVD classic, To Kill A Mockingbird; don't waste $14.99 buying this mess.</p>
