<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All fans of Robert Mitchem,(Dr. Jeff Cameron)"Cape Fear" '62, must see this great classic film, with Claude Rains (Frederic Lannington) "The Invisible Man"'33, who fight over a mixed up gal, Faith Domerque (Margo Lannington),"It Came from Beneath the Sea",'55.  Dr. Jeff unfortunately falls in love with the wrong gal and goes through hell trying to cope with murder and is forced into a marriage without a divorce.  Even Maureen O'Sullivan, wife of Tarzan,(Jane) who is Julie Dawn in this picture gives an excellent performance.   It is a must see picture with great acting by Mitchem and Rains !</p>
