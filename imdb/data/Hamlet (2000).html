<h1>Hamlet (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>New York, 2000. A specter in the guise of the newly-dead CEO of Denmark Corporation appears to Hamlet, tells of murder most foul, demands revenge, and identifies the killer as Claudius, the new head of Denmark, Hamlet's uncle and now step-father. Hamlet must determine if the ghost is truly his father, and if Claudius did the deed. To buy time, Hamlet feigns madness; to catch his uncle's conscience, he invites him to watch a film he's made that shows a tale of murder. Finally convinced of Claudius's guilt, Hamlet must avenge his father. Claudius now knows Hamlet is a threat and even uses Ophelia, Hamlet's love, in his own plots against the young man. Murder will out?</p>
<p>Modern-day New York City adaptation of Shakespeare's immortal story about Hamlet's plight to avenge his father's murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hamlet is a truly exciting movie.  I took and nine year old and seven year old to see it, and afterwards they retold me the basic story and COMPLETELY understood it.  Mad props to director Almereyda for having such strong visuals that also told the story. It is a great introduction to Shakespeare for young people who just can't dig the old "British" f***s in tights doing Shakespeare. The acting was terrific.  I hope old stodgey Shakespeare fans will open their minds to these refreshing and innovative takes on the characters, such as how Bill Murray did Polonius. I totally agree with Elvis Mitchell of N.Y.Times in his review of Bill Murray. Ethan Hawke was perfect as Hamlet.  Julia Stiles was really engaging, especially her flip-out scene at Guggenheim.  Sam Shepard and Dianne Venora were brilliant. A must see.</p>
