<h1>The Comic (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A fictionalized account of the rise and fall of a silent film comic, Billy Bright. The movie begins with his funeral, as he speaks from beyond the grave in a bitter tone about his fate, and takes us through his fame, as he ruins it with womanizing and drink, and his fall, as a lonely, bitter old man unable to reconcile his life's disappointments. The movie is based loosely on the life of Buster Keaton.</p>
<p>Story of a brilliant silent-film comic whose talent is overshadowed by his ego.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brilliantly realized tragicomedy in a Citizen Kane framework,  obviously based on Buster Keaton.  A tour de force for Dick Van Dyke, whose film work was inconsistent at best.  But he nails Billy Bright from word one, and Carl Reiner's concise script gives him room to run.  Reiner's no slouch, either; check the restaurant meeting for some biting wit on the Let's Do Lunch mentality.  A boxoffice flop in '69-'70, tossed away on the lower half of double bills, or sent directly to subrun houses, this is a semi-classic that should be seen by all who love, or study, films.</p>
