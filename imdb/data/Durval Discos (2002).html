<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Durval Discos directed by Anna Muylaert is a film for those viewers who let a film to progress at its own rhythm. Although it is about a young girl,it cannot be termed as a children's film although it can be shown to young children, teenagers and youngsters.It is certainly not at all meant for non serious viewers more interested in Michael Schumacher kind of start. If ordinary viewers remain patient they will be suitably rewarded as there are numerous twists and turns related to this film's plot. One more good thing about this film is that it will surely dispel the notion that most of the films made in Brazil are violent films. Those who have seen "Alice in the cities" by Wim Wenders will be quick to recognize the common similarities related to both the films.This film is little different from the German film as in it the suspense builds slowly to ultimately result in an amazing finale. Like Rudiger Vogler in Wender's film, Ary Franca too gives a memorable performance as Durval. With "Durval Discos", admirers of Vinyl or LP or 33 tours will surely get a taste of the nostalgia for the past.</p>
