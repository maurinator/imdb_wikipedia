<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Burt Reynolds at times can be a really annoying actor, often portraying an enormous ego, that gets in the way of true acting. I am happy to report that is not the case with"Malone", as a very low key Burt Reynolds is complimented nicely by an always low key Scott Wilson. There are some great character actors in this one also, including Kenneth McMillan, and Tracey Walter. Cliff Robertson is the strong arming overzealous, disillusioned, "patriot", putting the squeeze on a small Oregon town. Reynolds walks away from his C.I.A. operative position, and winds up the unsolicited defender of decent folks. "Malone" is a very good action film, and one of Burt's best. - MERK</p>
