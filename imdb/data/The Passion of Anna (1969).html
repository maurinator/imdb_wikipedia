Meanwhile, the island community is victimized by an unknown person committing acts of animal cruelty.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bergman is a name one hears so often, and it is so associated with slowness and close-ups that he's intimidating even before one gets to watch him.  I picked this movie off the shelf just as I could have picked any other of his movies, and since I haven't seen others, I wouldn't know how to compare this to the rest of his work.But I liked it, I really liked it.  I didn't find it as 'slow' as much as 'focused,' where even the twitch of an eyebrow or a glance to the left is an action.  This minuteness was truly amazing.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of Bresson's Journal of a Country Priest. Because of this minuteness, I also found it very cruel and raw.  I am particularly thinking of the scenes with the animals (not only the sheep, but the dog as well, and especially the bird).And I have to say something about the colors.  They were amazing, so warm and so different from the narration, which was in itself detached and indifferent (maybe 'disinterested' is a better word).  The light was amazing (like what seemed like an eternal sunset when Eva and Andreas have dinner).  If this were a painting I suppose it would be realist or naturalist work, but the way the interviews cut in make it hyper-realist.  Other reviewers have criticized this but I found it as adding depth to the characters, because it gave them a new, real, life.The English title is misleading though, because it forces the viewer to focus on Anna, whereas the original title doesn't do that.  I found myself waiting for things to happen to Anna until I found out that there was no reason for that to happen.  I am very happy to have seen this, and will definitely not shy away from watching more Bergman movies.</p>
