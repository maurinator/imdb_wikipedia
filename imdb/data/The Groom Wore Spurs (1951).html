<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am writing this only because there are no IMDb user comments at January 2008. * I got this and A Shriek In The Night 1933 because they are Ginger Rogers, no other reason. Shriek has several detailed comments from people who know that era and they tend to rate it as okay entertainment as well as a useful example of the final days of one particular low budget production company. Also, a glimpse of Ginger before her RKO roles with Fred. The only problem, for me, with Shriek is the sound quality. It gets in the way. * Groom as a bit more mature, and also with okay sound and vision. Still only 4x3 black and white, but it is still a carrier for Ginger. This IMDb page does have a need for some reasonably well informed user comments.</p>
