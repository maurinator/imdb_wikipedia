<h1>Hukkle (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Using almost no dialogue, the film follows a number of residents (both human and animal) of a small rural community in Hungary - an old man with hiccups, a shepherdess and her sheep, an old woman who may or may not be up to no good, some folk-singers at a wedding, etc. While most of the film is a series of vignettes, there is a sinister and often barely perceptible subplot involving murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie on this years International Film Festival of Rotterdam. The reason I really love this film is not so much the story which isn't very outstanding. It is the way the story is being told. Almost no talking, just fabulous images and sounds. If you like any work of Bert Haanstra you will surely love this film.If you have any chance to attend a screening: go go go!!</p>
