<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have spoilers here.This game will stun you with its great action and graphics, but don't let that fool you.  The frustration level with this game nearly kills everything everyone at Rare worked so hard at to make.Remember the Gold Skulltullas from The Legend of Zelda:  Ocarina of Time? At least it wasn't necessary to get those.  Finding all the Tribals on Jet Force Gemini is absolutely essential in defeating the game's final bad guy, Mizar.  It will take a very long time to find those guys.Also, there are some huge contradictions.  The Tribal, Jeff, says that Mizar is headed for Earth in the end and that you need to use their super-fast spacecraft because yours isn't fast enough.  In order to use the spacecraft, you must recover all the missing parts and rescue all the Tribals that are hidden among various worlds.Think about it.  Mizar is speeding toward Earth and it will take longer to jump in your ship and chase him than it will to search out missing parts and mindless Tribals so you can use a ship that hasn't flown for centuries? Let's get real here!  Somebody at Rare wasn't thinking!Play this game if you like action, frustration, and have a lot of patience.</p>
