<h1>Laurel Canyon (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Newly graduated psychiatrist Sam and his fiancee Alex move to Los Angeles for Sam's residency and into Sam's mother's house in upscale Laurel Canyon. Only problem is, Sam's mother is still there, supposedly finishing up a record that she's producing for the band of her new boy toy, Ian. She seems more interested in smoking pot and drinking than actually working though. Alex doesn't mind but Sam is quite upset. Alex starts off focused on her work (finishing a dissertation on genomics), but is soon distracted by the rock-'n-roll lifestyle going on around her. Meanwhile, Sam is equally distracted by beautiful Israeli intern Sara.</p>
<p>When an uptight young man and his fiancee move into his libertine mother's house, the resulting clash of life attitudes shakes everyone up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was one of those movies that I think because of the premise, gets great reviews in alternative weekly presses, but strip away the shock value of the story and you get a movie filled with characters that you really don't care about. So many people are lauding Frances McDermott's performance, well just because the dinner is made with good ingredients doesn't mean the meal will be superb. Her character was just "oh so cool" and if she really cared for her son so much I think she might have actually thought about what she was doing, instead she hurts him in so many ways. This and the Beckinsale character's actions would be forgivable if Bale's character was really deserving of all this, but I just felt sorry for him for having to be surrounded by these people. Lastly, can anyone say they actually like the rock star in this movie? With him, Frances and all the rest of the lot living there I was just hoping to see a nice mud slide come and take out that damn house.</p>
