<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a movie best suited for the wee ones, and most adults will nod off, fast. I know. I did. Luckily, sort of, my daughters wanted to see it, again. And I made a serious attempt to remain awake.The animation will not give the Disney folks a reason to worry, as the cartoon elements look very early 70's Saturday morning cartoon style. The computer animation is decent, and it's a shame that the movie didn't go either way, as the two styles seem to look mismatched, or like two different groups were doing the movie and it was tossed together.My suggestion to those of you who want to get it for the kids, look for it at the local library, or use your "rent one, and get one free" coupon and rent something for YOU, and make the free movie "Faeries".The "Under Eight Set" will like it, but be sure you are in a comfy chair, or have a good book handy if you are in the same room this is being watched in.</p>
