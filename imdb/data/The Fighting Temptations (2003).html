<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hmm..an MTV production-doesn't suprise me a bit.  However, I'll have to agree with the majority of the people out here-the music is what made the film.  With top legendary gospel singers like Shirley Ceasar and Levert Sr., no wonder that choir was pumping!Beyonce's reindiction of "Fever" was very nice, although, I think they downplayed her look a little too much in the movie-they didn't want the famous "pop star" to leak out.  Her acting was mediocre, given that she didn't have much to work with being that the plot was so limited.The soundtrack is awesome, that's all I can say.</p>
