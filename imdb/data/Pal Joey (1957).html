<h1>Pal Joey (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joey Evans is charming, handsome, funny, talented, and a first class, A-number-one heel. When Joey meets the former chorus girl ("She used to be 'Vera...with the Vanishing Veils'") and now rich widow Vera Simpson, the two lecherous souls seem made for each other. That is, until Linda English comes along. Linda is a "mouse on the chorus line" and built like there's no tomorrow. But she's the typical good little girl from a good little home -- just the right ingredient to louse up Joey's cushy set up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on the naughty Broadway hit and featuring luscious tunes by Rodgers and Hart, Pal Joey was softened from his arrogant heel stage persona for this more sanitized film version. Now-good guy Joey (Sinatra) wants to open a swanky nightclub in San Francisco, enlisting the help of high society dame Vera Simpson (Hayworth), a former chorus girl. But things get sticky when Joey finds his eyes drifting towards the knockout Linda English (Novak). A leggy singer/dancer with aspirations of being a star, Linda also has a soft place in her heart for Joey. Of course, complications abound, along with much singing and dancing, before tying up nicely with a bouncy, breezy, "walking into the sunset" Hollywood finish.A couple of assets make Pal Joey unbeatable entertainment. The first are the wonderful Rodgers and Hart standards, mostly performed by Sinatra. Sinatra is at his all-time best. This was Hayworth's last big movie musical and she does not disappoint. Although actually younger than Sinatra, she was playing a role originally meant for Marlene Dietrich.  Hayworth is both gorgeous and haunting.  A must see for all Hayworth fans!</p>
