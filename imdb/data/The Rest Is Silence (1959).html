<h1>The Rest Is Silence (1959)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>English speaking Kruger, back from the U.S. to claim the Claudius Steel Works, his dead father made him sole heir to, drives through the back projected post war industrial German landscape to the house where mum has married uncle Van Eyk. Hardy is more willing to take the hand of the Ophelia character's ex-Nazi brother than uncle Peter Van or embrace the mother he hasn't seen for 20yr. With his U.S. official mate, Hardy watches the wide screen Nazi era coverage and offs 70 year old Forster. His daughter, who compares the death of a cut flower to murder, goes bonkers, while Peter Van recruits her brother but all the plotting is to no avail.The sterile industrial world, where German industry collaborates with the US on the then new H Bomb, never delivers the significance they want it to have. The psychiatry theme is marginally better. "'Gluck' is not a medical term."Ka√ºtner, the leading German, if not European, film maker of the forties and fifties, back from Hollywood, is on top of his game with every gesture, edit, element of the decor and choice of angle having purpose. Trouble is his "Hamlet" plot never recovers from the feebleness of Forster's death, with the rapid wind up total anti-climax.</p>
