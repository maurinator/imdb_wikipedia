<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The picture concerns upon Chinese communists (leader is Martin Benson) trying to destroy United States via some continued series of underground tunnels , made all the way from China under the Pacific Ocean , but some scientists , military (Kerwin Mathews , Al Mulok , Ed Bishop) and a gorgeous geologist (Vivienne Ventura) discover the scheme . It's a pulp movie of science-fiction genre in which there are action , suspense , intrigue , tension and is quite bemusing . The history deals with nasty Chinese people and American patriots who fight strongly to vanquish them.In spite of lack luster and budget is quite agreeable and funny . The plot is almost ridiculous and senseless but it's developed in fast moving and numerous surprises and for that reason is amusing . The movie has a precedent in those films of the 30s with Fumanchu (by Sax Rohmer) and Boris Karloff as heinous starring and nearest the series of the 60s (produced by Harry Alan Towers with Christopher Lee as the Chinese baddie) in which the ¨yellow danger¨ was a fearful enemy. The motion picture takes part of a genre which in the 80s attained splendor , thus : ¨Red Dawn¨ (by John Milius with Patrick Swayze) , ¨Invasion USA ¨(by Joseph Zito with Chuck Norris) and ¨Amerika¨ (by Donald Wyre with Kris Kristofferson) where the communists -Russkies generally- execute invasion on America . Rating : Average but entertaining.</p>
