<h1>Ski Party (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a college ski weekend, Todd and Craig pretend to be Jane and Nora, a pair of English girls. Their reasons? To meet girls, and to learn to ski. Along the way, Lesley Gore shows up on the bus to sing "Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows", and James Brown and the Fabulous Flames appear at the lodge to sing "I Feel Good".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Annette Funicello has a brief cameo as a professor, and Dwayne Hickman was added to the beach gang in a futile attempt to keep the series fresh. Really lame take off of "Some Like It Hot".  Aron Kincaid plays his usual big-man-on-campus pretty blond boy routine.  There are only two reasons to watch this movie.  Leslie Gore singing on the bus on the way to the ski resort, and James Brown doing a split in the snow the end of "I Feel Good".</p>
