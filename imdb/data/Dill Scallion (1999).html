<h1>Dill Scallion (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The rise and fall of a school bus driver turned country music singer. Roger Ebert calls this film festival favorite "A country music Spinal Tap." Written and directed by Jordan Brady</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This very funny parody follows the rise of the fictional Dill Scallion's country music career, including the genesis of his trademark wild on-stage dance, his first music video, and his big breakthrough at the Gingivitis Aid concert ("We must stop the madness of gum disease!" rails one character). The characters are all intentionally painted with very broad strokes, and the tongue in cheek humor keeps the movie going along at a great pace. Cameos by some country music superstars are also great fun...and even the movie's name is neat--Dill Scallion?  Yeah, the guy in question is about as smart as a vegetable...and that's a big part of the fun.</p>
