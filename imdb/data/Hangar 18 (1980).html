<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shortly after the launch of a satellite from a space shuttle the satellite collides with an UFO in front of the crew's eyes. Because of an election campaign some politicians try to hide the crashed UFO -- inside hangar 18.</p>
<p>During a Space Shuttle mission a satellite is rammed by an unidentified flying object. The UFO afterwards performs an emergency landing in the deserts of Arizona. However the White House denies it's existence because of the near presidential elections. The UFO is brought to the secret hangar 18 and the accident is claimed to incompetence of the astronauts Bancroff and Price. But the two fight against this and try to hunt down the UFO.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Consider some of the flying saucer films we have seen over the years. The occupants speak perfect English, often with American accents to boot.In this film we never get to see the aliens; they have a kind of Satanic presence. Instead we have a control panel that displays photographs of military and civilian installations, weird hieroglyphics, and a synthesised voice that speaks an unknown language. Now that is much better than a couple of humanoids with detectable Boston accents who carry away chloroformed females to father the next generation when they get them home.Robert Vaughn sheds his affable Man from UNCLE image and makes a vicious government agent.This is the only UFO film that I have ever taken seriously.</p>
