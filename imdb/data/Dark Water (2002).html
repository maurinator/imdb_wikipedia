<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After his acclaimed Ringu Hideo Nakata has made a brilliant, chilling horror film that won't soon be forgotten by any one who sees it.  Few films have the nerve to incorporate solid emotion into a good horror story. But this film is not afraid and it suceeds.  Because of the way it is you become so completely involved with the charachters and the storyline equally enhancing the scares ten fold. this film and everyone assoicated with should be commended for making one of the most terrifying horror movies of all time.  It's about a woman and her young daughter whom move into a new apartment.  It just so happens that the past occupant a little girl is haunting it.  And she must unravel the mystery as it approaches unrelentlessly.  Rush out and find this movie where ever you can. You won't regret it. Dark Water is an instant classic. prepare for some scare!!!!!!!!!</p>
