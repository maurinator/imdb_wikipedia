<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Famed Western with a magnificent John Payne and a splendid Lizabeth Scott .This exciting picture tells the story of Dan Ballard( John Payne, Allan Dwan's usual actor)a respected citizen of a little town called Silver Lode , on his wedding day he has just promised marriage a young fiancée(Lizabeth Scott)and settle down for a peaceful existence.Just when they are about to marry on July 4 ,comes a vengeful agent named McCarty (Dan Duryea) and his henchmen(Harry Carey Jr, Stuart Whitman, Alan Hale Jr). McCarthy has sworn revenge and detain to undercover gunfighter. But Ballard escapes and is only helped by a gorgeous saloon girl named Dolly(Dolores Moran).This classic western is plenty of suspense as the dreaded final showdown approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone against impossible odds as his fellow town people for help ,nobody is willing to help him but they pursue him , while he attempts to clear his name as wrongfully accused of murder . The narration is almost adjusted in real time,from the beginning,the wedding, until the ending confrontation and is approximately developed in eighty one minutes and the starring is given two hours to resolve the accusation as murderer. For that reason it results to be a ¨High Noon¨ (1954,Fred Zinnemann)variation along with a relentless allegory and criticism of HUAC black list and McCarthyst era. Ample support cast full of known secondary actors as Emile Meyer, Robert Warwick, John Dierkes, Harry Carey Jr, Stuart Whitman, Alan Hale, many of them usual in Western. Although made in low budget by the producer Benedict Bogeaus is a very efficient film and very entertaining.The picture contains an excellent cinematography by John Alton( Noir cinema's usual photographer) and appropriate musical score. This quickie is finely directed by Allan Dwan , a craftsman working from the silent cinema, but ¨Silver Lode¨ is his unqualified masterpiece. Dwan directed over 1400 films, including one-reels, between his arrival in the industry (circa 1909) and his final film in 1961. Among them some good Western as ¨ Restless breed, The rivers edge,Cattle Queen of Montana,and Montana Belle¨.</p>
