<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Perfect Female" is a decent episode of "The Andy Griffith Show" but for some reason it doesn't seem to be shown that often on TV...or perhaps I just seem to be missing it when it airs. Regardless, it's not one of the better episodes but is still quite solid.Thelma Lou's cousin is coming to town and she and Barney want to set her up with Andy. While Barney and Thelma Lou connive on how to get them together, Andy is amazingly willing to meet her. And, Andy and Karen hit it off well. However, Andy doesn't know she's a champion shooter and never bothers to ask her if she can shoot--and proceeds to try to impress her with his skeet shooting prowess. She's amused by this and doesn't tell him that she's a crack shot. Later, after Barney opens his big mouth, Karen is determined to show up Andy at the upcoming shooting competition.While this is an enjoyable episode, it isn't a particularly funny or heartwarming one. Decent but not especially memorable.</p>
