<h1>Youngblood (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A skilled young hockey prospect hoping to attract the attention of professional scouts is pressured to show that he can fight if challenged during his stay in a Canadian minor hockey town. His on-ice activities are complicated by his relationship with the coach's daughter.</p>
<p>New York farmer's son Dean Youngblood is a natural at ice hockey, the Canadian national sport. After selection for the Canadian Hamilton Mustangs, the future looks bright, even his landlady is hot. He falls in love with coach Murray Chadwick's daughter Jessie, causing a dangerous tension. Alas, his fine technique has one flaw: it's nearly without defense against brutality. That's the trademark of Racki, who wanted his team spot, and now takes it out on Dean and his team mentor Derek Sutton.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dean Youngblood (Rob Lowe) is a skilled teen hockey player in upstate New York. He gets a tryout for a junior league team in Hamilton. His father refuses but his older brother Kelly convinces him otherwise. Kelly had tried but got injured. Dean's speed beats out the brute Racki in the eyes of coach Chadwick. The team led by captain Derek Sutton (Patrick Swayze) hazes the rookie. The coach's daughter Jessie (Cynthia Gibb) is intrigued. His landlady Miss McGill (Fionnula Flanagan) has boarded and seduced many hockey players in the past.This is a pretty average coming-of-age movie. Rob Lowe is a charming young guy. Gibb is winsome. Swayze plays a good older mentor like he does in Dirty Dancing. Keanu Reeves gets a small role early in his career. It has a couple of memorable scenes like the hazing. It's not particularly outstanding but it does the job.</p>
