<h1>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film is a sequel in name only to Valley of the Dolls (1967). An all-girl rock band goes to Hollywood to make it big. There they find success, but luckily for us, they sink into a cesspool of decadence. This film has a sleeping woman performing on a gun which is in her mouth. It has women posing as men. It has lesbian sex scenes. It is also written by Roger Ebert, who had become friends with Russ Meyer after writing favorable reviews of several of his films.</p>
<p>A hip and happenin' all girl rock group head to LA to claim lead-singer Kelly's inheritance and make it (and make it) in LA. They immediately fall under the spell of rock'n'roll Svengali, the 'Teen Tycoon' of rock Ronnie 'Z-Man' Barzell, and other rapacious Hollywood party types as lustful porno actress Ashley St Ives, ravenous lesbian Roxanne and shady lawyer Porter Hall. Soon the girls fall into a morass of drugs and deceit as their recording success soars. It takes several tragedies to make them stop and think... but is it too late?</p>
<p>Three girls come to Hollywood to make it big, but find only sex, drugs and sleaze.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Easily the best (and funniest) film about sex, drugs and rock and roll, ever made!  Gorgeous women (Cynthia Myers is almost too incredible to believe), great tunes, time capsule worthy costumes, and break-neck editing, put this film in a class all its own.  There has truly never been anything like it. Must be seen (in WIDESCREEN ONLY) to be believed. Wonderfully appropriate score by Stu Phillips.  For what it is, the film's a masterwork. Recommended!</p>
