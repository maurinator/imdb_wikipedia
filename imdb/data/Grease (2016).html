<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was lucky enough to see this movie open at the Sarasota Film Festival this week and was blown away by genuine acting and storyline. Each scene had it's own significance that contributed to this well rounded production. The lead actress was sincere and incredibly endearing, the male lead was hilarious and so fun to watch. There were so many great characters everyone can relate to, from the cute young boys always getting into something, or the pre-teen girl who is transitioning from a "mama's girl" to a social teen. The everyday struggles of keeping the passion alive in a marriage through hard work, respect and dedication. Also, let's not forget the always amazing Burt Reynolds! Fantastic family film! Highly recommended!</p>
