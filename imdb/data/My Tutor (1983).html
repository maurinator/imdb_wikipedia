<h1>My Tutor (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>High school senior Bobby Chrystal fails his French class, which will block him from entering Yale. His rich, authoritarian father hires an attractive 29-year-old to tutor Bobby over the summer and help him pass a make-up exam. While Bobby's friends lead him away into strange excursions aimed at losing their virginities, Bobby finds all the extracurricular activities he needs with his new tutor.</p>
<p>Bobby has had trouble with French at school and so his rich parents hire a winsome 30-year-old tutor to help him with the first subject. The father is not exactly subtle about his interest in the tutor, but the woman prefers his much more sensitive son.</p>
<p>A rich father hires a tutor for his son. The son is a horny teenager and the tutor is a gorgeous blonde. Complications ensue.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My Tutor, a shameless exploration of arrested male teen-age sexual fantasy, is a forgettable film for everybody except the kids who were going through puberty when the film was released.  For those fortunate viewers, however, the film is a heady trip down memory (and mammary) lane.  Matt Lattanzi (Mr. Olivia Newton John) will astonish you with his wooden acting and breathy voice.  Crispin Glover will make you howl with his mannered delivery -- especially as he does a turn or two on the S/M wheel of a friendly neighborhood bordello.  Caren Kaye delights as the world-wise French tutor who fuels young Lattanzi's vivid imagination with her nocturnal skinny dips in the family pool.  Also notable: the jaw-dropping title pop tune warbled over the opening credits as limber vixens are put through the paces of an aerobic workout.</p>
