<h1>Phar Lap (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Phar Lap, the legendary Australian racing horse, is as well-known today for his mysterious death as for his fabulous accomplishments in life. Beginning at the end, the film flashes back to the day that Phar Lap, despite his lack of pedigree, is purchased on impulse by trainer Harry Telford. Phar Lap loses his first races, but Telford's faith in the animal is unshakable. Suddenly the horse becomes a winner, thanks to the love and diligence of stableboy Tommy Woodcock. American-promoter Dave Davis arranges for Phar Lap to be entered in several top races, where his "long shot" status results in heavy losses for the professional gamblers. Just after winning an important race in Mexico, Phar Lap collapses and dies; though the film never comes out and says as much, it is assumed that the horse was "murdered" by the gambling interests.</p>
<p>The true story of a Australian racehorse that becomes a champion with the help of a local stableboy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I used to groom and own standard breds, so I know the emotional attachment that can develop between horse and man. This movie got me so emotionally involved, I felt like I was there. The actors, the scenery, the music, the story, and the awesome appearance of the horse that played Pharlap gave me goosebumps. Especially exciting was when Pharlap was late and made his grand entrance onto the track at the 1930 Melbourne Cup. This movie is not only one of my favorites, but one of the most often watched by me.</p>
