<h1>The Baby Maker (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tish Gray had a baby and gave it up for adoption. She is contacted by a second childless couple who want her to have the husband's baby because of the wife's inability to have children. She accepts but finds that knowing the parents, and developing a relationship with them for the entire pregnancy complicates the simple arrangement.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An upper-class, childless couple in Southern California "hires" a comely hippie to bear the husband's baby (this being 1970, she conceives the old-fashioned way); soon, the straight-laced twosome are drawn into the young woman's world. Interesting, insightful, provocative (for its time), the movie does follow a typical by-the-numbers pattern (with an "open minded" boyfriend, jealousies and friction on all sides), but writer-director James Bridges is very tasteful and unhurried. He also gets some lovely shots of Barbara Hershey at her chestnut-haired, go-go-booted best (my favorites were her run across the street at the beginning, a stunning glimpse of her through a rain-soaked car window, and under the sheets in bed). The incredible finale refuses to compromise, and even though the medical aspects of the story are dated, the emotions are still on-target. *** from ****</p>
