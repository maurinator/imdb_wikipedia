<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Bond series was moving into the wrong direction in 1979 with Moonraker, John Glen takes over the directing for the next 5 adventures, beginning with 'For Your Eyes Only'.Bond is back down to Earth with a bang, a very satisfying entry in the Bond series. The film is much more Fleming-like, that is until Dalton comes in.The story is very interesting because it's more of a spy movie, Moore has some work to do here!!! There's no reliance on the gadgets. The Bond girl played by Carole Bouquet is very good, not just a pretty girl!The acting is much better than Moonraker, John Glen eases into the directing quite comfortably.The photography is wonderful, very realistic colour use.There are some fun stunt sequences, the ski chase is fantastic.The film score is fun, but a product of its time, unlike Barry, the music doesn't transcend the generations!Overall, 'For Your Eyes Only' is a satisfying Bond picture. Obviously you'll be viewing it in wide-screen!!! James Bond returns in Octopussy!</p>
