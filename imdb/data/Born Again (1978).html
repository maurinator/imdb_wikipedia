<h1>Born Again (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Charles Colson was involved in the infamous Watergate scandal that brought down the administration of former President Richard Nixon. Colson was sentenced to prison for the crimes he committed in the name of "national security", and while in prison he underwent a religious conversion. This film tells the story of his life up to, including and after his conversion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here we are 30 years after Watergate, and Chuck Colson has become a leading advocate for prison reform, civil rights, and other benevolence issues. By his own admission, Chuck was a "win at all costs" hatchet man for Nixon. While serving a prison sentence for his role in the scandal, Colson found the ultimate forgiveness by giving his life to Jesus Christ. After all this time, I strongly disagree with the previous comment casting doubt on Colson's life change. What more can the man do to demonstrate that his about face in life is real? The movie was extremely popular in its day, and accurately tells the story of his conversion to Christianity. In a day when everyone is calling for character and integrity in the public arena, Chuck Colson's story is a refreshingly happy ending to a very bad beginning.</p>
