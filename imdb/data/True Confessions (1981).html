<h1>True Confessions (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>De Niro (a Catholic Priest) and Duvall (a Homicide Detective) play brothers drawn together after many years apart, in the aftermath of the brutal murder of a young prostitute.</p>
<p>In 1948 Monsignor Desmond Spellacet, a judicious, ambitious monsignor working at the behest of the worldly Cardinal Danaher, is deeply involved in church-sponsored real estate development projects, all of which are very profitable for the local Catholic diocese. He has an edgy, uneasy relationship with his gritty, quick-tempered older brother, Detective Tom Spellacy of the LAPD, a one time bagman for corrupt builder Jack Amsterdam. Despite his murky past and iconoclastic temperament, the homicide detective has a strong sense of honor and resents the hypocrisy of Amsterdam and other members of the establishment. The brothers' paths cross when Tom covers up the death of a prominent Catholic priest in a local brothel run by madam Brenda Samuels, who has history with both the detective and Amesterdam. Tom's path again crosses his brother's when he investigates the gruesome homicide of a young prostitute whose body has been cut and half and thrown in a deserted lot. Circumstances cause both brothers to have crises of conscience as each tries to attain redemption and regain self-esteem.</p>
<p>A worldly ambitious monsignor clashes with his older brother, a cynical Los Angeles homicide detective who is investigating the brutal murder of a young prostitute.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently pulled out my old copy of True Confessions and watched it again. The thing that struck me the most was the incredible display of extraordinary acting by so many of the actors.  DeNiro and Duvall are simply mesmerizing. The supporting cast - Burgess Meredith, Cyril Cusack and Rose Gregorio - are as good as any supporting cast in any movie. The film has mood and texture, and evokes the Los Angeles of the late 1940's in brilliant detail.John Gregory Dunne has used the real life Black Dahlia murder of 1947 to weave a complex story of corruption in the Catholic Church and the LAPD. A very underrated film.</p>
