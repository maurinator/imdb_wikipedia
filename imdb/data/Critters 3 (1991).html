<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On a road-trip with her family, a teen and her brother encounter a strange creature that manages to follow them to their apartment- complex in the city and begin eating the residents forcing a former fighter to help stop the creatures.This one was quite the fun and highly enjoyable entries in the series. There's not much really wrong here with this one and most of that really stems from the fact that there's just a way too long beginning that holds off the creature's appearance until much later than expected here. The trip through the countryside and meeting up with the different residents of the complex aren't all that impressive or exciting efforts throughout here watching this, and it really does get this off to a somewhat sluggish beginning. Coupled with the again heavy cheesiness on display, these here are the film's few problems that do crop up here that makes for a few small problems but not nearly enough here to hold off the far more impressive and enjoyable amount of fun featured along the way here. Again, the film's inherent cheesiness and absolutely goofy creatures at the forefront of the film are a major part of the film's enjoyment as this one manages to get a lot of mileage out of them. The very nature of featuring them in the same exact set-up as before, with their hairy-reptilian appearance and miniature stature that practically devours everything in their path allows for some silly comedy to come from them breaking into the apartment and watching a cooking show on the television set or eating through the entire apartment simply because they're left alone inside, being able to contemplate strategy sessions and a plan of attack which manage to get some nice laughs with their cheesy natures all work together into making for some cheesy good times. The fact that there's some thrilling suspense moments as well gives this some even bigger pluses which manages to give this the same sort of feeling that occurred in the original where it gives this it's biggest plus, from the encounter in the laundry-room basement, the family's first encounter on the hallway leading to their battle to barricade the apartment from the creatures and the different encounters up in the attic where they finally manage to get away from the creatures gives this plenty of thrilling action scenes all built on the idea of the fun, goofy creatures still being perceived as a threat with their voracious appetite leading to the fun here. Along with the great manner of bringing them to life here, these here manage to make this one a fun and enjoyable addition to the franchise.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.</p>
