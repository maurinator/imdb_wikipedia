<h1>Because They're Young (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Neil Hendry is the new high school teacher in town, but he is still haunted by a tragic event in his past. However, his friendly, casual style wins the hearts of some of the school's more troubled teens, as well as the principal's secretary. He is able to positively help them both in and out of school. But these same attributes make him an enemy of the principal, who discourages such close relationships between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Neil Hendry is at a transitional period in his life. He has been made temporary guardian of his nephew, Eric, whose parents died in an automobile accident. Neil feels guilty because he was driving the car. The accident also resulted in Neil sustaining a leg injury which ended his promising college football career. He has left thoughts of football behind him. Neil has to display to the authorities that he is responsible enough to be awarded permanent custody of Eric. He has just been appointed to his first teaching post at Harrison High as the American History teacher. Principal Donlon hired Neil despite their differences in teaching outlook, with Principal Donlon taking a straightforward academic approach, and Neil taking a more humanistic approach. Neil feels that no student is irredeemable, if one really gets to know them as a person. Troubled student Griff Rimer, who is holding some information over good student Ann Gregor, may be a good test case. But some otherwise good students may also require a sympathetic teacher's ear to keep out of trouble.</p>
<p>New high school teacher tries to help troubled students and falls in love with the principal's secretary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At the time this movie came out, the generation emerging from the late Fifty's into the early Sixty's, didn't have any desires different than the previous generation. Since the turn of the 19th century parents became more and more lax or permissive you might say (for whatever reasons). The main difference, to me, was the way in which those teens behaved & expressed themselves. More and more, kids wanted to have fun but found that "Fun", doing different things. My formative years experienced dire warnings of "bad associations, trouble making rebels, leather jacket kids were no good, combing your hair with in a jelly roll style was for delinquents and so on." So I tended to be careful but respectful of others. "Because They're Young" was a successful attempt to capture the "atmosphere" the "Ambiance" of the era. Being Hollywood, over dramatization was and is not uncommon. Yet the sense of being "young" (after all these years) isn't a lost cause. It will always be very much alive and well. All it will ever really need is for older folks to empathize, sympathize and not forget that "Because They're Young" was them too, once upon a time.</p>
