<p>Psychics hired to find lost temple...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a light hearted film featuring a knock out comedy performance by Cindi Lauper.  Jeff Goldblum is charming, bemused and droll and Peter Falk is so funny.  They all wind up in South America seeking "a room of gold", and dancing a lovely tango.The scenery is beautiful, the music lush.I consider this movie a friend.</p>
