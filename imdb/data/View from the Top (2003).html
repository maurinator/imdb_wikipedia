<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie cant decide what it wants to be.It's not a Mike Myers comedy but spends an awful lot of time with Myers.It doesn't bother to develop any decent kind of romance for its main character but then takes too much time worrying about her romantic needs.It spends most of the script have the girls do stupid things and the rest has super glamorous Paltrow run around super glamorous hotels and European locations.I think this was meant to be a chic romantic comedy but the script revolted and tried for three stooges.If one likes Gwyneth its a must,she absolutely looks stunning here.Thats about the only reason to watch this.</p>
