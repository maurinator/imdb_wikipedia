<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this adaptation of Fran√ßoise Sagan's best selling novel, Paula is a beautiful and highly successful 40-year-old businesswoman. She is deeply in love with Roger, her mature consort of five years. Roger is a very charming gallant who loves Paula but is too selfish to give up his freedom to be promiscuous. When Paula meets Phillip, the 24-year-old immature lawyer son of one of her rich clients, he falls hopelessly in love with the glamorous, sympathetic older woman and insists that the age difference will be no barrier to a romance. Paula resists the young man's persistent advances, but she finally succumbs when Roger initiates yet another affair with one of his young Maisies. An affair begins, and society does not approve.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The most sobworthy romantic film I've ever seen. I would've cried, except my brother was present. Perkins was the only fun thing in it, with his "play-acting". In one part, he single-handedly did an impression of an entire U.S. law court, speeded up. I will take that sequence with me to the grave. And of course, the other brilliant bit when Perkins, COMPLETELY drunk, decides to join Bergman and Montand in the club. It ends up with him being driven home with his head knocking against the car window... But the end was the most distressing part - well, I won't spoil that for you. Not a classic, but I highly recommend it if you want a good old cry. A Maud rating of 4 out of 5.</p>
