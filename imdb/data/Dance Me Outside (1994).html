<h1>Dance Me Outside (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A story of life on a First Nation reserve in Ontario: Silas and Frank are trying to get into college to train to be mechanics but they find themselves having to deal with girls, family ... and murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my favourite films.  It is both realistic and uplifting and the characters are engaging and interesting.The film deals with serious issues and problems but the witty dialogue and humour is a breath of fresh air in a weighty world.I was glad to see "The Rez" as a pilot on CBC (same characters, most of the same actors), however it was short-lived and a bit of a disappointment.</p>
