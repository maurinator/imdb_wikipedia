<h1>King of the Grizzlies (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ernest T. Seton, an American artist and author, tells the story of a mighty grizzly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Yesno as Moki, Chris Wiggins (I) as The Colonel and Hugh Webster as Shorty in a pleasant enough family film, more of a grizzly life?s documentary with a sparse human element wrapped around it than an actual movie, about the life of a male grizzly from cub to adult. During his life as a cub, he loses his mother and is rescued from certain death by a Cree Indian, Moki, and released in the high mountains surrounding the ranch Moki works on for the Colonel. The story shows the viewer a gentle, laid back view of the life of a typical bear with beautiful high mountain scenery and a glimpse of the rugged life of those intrepid souls who went west with a dream and established the big cattle ranches that eventually lead to the settling of the wide open country once owned by the Indians and animals, who unlike these, lived together in harmony. Good for a time when you just want a quiet nature story and great mountain photography as not much in the way of excitement happens until near the end when the big bear?s future becomes very uncertain after he crosses the tough rancher. 2 our of 4 stars db</p>
