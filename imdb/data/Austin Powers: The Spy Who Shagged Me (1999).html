<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Evil uses a device he calls a "Time Machine" to travel back to 1969 and remove Austin Powers' mojo. The sexually wounded swinger must travel back in time and, with the help of agent Felicity Shagwell, recover his vitality. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's personal life runs amok as he discovers love, continues to shun his son and develops a close relationship with himself. Well, actually, a clone 1/8 his size whom he dubs "Mini-Me". The always time-baffled Dr. Evil begins his plan to put a gigantic cannon on the moon, thus turning it into a device called either "The Death Star" or "Alan Parson's Project," depending on which name is available.</p>

But for Austin it is about to get a lot worse when Dr. Evil travels back through time to the year 1969 and he steals Austin's Mojo (Austin's body-fluid that makes attractive to the opposite sex) leaving Austin shagless. Travelling back into 1969, Austin teams up with sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell as both Austin and Felicity must not only recover Austin's mojo, they must also stop Dr. Evil from wiping out Washington DC with a laser gun, Dr. Evil has constructed on the moon. Can Austin defeat Dr. Evil again?</p>
<p>Dr. Evil returns from space just as British spy Austin Powers learns on his honeymoon that his wife is a fembot in Evil's control. Back on the singles scene, Powers discovers he's impotent because Evil has used a time machine to return to the late 60s and steal his libido. British intelligence also has a time portal, so Powers goes back to 1969 to recapture his mojo and, teaming with agent Felicity Shagwell, to stop another Evil plot to take over the world, this time with a "laser" beamed from the moon. Subplots involve Evil's son Scott's discovery of who his mother is, Evil's affection for a clone one-eighth his size, and the machinations of an obese Scot named Fat Bastard.</p>
<p>Dr. Evil is back...and has invented a new time machine that allows him to go back to the 60's and steal Austin Powers's mojo, inadvertently leaving him "shagless".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me is a simply hilarious movie created by Mike Myers who also plays some of the movies major characters such as Austin Powers,Dr Evil and Fat Bastard (who sounds just like Mike Myers future voice role,Shrek).Its one of my all time favourite comedy films.it had me laughing all the way through and Ithink it is the best of the three films.It should definitely have a better rating on this.Austin Powers must travel back in time to stop his nemesis Dr Evil from taking his mojo while hes frozen in time.He meets a lady from the 60s who he falls for,meanwhile,Dr Evil is having his own trouble with his son Scott (Seth Green) who he doesn't love because hes not as evil as him,so he creates a smaller version of himself to love like a son,called Mini-Me.</p>
