<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>woman] who has seen this movie and [the hard part] remembers it.  I refer to it as the "least discussed movie in th IMDB." Anyway, I wouldn't remember it except that at the time, I thought it was the strangest pic I'd seen.  The plot was straight TV fare, but the characters seemed to all be in a different movie.  They seemed to only cooperate where it was necessary to move the plot along. When it showed up on TV years later, I watched it a few times to see if I'd remembered it's strangeness...  I did, and about that time I added the Peck/Basehart version of Moby Dick to the "strange" list. In Moby Dick, the characters seemed to move through the story as do the characters in Monsoon.  Of cours, they had the advantage that we all knew the Moby Dick story, so in trying for a "fresh" presentation, a lot of what the characters did they did without any motivation that I could figure out. So I watched Moby Dick a few times, but I just never "got it."</p>
