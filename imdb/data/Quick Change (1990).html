<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a man dressed as a clown enters a bank and tries to rob it, no one takes him seriously at start. But as this New Yorker pulls this daring robbery with the help of his friends, it looks like leaving the bank with all the stolen money is the easy part! All they have to do now is make it out of the city and to the airport. They have plenty of time, but its not that easy as they seem to get out of one problem only to fall into another. Will they make before the cops catch up with them?</p>
<p>Grimm, a burnt-out New Yorker, has devised an ingenious plan to escape the city he hates so much; dressed as a clown, he robs a Manhattan bank and cleverly escapes disguised as a hostage along with his accomplices, girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis. However, whilst robbing the bank was comparatively straight-forward and easy, the getaway quickly turns into a nightmare, as the relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight becomes a tangled ordeal of obstructions, including confused roadworkers, conmen, mobsters, bureaucratic bus-drivers and a cabbie who doesn't speak a word of English. And all the while Rotzinger, the equally world-weary but relentless Chief of Police, is doggedly on their tail.</p>
<p>Three thieves successfully rob a New York City bank, but making the escape from the city proves to be almost impossible.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bill Murray stars as a bank robber with a unique plan - he'll rob the bank dressed as a clown, but carry out the money taped to his body - and those of his two accomplices - "hostages" who have been released as a sign of good faith as certain potential getaway vehicles (2 helicopters, a motorcycle, a city bus, and a monster truck) are provided.  The plan works perfectly as the gang makes their escape from the bank in plain sight. Then things go wrong.The movie contrasts the perfect execution of a difficult task - robbing a bank,  and then getting out and past the police, with the terrible execution of a simple task - getting to the airport in time to catch a flight.  In both stages, Murray provides the kind of humor associated with him, taking nothing seriously even in the tightest of situations. Jason Robbards provides an excellent contrast, as a chief of police who refuses to be outwitted by a smart-mouthed bank robber in a clown suit, who escaped from right under his nose.</p>
