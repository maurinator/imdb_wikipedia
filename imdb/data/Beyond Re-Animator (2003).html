<h1>Beyond Re-Animator (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Everyone's favorite mad scientist Herbert West is currently in jail after having state's evidence turned against him by his former assistant, Dan Cain. While being led away, some re-agent falls from his pocket where it is picked up by a young man who was camping nearby. The young man finds Herbert down in his jail cell and learns for himself just what the re-agent is capable of.</p>
<p>A dozen years later we find West is an inmate at a forbidding old Prison. In spite of his incarceration, West has been continuing his Re-animation research, using rats and mice for subjects, and electrocuting them with a special jerry-rigged apparatus. West has now identified an electrical phenomenon # the NEE # which is discharged from the brain at the moment of death...and which may be the 'missing link' in his studies: if the NEE is re-injected into a Re-animated Corpse, it should restore the 'subject' to full 'reason'...</p>
<p>After thirteen years in a prison ruled by a very mean director, Dr. Herbert West is invited to be the assistant of newcomer Dr. Howard Phillips, a brilliant resident, in the penitentiary infirmary. After being introduced to each other, Dr. Phillips discloses that the last experiment of Dr. West killed his sister thirteen years ago, when he was a boy, and he became fascinated with the possibility of bringing dead people back to life. The journalist Laura Olney, covering a matter for her newspaper in the prison, has an affair with Dr. Phillips and they fall in love. However, the experience of Dr. West loses control and the place becomes a branch of Hell.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ever since I began watching the original "Re-Animator", I loved it. Soon it became one of my favorite films, and I watched "Bride of Re-Animator", which was a horrible sequel. With average expectations I rented "Beyond Re-Animator", and let me say I was blown away. It's been thirteen years since Herbert West's former assistant turned state's evidence against him, and sent the doctor to state prison. Now, an eager young doctor wants West as his assistant in the prison after seeing West's work during the final Miskatonic misexperiment. Soon, the doctor is the assistant and West is the doctor as he continues experimentation into re-animation of the dead: only this time, it's one step higher ... Jeffrey Combs is better than ever as the mad West, giving us a terrific performance. The rest of the cast is very good as well; Brian Yuzna's direction has improved, and the script is great; there's also a cool score by Xavier Cappellas. "Beyond Re-Animator" is one of my favorite films, and one of the best horror films of 2003. It features some quite funny comedy, mixed with great, gory horror in the tradition of the first film. It is completely entertaining and features some very nice story ideas. Think of it as "Shawshank Redemption" with re-animation and Dr. West - oh, forget it. I found that the film was almost as good as the first "Re-Animator", and way above the "Bride". It's great to have West back again. And the ending is terrific - fans of the first film can sit back and smile with satisfaction ...I would highly recommend "Beyond Re-Animator" to any horror fan, and it is essential for fans of the first film. Easily one of my favorite horror films. Be sure to stick around to see the hilarious end fight between a rat and the warden's severed ... thing.</p>
