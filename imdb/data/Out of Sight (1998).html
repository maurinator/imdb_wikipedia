<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I, too, had a little trouble buying that such an intense relationship was born from such a minor conversation between them in the trunk.  However, when I was able to get past that inconsistency in the plot, I found a great movie.  Clooney and Lopez have great chemistry and show that they are both actors worthy of recognition.  I loved the editing--the choppy cuts and the freezing of certain scenes.  And I have never seen a better seduction scene in my life.  The supporting cast was great too, especially the incomparably zany Steve Zahn.  And once I got past the improbability of the relationship being so intense that she would risk her career for it, I thought that the way that she did risk her career was just great.  I laughed out loud at the scene when he waves to her from the elevator.  That is just a wonderful illustration that not everything is clear-cut or easy to do.  Clooney was phenomenal, so cool...and just resigned to his life.  I loved it.By the way, seeing this movie after Jennifer Lopez has launched her career in pop music simply infuriated me that Hollywood has all but lost a true talent to the world of bubblegum pop.</p>
