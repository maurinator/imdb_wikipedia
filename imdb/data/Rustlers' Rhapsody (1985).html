<h1>Rustlers' Rhapsody (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While the audience watches a black and white horse opera, a narrator's voice wonders what such a movie would be like today. Rex O'Herlihan, The Singing Cowboy, finds himself in color and enters a cliché-ridden town, in which the evil cattle baron (Andy Griffith) and the new Italian cowboys (who always wear raincoats no matter how hot it gets) join forces to get him and the sheep ranchers to leave the valley.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Rustlers' Rhapsody" is a homage to Western movies, a sort of Luke Lucky, actually a satire to the Western movies. This film shows all the clichés usually presented in this genre in a funny and laconic way. There are the characters of the bar tender, the corrupt sheriff, the drunkard, the prostitute in the saloon, the powerful farmer, the 'bad guys' and the 'good guy'. The acting and the direction are very reasonable and Hugh Wilson is the director of the hilarious "Police Academy". In the end this movie is a forgettable and funny entertainment indicated for fans of Western flicks. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Vaqueiro Cantador" ("Singer Cowboy")</p>
