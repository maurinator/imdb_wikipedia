<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jackie Chan plays a cop who chases a criminal from Russia to Australia.I don't bother telling more about the plot because it's really not important in this kind of movie.This is like a James Bond movie.But there's Chan, Jackie Chan in this one.The fighting sequences are unbelievable in this movie and there is a lot of action in it.Jackie hangs from a helicopter, skis with one ski, uses ladder for fighting and then there's under water action in the movie.It is also very funny.Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu which is also known as Jackie Chan's First Strike from 1996 was Jackie's first movie for American people to see.Jackie Chan is unbelievable in his moves.He is like new Bruce Lee but with his own style of course.He does his own stunts like Buster Keaton did.It is nice to watch the bloopers during credits.If you like martial arts or Jackie Chan this is a movie for you to enjoy.</p>
