<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>TRANSYLVANIA 6-5000 (3+ outta 5 stars)I dunno what it is about this movie... I'd be the first to admit that the story is silly and the script is terrible... yet somehow this movie winds up winning me over every time I see it.  What saves the movie from tedium and even makes it *memorable* are some of the weird, crazy performances... primarily by a pre-Seinfeld Michael Richards whose loopy servant character is indescribable.  He improvised the whole thing... and most of the time it's not even clear WHAT he's trying to do or WHY he's funny... he just IS.  Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley make a good comedy team (seemingly influences by Abbott and Costello more than anything else).  Jeffrey Jones, Carol Kane, John Byner, Joseph Bologna and Genna Davis all have their moments as well. The story has two dim-bulb reporters (Goldblum and Begley) going to a small Transylvanian town to track down reports of monster, wolfman and vampire sightings.  You are either gonna love this movie or hate it.</p>
