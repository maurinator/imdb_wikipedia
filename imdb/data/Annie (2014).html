<h1>Annie (2014)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Annie is a young, happy foster kid who's also tough enough to make her way on the streets of New York in 2014. Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.</p>
<p>In this modern remake of the classic Broadway show ANNIE, the character "Annie" is portrayed as this beautiful little 10 - 12 year old girl hopelessly lost within the NYC foster care child program, yet smart, tough and bright enough to survive the fast-paced New York City streets. Forced to stay with her mean foster mom, Miss Hannigan, Annie somehow manages to tough-it-out in Harlem until one day she accidentally and literally runs into the wealthy billionaire and NYC Mayoral candidate, Will Stacks. Saving her from almost being hit by a car (while simultaneously being video taped by an unknown passerby) Stacks and his political team decide to use the life-saving incident to boost his polls for the upcoming NYC election. Taking Annie into his penthouse home, Stacks begins to fall "head-over-heels" for the adorable little Annie. Meanwhile Annie only has one hope and that is for her parents to someday come back and rescue her from the foster care program.</p>
<p>A foster kid, who lives with her mean foster mom, sees her life change when business tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Annie is a little orphan girl, who is looking for her parents every day. She lives in an orphanage with other girls. One day, when she is chasing a running dog, she is hardly run over by car. The person who helps Annie is Will Stacks, the mayor of New York City. He is evaluated by what he did. So as to get more votes, he and his secretary welcomes Annie to their palatial residence, and start living together. Annie knows that he is doing for the election, but for her, it is a good way to look for her parents too. How will the relationships be in the end? Can Annie find her parents? This movie is the remake version, and the previous one is shown a long time ago. Actually, I knew Annie, but I didn't have the opportunities to watch, so it was my first time. I was asked to watch this movie, and also I rent this DVD and watch a few times. I really like it. The story line is very good, and heartwarming. Also, since this is musical movie, about 10 songs are included. They make me very fun to watch, and didn't feel bored at all. I totally like everything.</p>
