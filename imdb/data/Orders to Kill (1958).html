<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film on the late show about 25 years ago & haven't seen it since but I still remember much of it vividly.  A soldier is parachuted into occupied France during World War II & is "ordered to kill" a resistance leader who is believed to have been collaborating with the Nazis.  However, as he works his way into the trust of his target, he begins to believe that he is a loyal Frenchman & not a Nazi sympathizer.  He expresses his doubts to his superiors, but they order him to continue his mission.  His decision & its consequences form the climax of the movie. Despite its obscurity, the film packs quite an emotional punch & I dearly wish I could see it again.  Perhaps time has burnished its image in my mind, but I would rate this as a superior war movie.</p>
