<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stuck somewhere in-between action, comedy, and drama, Wayans and Sandler seem awkward delivering more "seriously- based lines" instead of their usual off-beat quips. The action scenes are TERRIBLE, very unbelievable and EXTREMELY FAKE. There are also several minor actors who can't deliver a line worth a damn. Otherwise, the movie is VERY enjoyable, and includes several plot twists to keep things interesting. The duo, although a bit dry and out-of-place for this sort of thing do manage to pull things together and keep the movie memorable. Worth at least one renting.... :)</p>
