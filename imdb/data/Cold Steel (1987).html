<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Los Angeles police officer Johnny Modine's (The late Brad Davis, Midnight Express) father is brutally killed by ruthless cutthroat (Jonathan Banks, Pin) and his two goons, played by Adam Ant (Slam Dance) and Sy Richardson (Tripwire). As it turns out, the murder of Modine's father was part of a plan of revenge towards Modine for causing him to lose his voice and having to use an electronic talk box. On behalf of this, Modine is willing to risk his career and sanity to bring the killer down and avenge his father's death. Along the way, Modine is eventually taken off the case by his captain and meets the luring Kathy Connors (Sharon Stone, Total Recall), who hides a secret connection of her own to both the killer and Modine.I first saw the film on television when I was 14. I felt the exact way about the film then, and I sure as heck feel the same way about it now having watched it on DVD at the age of 21.Recommended.DVD EXTRAS: Widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film, English, French, Spanish, and Chinese subtitles and trailers for xXx, The Devil's Own and Enough.</p>
