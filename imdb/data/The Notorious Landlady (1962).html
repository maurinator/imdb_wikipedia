Since Carly is also American, Gridley saves his job by introducing her to the ambassador, who is promptly smitten and promises to help her. So when a Scotland Yard detective arrives, wanting to get to the truth one way or another, they say they'll help him. And then the comedic complications really begin.</p>

Unbeknown to him, Carly is under suspicion of having killed her husband. When his boss Franklyn Ambruster realizes what he's done, he contacts Scotland Yard and they press Bill to report on her activities.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kim Novak was a Columbia star and went from a supporting role in Jack Lemmon's great Phfft to co star in Bell Book and Candle to lead and top billed over Jack Lemmon in this wickedly funny comedy mystery directed by Richard Quine. This was the last movie Kim Novak made at Columbia and ended a legendary relationship between studio and star where Kim made Picnic, Pal Joey, Bell Book and Candle, Strangers When We Meet among others and her declared favorite film Middle Of The Night. Looking at times like the fabled Jean Harlow Ms. Novak reaches the top of the stardom ladder in this film. To me Kim Novak was what a movie star looked like!</p>
