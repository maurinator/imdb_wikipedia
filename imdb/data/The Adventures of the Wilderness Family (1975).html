<h1>The Adventures of the Wilderness Family (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>City dweller Skip leaves his urban life behind indefinitely to seek fresh air for his daughter's health. His wife begrudgingly sacrifices domestic comforts, while their darling boy Toby, their daughter Jenny, and their dog Crust have the time of their lives roaming in the wild. Meeting wildlife however has its pros and cons, especially as not all bears are nearly as tame as a local glutton and a pair of cubs in need of adoption. They soon learn to love every moment with family- including old man Boomer and animal friends.</p>
<p>Based on a true story, this movie is great family fare. For their young daughters health a city dwellers family, (the Robinsons,)leave their modern life behind for the wide open spaces and pristine beauty of an old mining camp in the Rockies. There are many adventures awaiting them with some adorable (and NOT so adorable) visitors including a gruff old mountain man named Boomer, whom they come to love like family. They adopt a pair of orphaned bear cubs as well as a pair of playful raccoons and a full grown bear. Pumas, bears, wolves and a windstorm are some of the dangers they face, including a serious threat to their young daughter's health.</p>
<p>A family flees the city for the wilderness. They learn to live with nature and more importantly, that when one has family, one has everything.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this film as a child - and was brought up in the Rocky Mountains, backpacking with my Dad, and can relate to the feeling of wanting to drop everything and "head for the hills."Have seen the movie and its sequel recently, I can still say it is a movie I would love for my children to watch and love. It is wholesome, family value oriented, and in general, a great joy for kids. It makes you want to go out camping and enjoy what little wilderness we have left in the US. While I do have to agree with other posters that you simply can't "up and leave" as they do in this film (ie - no preparation re: hunting, fishing, planting, learning, etc.), you just can't fit all that into a film. And it would bore the kids to death. It is a family/children's film, after all, not an adult action flick.I highly recommend this film to anyone with children.</p>
