<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent movie about the wonderful culture of those in Borneo and the warriors of the Malaysian continent. Awesome message on the effects of hate and war.....excellent analogy of " Salt" & message about " Life". The scenery and acting in my opinion makes this film a hidden treasure, I'm sorry to say, but it took me way to long to discover this movie ......the movie was made in 1989 and I was finally able to view it in 2008. Late Bloomer ! I study the culture of this country and I find it to be a fantastic piece of information that I can add to my video library.This movie is in my top 3 ultimate favorites list...right next to "13th Warrior" and "Braveheart"...... Excellent movie</p>
