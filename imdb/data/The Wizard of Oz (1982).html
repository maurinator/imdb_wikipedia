<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Judy Garland.  And her version of THE WIZARD OF OZ from 1939 is classic.  But it's not at all faithful to the book.  This production is.  The animation isn't great, and it's obviously not a flawless production, but it's lovingly done, has decent songs, and above all, is FAITHFUL to the book.  Yes, there is a book.  Yes, people have actually read it.  Everyone's seen the movie but few people have bothered to read the book.  If they had, they'd discover that OZ was a much more whimsical place, it really existed, it wasn't some dream.  And this production is very true to the spirit of the novel.  And Aileen Quinn is adorable, I wish she'd return to the movies, what a fabulous voice at such a young age.</p>
