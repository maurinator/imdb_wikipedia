<h1>The Eddy Duchin Story (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the late 20's, the talkative newly graduated in pharmacy and aspirant piano player Eddy Duchin comes from Boston to New York expecting to play with the orchestra of Leo Reisman at fancy New York's Central Park Casino. However he had misunderstood the invitation of the maestro and while leaving the place, he meets the wealthy socialite Marjorie Oelrichs that asks Leo Reisman to give a chance to Eddy. He plays in the intermission and becomes a successful piano showman. Two years later, Marjorie and Eddy get married and in the Christmas, Marjorie has a baby, Peter, but she dies after the delivery. Eddy rejects Peter blaming him for the death of Marjorie and only five years later he meets his son. With the World War II, Eddy Duchin breaks up his band and enlists to fight in the war. With the end of the war, Eddy returns to New York with the intention of getting closer to Peter but he sees the boy connected to his friend Chiquita. When Eddy discovers that he has a terminal disease, he proposes Chiquita and they get married.</p>
<p>In the early 1930s, Bostonian Eddy Duchin, just having graduated from pharmacy school, decides instead to go to New York City to pursue his dream of becoming a rich and famous pianist, especially as he has a standing job offer from band leader Leo Reisman to play in his band which performs at the Central Park Casino. Reisman had heard Eddy's makeshift band play while Eddy was still in college. Despite Eddy's easy-going performing style and natural charisma on stage, the job offer is not as he believes. Eddy does, however, manage to rise to professional musical renown with the help of who becomes his biggest booster, New York socialite and interior designer Marjorie Oelrichs, who works because she does not want to be beholden to easy money. But Eddy's life in New York does not end up as he wants due primarily to a personal tragedy. He runs away from everything associated with that tragedy, which he believes was his own doing. It becomes easier to do so with the onset of WWII. But when Eddy decides to embrace life again - especially one specific outcome of that tragedy - Eddy finds that it is not as easy as he would like. He may be able to understand how to find that happiness he so desires the second time around with the help of Englishwoman, "Chiquita" Wynn, unless...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The fine musical scenes and Tyrone Power's excellent performance are among the highlights of THE EDDY DUCHIN STORY, filmed in spectacular CinemaScope and containing lavish production values and fine performances from its cast. It's sensitively directed by George Sidney, a veteran director of M-G-M musicals, andas one reviewer may have pointed outthe film is indeed a lovely Valentine to Eddie Duchin's memory.The film is a delight to watch and is highly enjoyable yet quite tragic in places. However, there are flaws within the film due to the sentimental music score and some unbelievably saccharine and fanciful scenes. But the fine performances and direction, as well as the beautifully filmed music sequences, make up for such flaws. I felt the same way about the George Gershwin biopic, RHAPSODY IN BLUE (1945).Tyrone Power's performance as the talented and popular pianist is one of Ty's very best performances. Although Ty's looks remain middle-aged throughout the entire film, his transition from a young pianist in the 1920s to a World War II veteran battling leukemia is entirely believable. The film was a box-office hit in 1956 and was nominated for four Oscarsbut sadly, Tyrone Power was not nominated. I presume that it had to do with his "pretty boy" matinée idol roles at 20th Century-Fox in the past, which were roles that Ty hated playing and did little to enhance his reputation as an actor.THE EDDY DUCHIN STORY is well worth watching, even more so for its piano sequences. And did I mention the hauntingly gorgeous Kim Novak? She stole my heart for about a half-hour, and she and Ty have nice chemistry together...even though she and Ty did not get along very well off-camera.</p>
