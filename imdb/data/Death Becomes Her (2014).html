<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>April takes her first day off of work.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As hopeful as I'm sure we all are for April, I feel with the inclusion of Richard being within his last weeks, as well as Leo being terminal, there is this creation of a "Will they or won't they?" For it could very well be that through April we will see tragedy, death, and surely get a lot of tears, but the question is: will we ever have to mourn her? Something April herself fears for with chemo just an episode or two away, there is the possibility that it doesn't work, her getting a bone marrow transplant not working, and ultimately we could watch a final season where she is forced to accept she will die. Though, it could very well all end happy for her and the cancer storyline could end up being one huge arc before they transition to rebranding the show. Who knows?Topic 1: Sibling Chat (Part 1)  Brenna and NatalieWith Brenna joining the Eco club, mostly to spend time with Greer, comes the opportunity to head down to Florida where her half-sister Natalie lives. Someone who she wants to visit not just due to curiosity, but also because she could be a match for a bone marrow transplant for April. And with Greer being the best gal pal a girl can have, it seems Brenna's curiosity becomes part of her and Greer's to do list.But here is the thing about showing up unannounced to someone's house, especially when they lived their life as the secret child, they aren't too welcoming. At least at first. For, you see, Natalie long ago tried to get in contact with her siblings, possibly around the time of her dad's death, but as revealed in Topic 2, she didn't seem to receive a warm welcome. So she is a bit curt with Brenna upon meeting her. Though with her learning her older sister April has cancer, she does warm up to Brenna a bit. However, you can see that the whole situation with her being the secret child, not getting the support, both financial and parental, that Brenna and April did is going to make any possibility of a relationship an uphill battle. Especially since, in Natalie's mind, Brenna and April are privileged girls who don't know the meaning of struggle, much less are even capable of understanding, or trying to understand, what she went through. And, I got to say, telling someone one of the main reasons you wanted to meet them was so that they can get tested to be a donor is a bit much to ask of a stranger. Even if she is your sister.Topic 2: Sibling Chat (Part 2)  Sara and GeorgeDespite it seeming like Sara and the support group wasn't going to work out  period, it seems she is up for what they are offering now and even plans to go out on a boat with them. But then you can see her lose a bit of this joy when she sees George. For while they are increasingly cordial, and by the end of the episode you can tell their relationship has been mended, there is still a bit of unease between them.Though, finally, a lot of it gets explained. In a past episode I based the blame solely on George being responsible for Thomas' death, but the reality of the situation is that Sara seemed more hurt by the fact Natalie was kept a secret from her more than anything. Especially since before George became her brother in law, they were close friends. And by close friends, I mean she was friends with him before she even dated Thomas. Though, I got to admit, I feel her banning him from his brother's funeral, and ostracizing him from his nieces, just makes this situation seem increasingly peculiar. If just because you'd think it wouldn't take more than a decade, or so, for the family to have mended things. But, as they say, the quickest way to bring a family together is the death, or in this case the pending death, of a loved one.With that said though, Natalie mentioned she met Sara a long time ago and I am so hoping we get to see those scenes of Sara finding out soon.Topic 3: Leo's Make a Wish Foundation  April & LeoWith Leo terminal, and rich, it seems he wants to quickly build a legacy, even if just amongst the cancer support group, of providing an adult version of the Make a Wish foundation. Which included giving Meg the opportunity to strip and feel sexy again; letting terminal Richard get to go to his own funeral; and of course providing April the hope that she may one day have kids by paying the $5000 for her eggs to be frozen. And, as expected, with Dominic gone and Leo being very charming, the two end up hooking up. Which, again, I hope is only to make his death more impactful. For while I have nothing against the guy, and he is growing on me, I really want a good gut punch from this show and Leo maybe the only one who can provide it.Plus, imagine if she has a full on relationship with Leo and around the time he dies Dominic comes back. Making for a seriously complicated reunion for between April seeing someone she loves die, Dominic coming back to learn she has cancer, and then her dealing with falling in love while she and Dominic were on a "break," it would make for such good stories!</p>
