<h2> Summaries </h2>

But in the process, Vetter and Hicks have to fight their way up the chain to get to Diablo but it's easier said than done when all Vetter can focus on is revenge...</p>
<p>A man known as Diablo emerges to head a drug cartel after the previous leader is imprisoned.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A slightly below average movie. The film starts off well enough, but it soon gets entangled into scores of clichés as old as the cinematic art itself. Another drawback in this motion picture is Diesel's acting (mind you, I had just praised his work in 'Knockaround guys' a couple of days ago). It is not up to par, he does not manage to inspire any feeling for his character in the viewer, thence we cannot sympathize with his pain. The plot itself is a cliché in it's own way, there is nothing new there to awaken our curiosity, and considering that the screenplay, production, camera and Direction are all nothing more than average, we are left with a product that will not remain in our memories for very long.</p>
