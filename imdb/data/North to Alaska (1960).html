<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Wayne plays Sam McCord, who teams up with George Pratt, played by Stewart Granger, striking it rich with a gold mine around the turn of the century in Alaska. Fabian plays George's younger brother, Billy. George sends Sam back to Seattle to bring back his bride to be; instead, Sam brings back a chorus girl played by Capucine.Henry Hathaway directs this fist swinging comedy. Of course, Mr. Wayne is in charge of the fist fights and Fabian is the butt of and source of most of the comedy. Comic Ernie Kovacs plays a snide claim jumper.  Fast paced frolic of a picture. An enjoyable lighter side of 'Duke' Wayne.</p>
