<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sadly this piece is loaded with talent but gives the impression that the project was managed by a committee.I suspect it will serve a good piece of social history if you don't waste a lot of time worrying about the story lines.If the DVD had been released with more confidence it might have been nice to have some literature in the packaging. Can you spot I was desperate for some clues here?It gets a 3 because of the sterling efforts of Denise Van Outen and maybe Ray Winstone. I am a big fan of Armando Iannucci who I suspect had spotted the absence of direction and must have written his story in his coffee break?</p>
