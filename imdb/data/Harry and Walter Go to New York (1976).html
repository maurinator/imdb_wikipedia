<h1>Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two hoplessly out of their class con-men attempt to pull off the largest bank heist of the l9th century. They gain the enmity of the most famous bank Robber in the world and the affection of a crusading newspaperwoman.</p>
<p>It's 1892. Harry Dighby and Walter Hill are a Massachusetts based third rate vaudeville team and penny-ante con artists who pilfer money from audience members to supplement their meager income. They often feud with each other because of their differing perspectives and personalities. But they both have the same primary goal of making it big in vaudeville. Adam Worth is a renowned New York socialite and ladies man who also robs banks, the latest being the Lowell Bank and Trust. He has a standing agreement with New York bank presidents that after the robberies, he keeps the cash but returns the securities for a 15% face value fee minus a modest commission for the bank president. Harry and Walter meet Adam when they are assigned cell-mates during their incarceration for their latest crimes at Concord Prison. As Adam manages to arrange to continue living lavishly inside prison, Harry and Walter become his menservant. What Harry and Walter learn is that Adam has a copy of the blueprints for the redesigned Lowell Bank and Trust, now reported to be the most impenetrable financial institution. Adam plans to rob the bank again to satisfy his ego in that he can do it, but also to get back at the bank's president, Rufus T. Crisp, who was responsible for his capture. Much against Walter's sensibilities, Harry senses an opportunity to get a copy of the plans in order for him and Walter to rob the bank first. They manage indirectly to get a copy of the plans but destroy the originals in the process, and subsequently escape from prison. Adam finds out about the copy and does whatever he can to get the plans back from Harry and Walter. But unexpectedly on Harry and Walter's side are Lissa Chestnut, the emancipated publisher of the New York based socialist Advocate newspaper, and her associates at the newspaper. She inadvertently helped Harry and Walter get the plans, but does whatever she can to rob the bank with them in the name of the common man and to avenge an action against her and the newspaper by Adam.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when it was first released, then again on television sometime in the Eighties. Why this film is largely forgotten is beyond me. For that matter, why are some of the most entertaining films of the Seventies collecting dust, while the critics continue to insist that we bow and scrape to pretentious self-absorbed WoodyBogdanovichMazurskyAltman? Anyhoo, this film is funny -- maybe not side-splitting, but certainly a lot more entertaining than many films calling themselves comedies. It's atmospheric, with that yellow/sepia look Coppola first introduced in Godfather II. It's well-acted: James Caan is a great comic actor -- let's face it, a great actor, period. Michael Caine is especially good as the kid glove villain. Almost nothing here to offend anybody, (but kids under age 10 might have trouble following it). And after all these years, I still remember the "owls who" joke.</p>
