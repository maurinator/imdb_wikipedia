<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't say 'Matilda' was one of my favorite Roald Dahl books as a child but the movie adaption isn't that bad. Matilda is a very bright and intelligent for a girl of her age. She's quite different from her grouchy and ignorant parents. Danny DeVito was good as Matilda's grouchy father, he often plays very grouchy characters. Mrs Trunchbull is as scary as she is in the book. She's worse than mean. She's a deranged and aggressive monster! She's an absolute monster! She hates children and does nothing except bully and intimidate them. As for Mrs Jennifer Honey she's the exact opposite of Mrs Trunchbull. She's kindest and sweetest teacher you could find. She's like a mother to her school children and tries to protect them, but unfortunately she to is intimidated by Mrs Trunchbull. So when Matilda develops these telekinetic powers, it is up to her to teach Mrs Trunchbull an ultimate lesson. I really liked the relationship Matilda has with Mrs Honey. It reminds me of the relationships I had with certain teachers at school. So I would say this movie is both frightening and touching at the same time.</p>
