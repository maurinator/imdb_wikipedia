<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Trying to compare Two Days in the Valley with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is pointless.  There is very little originality in the vast majority of modern movies; by and large within their particular genre most movies are variations on a theme.  I've watched Pulp Fiction several times and enjoyed it every time and I'll probably watch it many times more.  I watched Two Days in the Valley and never once thought about PF, because I enjoyed it and accepted it as just another variation on a theme that was worth watching....and I'll more than likely watch it again....for its entertainment value.  The characters were believable in a many-threaded plot that finally knitted together in a way that did not seem contrived.</p>
