<h1>I'll Never Forget You (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An American physicist, Peter Standish, lives in London in an inherited flat on Berkeley Square, unchanged from its 18th century appearance. He's researched his ancestors and the flat, and he believes somehow he will travel through time, if only briefly, to 1784. A lightning strike transports him, and he finds things disturbingly different than he expected: disease and social conditions appall him, and, in this Age of Reason, his speech, manners, and knowledge frighten rather than interest all except one young woman, Helen, the sister of the woman he's to marry. He sets up a laboratory in the hopes of hastening progress, and he tells her his secret. Does love or Bedlam await?</p>
<p>A scientist obsessed with the past transports himself back in time to 18th-century London, where he falls in love with a beautiful young woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in 1951, when I was seven years old. Because several scenes remained engraved on my mind, years later, when I recalled those scenes, I was able to identify the stars (Tyrone Power and Ann Blythe). Heaven knows how I remembered the name of the movie. I am DYING to see it again because of the powerful impression it made on me as a little girl. I scour the TV Guide regularly, but so far no luck. Does anyone have any idea who owns this movie? I keep hoping Turner will find it in some lot of films he buys and show it on his TCM station.</p>
