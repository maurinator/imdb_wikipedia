<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember the first time I saw this movie.  It was around the time that my fascination for 60's British films started.  I was transfixed by the portrayal of day to day life in 60's London.  It was grim and miserable but everyone got on with life.Polly (Suzy Kendall) plays the little rich `Chelsea Girl' trying to fit into the working class by moving to Battersea, finding a job in a factory, befriending sisters Sylvie (Maureen Lipman) and Rube (Adrienne Posta) and finds Peter (Dennis Waterman) the Mod delivery boy as a boyfriend.  She moves into a rundown flat whilst trying to shake off the priviledged life she had with her family on the other side of the Thames.   Polly tries to create her own working class life even though her choices do not necessarily reflect those of the working class she was trying to emulate.This is a classic fly on the wall film and the scenes of the women talking whilst at work in the factory are brilliant.  Who could forget the scene at the pub on Friday night when Slyv and Rube get up with the band to give the crowd a `belter'.  Watching it is almost like being part of the crowd.This film must have been pretty hard hitting when it was released in 1967. Abortion - which had only been legalised - played a big role in the film. Hylda Baker who plays the abornist Mrs McCarthy and plays the role so well, even though it was probably a cruel act of typecasting.  Domestic violence was also portrayed in a hard hitting way even by todays standards.For me this film is firmly planted at the top of my all time favourite 1960's films followed closely by  `A Taste of Honey', `Smashing Time', `Saturay Night Sunday Morning' and `Blowup'.  If you haven't seen this film Â– try and get a copy on video if you can and make up your own mind.  I honestly believe this is one of the best 60's films produced in Britain, including the clothes, the soundtrack and Adrienne Posta's eyeliner!</p>
