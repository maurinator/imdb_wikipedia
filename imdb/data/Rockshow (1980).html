<h1>Rockshow (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1975 and 1976 Paul McCartney and Wings undertook the epic Wings over the World tour, the largest scale tour they would ever undertake as a band. From this tour came both the legendary "Wings over America" triple live album and the concert film "Rockshow". Although filmed on this tour at the enormous Kingdome in Seattle, "Rockshow", originally a cut down version of the concert, was not premiered until November 1980 in New York and April 1981 in London. It was released on Betamax and later on laserdisc. Now for the first time the complete full length concert is being made available fully restored from the original 35mm film and with restored & remastered sound, including a 5.1 mix for the first time. This is Paul McCartney and Wings live on stage in a concert that is destined to live forever!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rockshow, the film which is in fact different from "Wings Over America", is one of the late seventies best concert films. No it isn't state-of-the-art by current standards, far from it, but it can be found in very good quality if one is dogged in pursuit. That is what I'm reviewing here. I have a quite good DVD transfer of the film and the sound is very good - considering all things. I say this because it allows a closer inspection. Paul is obviously very happy to be in the structure of a band, his band this time. The joy he is experiencing in being the master of his destiny is apparent.Many thought, especially at the time, that it was pure indulgence to include his wife Linda. In retrospect, and by examining this performance as well as revisiting his Wings albums, Linda was most assuredly up to the task. Wings was a crack band. Jimmy McCulloch was a very versatile and talented guitarist/song-writer/vocalist, Denny Laine should have been a star in his own right and not just remembered by the masses as the guy who with The Moody Blues sang their first and second best single of all time, Joe English had the power of Keith Moon with a penchant for embellishing that power with fantastic cymbal work, and finally Linda really did have chops as a keyboardist and her background vocals somehow blended far better than she ever got credit for. Simply put: This band rocks with a vengeance and takes no prisoners and those in 1976 who were fortunate enough to be at any of their shows seem to uniformly testify to this.Rockshow is a fantastic concert film. If you can find a good copy that will be your verdict even if you are a hard-case. Paul had assembled some fantastic pop songs as only he could and he was excited to be playing them live - it shows. There is also great balance to the aural assault as Paul added a blue-chip horn section which really sweetened it, but yet the music still has a definitely edgy dirty rock and roll feel. Long before that once dedicated music network came up with their innovation of live acoustic set Paul did it right here and it is good as it gets plus it paces the concert nicely.I have nothing but compliments for Rockshow. I have no idea why Paul hasn't decided to remaster the entire show, add extras, and release it for his legions of fans. Paul is quite generous in his later years in making pro-shot performances available in the public domain as well as releasing a steady diet of current tour shows, this gives one hope one day this will again surface and in a quality never before imagined. Until that time I feel fortunate to have a good copy and I love to pull it out regularly. Please Paul do hear your fans requests and re-release it! Rockshow is a fantastic concert film for the ages.UPDATE: Thank you Paul! I got the Blu-Ray in 2013 and it is utterly fantastic.</p>
