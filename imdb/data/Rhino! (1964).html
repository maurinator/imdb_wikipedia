<h1>Rhino! (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A zoologist working to save the endangered animals of Africa has problems with poachers and local tribesmen who don't understand his methods. But, with the help of the local district nurse, he shows that capturing endangered animals and releasing them in protected game reserves is preferable to killing them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are parts of this movie that are not just silly; they are painfully silly. The way the scene where rhino's chases the two male stars around were almost laughable. In the scene, all you can see of the rhino's is their heads; and while watching these scenes I could in my minds eye back away from the shot; and see the rhino head on a stick connected to a wheeled cart being pushed around by members of the crew. And the rhino's seem to be not putting much effort into their chase. There also were a couple poorly staged scene's involving snakes. And one last criticism; the editing is choppy, some of the cuts leave you scratching your head thinking "what just happened" All that being said I enjoyed this film. It is after all based on fact. I liked the characters, and the wild life scenes were amazing. I was impressed with the way these actors interacted with the anesthetized animals. In most movies like this the big stars stand back while the "natives" actually get close to, or touch the animals. Both Gaurdino and Culp were, in a couple scenes standing right with not yet fully doped animals; these scenes were unlike anything I can remember. These scenes really drew me into this film. It's not ofter you see the pampered stars who act bravely in scenes with special effects; doing scenes with real animals. The crowning glory was Shirley Eaton (the Golden Girl); she wasn't completely convincing in the role, but who cares it's Shirley Eaton. This film surprised me. It was just the next film on TCM and came on in the background while I was doing something else. I almost changed channels, and I'm glad I didn't. All and all this is and interesting film, with characters you will like, and care about what happens to them. Robert Culp was good, but for my money Guardino stole this flick. You'll only be sorry if you miss this film.</p>
