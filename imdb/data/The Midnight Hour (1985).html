<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen this movie several times, and would like to say to this day it still remains one of my favorites. I like it so much because I love vampires and things like that. It was also the first so called vampire movie that made me laugh and had a real point behind it. I would like for my kids to see it before they start thinking their mom is a head case (you know talking about a movie that doesn't exist). I would like to buy it (so I can watch over & over), but can't find it anywhere. And believe me I have looked everywhere I could think of. Most people I ask look at me like I have stripes on my face. Can anyone help me find it????</p>
