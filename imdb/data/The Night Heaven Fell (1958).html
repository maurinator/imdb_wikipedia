<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although this movie has much to do with the Spanish sense of pride and honor, its real issue is a fierce competition between the beauty of Brigitte Bardot and that of the landscape of Southern Spain. As Bardot's performance is pretty uninspired here, this time the scenery wins. 'Les bijoutiers du clair de lune' makes good watching for its enjoyable shots. As for Bardot, she certainly did better in other movies.</p>
