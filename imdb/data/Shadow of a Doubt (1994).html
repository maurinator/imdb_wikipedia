<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Even Aladdin thought the sultan's visitor, a sultana showing interest in his toy collection, might be a suitable match, but she turns out to be nobody else then evil sorceress Mirage. Worse, she brought Agrabah a black magical 'gift': a giant black obelisk, the shadow of which makes everything it touches disappear, and nothing Genie tries can break or move it. Then Mirage tells Aladdin the only remedy is the mirror which reflects the truth behind the appearance, to be found on the roof of the world. The gang minus Genie fly till they find the ice cage full of mirrors, and Aladdin chooses one which shows him back in street rat costume. When they return and the mirror successfully removes shadow and obelisk, Princess Jasmine finds her fear was justified that's all too easy: now Mirage tells her true plan was to create an elaborate trick-reality to mislead them while the real Agrabah is wiped out, but Genie and Aladdin also have a surprising trick up their sleeves...</p>
