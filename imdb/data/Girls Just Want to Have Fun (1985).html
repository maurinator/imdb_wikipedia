<p>Janey is new in town, and soon meets Lynne, who shares her passion for dancing in general, and "Dance TV" in particular.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this movie - I've seen it probably a hundred times. Besides the all-star cast of Sarah Jessica Parker, Helen Hunt, Shannen Doherty and Jonathan Silverman - it's just a fun movie! The dancing is good - the music is fun! I just love it!!!</p>
