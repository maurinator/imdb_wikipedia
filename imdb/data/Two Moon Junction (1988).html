<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>April has just graduated from an exclusive Southern college. She's just returned home to her family mansion to prepare for her semi-arranged marriage to "the right man", a man approved by April's father, a Senator. During a trip to the local fair, April meets Perry, the kind of man she always wanted but never knew. Her parents are aghast, as Perry is exactly the kind of man they don't want her associating with. April must reconcile the expectations of her family and her fiancée with the passion she feels for Perry.</p>
<p>April is a shy, beautiful young southern girl who is engaged to a handsome wealthy man named Chad. April loves him, but one day, April and her sisters go to a local carnival and meets a muscle bound worker named Perry. April doesn't think much of him at first. April parents who are both respected politicians, leave town for a few days and April stays with her cankerous grandmother Belle, but April is more closer to Belle's housekeeper Delilah and asks her to cover for her while April goes back to the carnival. Belle, aware of what she is going to do, asks Sheriff Hawkins to spy on her. April returns to the carnival to find Perry, drunk and disordered. Perry's friend, Patti Jean asks April to go with her on a night on the town, so Perry can sober up. While April and Patti Jean are gone, Perry's enemy and carnival gambler Smiley!</p>
<p>A young Southern débutante temporarily abandons her posh lifestyle and upcoming, semi-arranged marriage to have a lustful and erotic fling with a rugged drifter who works at a local carnival.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this movie! In fact I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end. Richard Tyson was beyond hot and Sherilyn Fenn was beautiful. Both were sexy, sensual and desirable and played their part perfectly. I loved the chemistry between these two characters and I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline so much so I wished it was longer. I found each character brought a little something to the story, but not enough to detract from the central focus of the plot. The soundtrack I found to be very haunting and although I knew it was pure instrumental when I bought it, I still wish there were the other few songs that weren't included from the movie. I would love for there to be a special edition DVD of the movie, perhaps with extra footage of deleted scenes and other bonus features. The ending was great, but what would have really made it better was if April didn't marry Chad, (which I assume is what she did due to the wedding ring that we saw on her finger at the end of the movie in the shower scene) and instead ran of to be with Perry. At least that's what I would have done!</p>
