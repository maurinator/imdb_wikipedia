<p>'There are many that believe that Elvis is still alive - if he is alive he wears a mask and goes by the name Orion' Nashville News 1979 ORION tells the story of Jimmy Ellis - an unknown singer plucked from obscurity, and thrust into the spotlight as part of a crazy scheme that had him masquerade as Elvis back from the grave. With an outlandish fictional identity torn from the pages of best selling novel Orion by Gail Brewer Giorgio, the backing of the legendary birthplace of rock 'n roll Sun Records and a voice that seemed to be the very twin of Presley's himself, the scheme - concocted in the months after Presley's death exploded into a cult success - and the 'Elvis is alive' myth was begun. Our story revels in the manipulative schemes of the music industry, the truth and lies at the heart of the story, the allure of fantasy and the eternal search for identity. Orion proves that fact is indeed 'stranger than fiction'. This is the story behind that story. Who was that masked man?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As I sat watching "Orion: The Man Who Would Be King", I kept wondering if this film was a mockumentary...a fake documentary about a person that never actually existed. So I checked and it turns out he was definitely a real semi-celebrity and his albums are still available through Amazon! Funny...but I never heard about this guy before seeing this documentary.This film is about a guy named Jimmy Ellis a guy who sounded remarkably like Elvis when he sang. Because of this and an obscure book about a singer named 'Orion", a sleazy promoter got a great idea to put a mask on Jimmy, have him grow his hair like Elvis and then let people THINK he was Elvis and Elvis had actually NOT died. Now they never, ever said he was Elvis...but they certainly did a lot to imply it and let people believe it because they wanted to. Now this never resulted in mega-stardom for Ellis (his highest charting song was #63) but he had a steady stream of super-devoted fans. The only trouble is, Jimmy didn't want to be a faux Elvis...he wanted folks to like him for himself. So what's next? Well, I won't say other than the story is pretty sad...and something you certainly don't NEED to see. Mildly interesting and not much more.</p>
