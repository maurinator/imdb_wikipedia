<h1>The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A pirate ship, fighting in 1588 on the side of the Spanish Armada, suffers damage and must put into a village on the British coast for repairs. The village is small and isolated and the Spanish convince the villagers that the English fleet has been defeated and that they, the Spanish, are now their masters. This results in the villagers' sullen cooperation, but rumors and unrest begin to spread and soon the Spanish pirates find themselves facing a revolt.</p>
<p>A damaged privateer deserts the Spanish Armada and makes land for repairs near a village on the British coast, terrorizing the local inhabitants.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Made in 1964, this action romp (set on land) is one of Hammer's few forays beyond the world of horror.Christopher Lee is on crisply villainous form as Captain Robeles, whose modest privateer Diablo comes off worse when the Spanish Armada gets a sound shoeing and has to limp into hiding in the marshes near an isolated English village.To carry out repairs and escape safely, he and his crew hit on the wizard prank of terrorising the villagers into believing the Spanish won the engagement and that they represent the new authority.It's all done on a shoestring but certainly doesn't look it and boasts all the usual Hammer trademarks of solid if slightly dull hero, heaving bosoms, weak authority figures, cowed locals and a meaty villain.</p>
