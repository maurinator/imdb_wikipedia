<h1>The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bombolini is a fairly worthless drunk in the small Italian town of Santa Vittoria in the closing days of World War II. When word comes that the Fascist government has surrendered, he climbs a water tower to tear down the flag. He can't get down and someone gets the crowd to chant his name to give him confidence. The Fascist town council hears this and believes that he is the town's new leader. They surrender to him and make him the new mayor. He rises to the occasion and when he finds that the Germans plan to occupy his town and take their wine (over a million bottles) he works out a plan to hide it.</p>
<p>During WWII in Italy, a wine producing village hide a million bottles from the Germans</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Think you just turned 10 in a very small and provincial little village in the outskirts of Rome when one day of June 1968 the "AMERICANI" litterally take possession of the place. The only thing you know is they have chosen the place, ANTICOLI CORRADO, as a set for the latest Stanley Kramer's movie. Most of the peasants will work in it (average pay 5,000 Lira of those day, about 25 Euros nowdays), some of them will get big money for big troubles: the innocent place will never be the same eversince. Yet, even 35 years later, we Anticolani of those days still watch the movie with unlimited joy and endless nostalgia!!!</p>
