<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Simon Hartog's "Beyond Citizen Kane" is a remarkable and fascinating work that shows the dimension and the influence of Rede Globo in Brazilian's life (An influence larger than life). The documentary shows footages of the network in its greater moments and showing that behind all that glory and success lies a powerful company with tremendous power over people, including artists, politicians, and many others. Controversies enfolding the creation of the network, allies with the military regime during 20 years, false news and the infamous coverage of the presidential debate in 1989 are shown with the commentaries of several famous people, including ex-directors and reporters who have worked at Globo. This documentary was going to be released on theaters here in Brazil but because of Globo's power it was banned from release after one exhibition to the press, back in 1994. Never was shown in television. The Brazilians could only see this picture when several copies were posted on the internet (Globo doesn't own the internet as far as I know).The title it's a comparison between Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane") and Roberto Marinho president of Globo Corporation. Which is the same kind of power that both of these men held in their arms. Excellent film!</p>
