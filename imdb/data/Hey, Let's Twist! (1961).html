<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another film trying to capitalize quickly on the twist craze. This time it is Joey Dee and his 'Peppermint Twist' in the spotlight. An unimaginative little movie about two brothers turning their father's Italian Garden eating establishment into a money making dance club, the Peppermint Lounge. Of course the brothers have created an adaption to the twist, called the Peppermint Twist. Lip syncing is very bad. The script was probably rehearsed once or twice. But the close ups of twisting hips in tight capri pants makes up for all the short comings.Singers Joey Dee and Teddy Randazzo share the lead. Zorba Lampert is the cute 'bad' girl. Also in the cast are Jo-Ann Campbell and Kay Armen.Black & white tail shaker gives a glimpse at the culture of the early 60s.</p>
