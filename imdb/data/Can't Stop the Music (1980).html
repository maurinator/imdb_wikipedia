<h1>Can't Stop the Music (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this pseudo audio biography of the Village People, Jack Morell (a thinly disguised caricature of the group's founder, Jacques Morali) is a struggling composer desperate to gain fame with his songs, but all he needs is a group to sing them. With the help of his roommate Samantha and a lawyer named Ron, Jack forms a group of six "macho men" from his Greenwich Village neighborhood, and the rest of the film details their rise to fame from New York City to a climatic concert in San Francisco.</p>
<p>This is a pseudo autobiography of disco's The Village People.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I went to see this film almost the very first day it opened and along with "Fame" it is a recall mechanism for the start of an optimistic decade which like the acting in this film dive-bombed.The music and dancing however are of an almost Buzz Berkeley standard and they still bring most houses down.It really does not matter that the script makes no sense or that Guttenberg wants to forget he ever made the film, or that Jenner remained not the right type of male legs and torso-the stars are the wonderful Village People.They kick start the action with the song YMCA and we owe it to them to see this incredible routine in the swimming pool.They were all ready for the Eighties, shame that it didn't quite live up to everyone's hopes, but you will still find people who know a routine when they play old singles of YMCA. It's an electrifying trackand I'm not even gay. People were plain rude about Allen Carr...he had made Grease... he had every right to make what he liked... come hell or Fire Island.</p>
