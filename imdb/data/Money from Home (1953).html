<h1>Money from Home (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Herman owes a lot of gambling debts. To pay them off, he promises the mob he'll fix a horse, so that it does not run. He intends to trick his animal-loving cousin, Virgil, an apprentice veterinarian, into helping him. Of course, he doesn't tell Virgil what he is really up to. Mistaken identities are assumed, while along the way, Virgil meets a female vet and Herman falls for the owner of the horse. Goons and mobsters are also lurking around; so beware!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dean is in trouble. He owes money from gambling debts. (Why he doesn't pay off the debts by crooning those songs he's going to sing is a wonder). Jerry is an animal lover apprenticing with a vet. The mob as Dean to fix a horse they don't want to win. Dean is going to use Jerry to do this without telling him. Laughs ensue, there's two girls for the guy and a final race track scene that is up there with the great slapsticks of the Marx Bros, Chaplin etc</p>
