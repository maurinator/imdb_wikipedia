<h1>The Kidnapping of the President (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A South American quasi-revolutionary/guerilla/terrorist and a misled, admiring girl compatriot manage to kidnap the U.S. President during a diplomatic visit to Toronto. With a nondescript armored truck, crudely yet somehow elaborately rigged with high explosives (and the President trapped inside), the two terrorists keep the Secret Service at bay until in the end, Assanti is killed and Shatner has to find a way into the truck anyway.</p>
<p>During a visit to Toronto, the USA president is abducted by a crazed South American terrorist and held captive in an armored truck wired with explosives. A relentless secret service agent tries to rescue the president before midnight when the truck will detonate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable.  The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce.  There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life.  If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie.  It could have been decent if it was done differently.  Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.  Shatner's acting is okay. The production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired.  Overall, I think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.</p>
