<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Read reviews anywhere about the 1986 version of Miracles starring Terri Garr and you will either see terrible ratings or outstanding ratings. You seldom see any middle ground except in the averages of the reviewers. I thought I would add this thumbs-up rating to balance out the bad. I admit that if you are not in the mood for a comedy, forget this movie. There are no profound morals or insights into life. There is no social injustice righted. Few things in this movie would ever happen in real life. Yet, if you are in the mood for comedy, Miracles (1986) will certainly provide the motivation to laugh.Bad things happen to a recently divorced couple, but in the wake of their misfortunes are subtle "miracles" for others. Part of the humor comes from the fact that when faced with dangerous situations, this bickering couple is more concerned with complaining how each other is reacting to the dilemma than the gravity of the situation itself. There is a wide variety of comedic techniques from slapstick to subtle humor. This movie revolves around a recently divorced couple who have such fundamental differences that they would never get back together in real life. However, this is not real life. It is a romantic comedy where miracles can take place, especially in a movie that bears that name.I was in the mood for a comedy when I watched this movie, and I was not let down.</p>
