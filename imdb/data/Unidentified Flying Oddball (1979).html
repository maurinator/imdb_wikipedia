<h1>Unidentified Flying Oddball (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A NASA spacecraft proves Einstein right when, traveling faster than light, it ends up near King Arthur's Camelot. On board are big-hearted Tom Trimble and Hermes, the look-alike robot he built. Tom immediately makes friends with pretty Alisande and enemies with the awful knight Sir Mordred. It seems Mordred is out to oust Arthur, while Alisande's father is not the goose she believes him to be but is also a victim of Mordred's schemes. It's as well the Americans have arrived.</p>
<p>An astronaut and his android double travel back to the time of King Arthur.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An all-around fun movie for the adventurous and imaginative.  The Disney channel used to air this film regularly in the 1980's and I made sure to watch it each and every time.This is a great family film that is especially fun for young boys (what little boy doesn't want to be an astronaut or a knight?  How about BOTH!?). Just be sure your kids see this one before they become cynical from being corrupted by the numerous plotless special-effects laden films of today. Additionally, this is a great way to introduce kids to the literary world by providing them with the film's inspiration:  Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee in King Aurthur's Court."Enjoy!</p>
