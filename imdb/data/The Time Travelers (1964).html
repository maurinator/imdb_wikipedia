<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An aged and out of shape Preston Foster leads a small group of scientists through a time portal into a future where nuclear war has decimated the Earth and the few humans left are holed up in a mountain stronghold. Outside, hostile mutants roam the arid wasteland. The concept is fine, and the acting passable, but the cardboard sets are from hunger. Irwin Allen, never one to pass up an opportunity, stole the basic elements of this Ib Melchior movie for his "Time Tunnel" TV show. It also appears to have strongly influenced certain "Star Trek" episodes. The main reason to watch this moldy oldie is to see the lovely Merry Anders wearing skintight jumpsuits and also doing a nude shower scene. Several other undressed and semi-dressed Hollywood starlets are in the shower scene with her. Shot in color, which is a good thing, and a pretty decent musical score helps a lot. Worth a look for what passed for a sci-fi flick in 1965. Big changes in the genre were only a few years off, of course..</p>
