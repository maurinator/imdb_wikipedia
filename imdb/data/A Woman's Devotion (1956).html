<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had no idea what to expect, especially with two very different titles ("A Woman's Devotion" vs "Battle Shock"), but this film turned out to be quite entertaining.  Janice Rule (Estelle) and Rosenda Monteros (Maria) were very good, as was Paul Henreid (the police captain; he also directed this movie).Filmed in color on location in Mexico, this picture was visually rich and gave a great sense of place. There is a very frank, unglamourous fight between two male characters that is all the better for putting awkward realism over the choreographed look.The Mexican supporting cast, especially for the characters of Maria and the chief of police, did quite well. Smooth editing and good directing.  Only two problems - Ralph Meeker wasn't the best choice for the male lead, and the ending left me wanting a bit of denouement.Overall, very watchable and enjoyable, and I'd see it again.</p>
