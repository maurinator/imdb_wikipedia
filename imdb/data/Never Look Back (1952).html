<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Made at the Manchester Film Studios in the autumn of 1951, this is one of the best of the early Hammer productions before their name had become synonymous with Horror.Rosamund John is sympathetic and convincing as Anne Maitland, an ambitious barrister whom has taken silk, only to put old flame Guy Ransome (Middleton) up for the night, inadvertently providing him with an alibi for murder. Unwisely deciding to defend him, in her first case since becoming KC, she then finds current lover Nigel Stewart (Hugh Sinclair) leading for the prosecution.This is all made more plausible than it sounds by smooth direction from the prolific Francis Searle, with more vivid characterisation than usual in a film of this type, which has its share of lighter moments too. Hugh Sinclair who made several second features around this period, gives a typically accomplished performance and Guy Middleton a more sinister version of the upper-class playboy type he often portrayed. The court room scene is well done, witnesses include Arthur Howard as a flamboyant actor and sometime Carmen Miranda impersonator, Brenda de Banzie as a brassy tart and there's a nice turn from Bruce Belfrage as the judge. There's also one of the final appearances of veteran actor and former director of quota quickies Henry Edwards as a solicitor, while future star Harry H. Corbett appears fleetingly.</p>
