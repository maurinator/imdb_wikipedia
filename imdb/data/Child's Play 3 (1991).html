<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's been eight years since the events in the second film, we now see that Andy is a teenager who has been enrolled in a military school. Play Pals Toy Company decides to re-release its Good Guys line, feeling that after all this time, the bad publicity has died down. As they re-used old materials, the spirit of Charles Lee Ray once again comes to life. In his search for Andy, Chucky falls into the hands of a younger boy, and he realizes that it may be easier to transfer his soul into this unsuspecting child. Andy is the only one who knows what Chucky is up to, and it's now up to him to put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Chucky, the doll possessed by a serial killer, returns for revenge against Andy, the young boy who defeated him and who has since become a teenager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Boy, if you talk to anyone about this flick, you get polar opposites on whether it is the best or the worst in the series.Personally, I tend to fall with those who did not like it as well as the first two. There was something about Andy as a child that made the films interesting that was lost in the military academy crap. There was just too much BS with Cadet Lt. Col. Brett C. Shelton, Sgt. Botnick, and Maj. Ellis that detracted from the main story.Justin Whalin did a good job in the film, and Perrey Reeves was sweet, but the rest of the cast just didn't do anything for me.I did like the battle in the fun house, though.</p>
