<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brainscan is by far one of the most personally influential pieces I can recall from the Horror genre. I look back on this movie as what can be misinterpreted through the creative process, sheer possibility and the like. This movie took a very creative stance behind the usual blandness of a typical horror story and made what could be interpreted as a piece ahead of its time. In 1994, the internet was not what it once was, and peoples understanding of it was dim in a mass perspective.. so a lot of this film went misunderstood or unappreciated at the time it was released. Only now, through home video distribution and release can people take shots at it, but are they really justified? This is a generally stated low-budget film (Edward Furlong did it obviously because he had some sort of passion for the genre) and it was done with a certain degree of emotional intricacy. Look at the larger scope, don't feel embarrassed to admire what could have been, in itself a Horror-genre redfining era that just didn't click with mainstream "pop" perspective...</p>
