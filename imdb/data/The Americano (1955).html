<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Americano is an entertaining film which has an interesting story, but which could have been much better. It is hard to understand why after getting known actors like Glenn Ford, Cesar Romero, Abbe Lane and Ursula Thiess, the production seems so poor like it was done on a very small budget. Mato Grosso, in Brazil where the action occurs is an impressive place, and the cinematography does no justice to it. To enjoy the film you also have to overlook the fact that Ford as a Texan coming to a remote place in Brazil has no problems with the language because they all speak English, and instead of Portuguese, Spanish seems to be their native language!!! Abbe Lane does a spectacular dance number and just that is worth the film, it does not matter that the music is by Xavier Cugat and has nothing to do with Brazil. Ford brings bulls from Texas and after he delivers them and gets 25000 dollars, what does he do? He goes and sleeps in the jungle with the money. Guess what happens!!! If the film would have come out as originally intended, filmed in Brazil and directed by Budd Boetticher it could have been much better. Unfortunately bad weather, lack of financial resources, problems with the crew were responsible for only a minimal part of the finished movie (if any) to be filmed in Brazil.</p>
