<h1>Achante Bharya (1971)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you would like to see a Malayalam movie where Jose Prakash is not a villain and Ragini does not have a dance sequence, go an enjoy this two and a half hour long Ashok Productions family drama with some excellent piece of acting by Ragini, Joseprakash and K.P Ummar. This is a story of Thankamma ( Ragini ) who is the sole bread winner of six siblings including a grown up Vijayan ( K.P Ummar ) who she is determined to support his higher education with her humble income working as a household maid for a very compassionate family. The movie is all about Thankamma played magnificently by Ragini who has demonstrated her acting skills as a loving elder sister of her siblings, a wife devoted to her husband Contractor Karunakaran Nair ( Adoor Bhasi ) inspite of his animal like instincts and also providing a motherly love of her husband's children. Also K.P Ummar, Meena ( as Adoor Bhasi's mother) and Thankam Vasudevan Nair provided good acting in their support roles. The song sequence in the river was very well depicted with some excellent photography. The music is commendable and has some melodious numbers. Overall it is an enjoyable movie about a woman's struggle to survive in this world with special focus on how far a family can go to support higher education to make a meaningful life for one of their members.</p>
