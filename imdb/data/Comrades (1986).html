<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sorry that this is posted a little late but Film4 showed 'Comrades' at 12.20am on March 20th 2009, complete with advertisements unfortunately.The announcer said "now for a rare screening of a British epic", too right, I estimate it hasn't been on TV for 20 years.They do tend to show films more than once so it might be repeated in the next few weeks, probably in a graveyard slot again.Not sure if I enjoyed it as much as the first time around but the location filming and Dorset landscapes are stunning.Seeing as they released the Bill Douglas 'Trilogy' on DVD last year perhaps a release for this overlooked epic is in the pipeline?</p>
