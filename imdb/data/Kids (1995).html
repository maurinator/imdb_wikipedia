<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At first this just may seem like a pointless slice of 24 hours in a  teenager's life, but upon closer viewing it's points become very clear. The sex scenes are rather drawn out and some of the situations are very disturbing and very graphic, but there really is kids like this in real life. Film manages to make important statements about safe sex or avoiding sex all together, rape, and parental involvement. It's raw and it's shockingly realistic in it's treatment. A very important film.</p>
