<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Evil Aliens tells the story of a group of disreputable news unit who sets out to cover a bizarre story of alien abduction on an isolated island off the coast of Wales.If you're into movies that just don't let up on incredibly weird scenes, this is the movie for you. You get to see some sick stuff and also some funny stuff, usually combined. You want to see a human having intercourse with an alien? You can see it here. You want to see a violent anal probe? You can see it here.This is an independent film by Jake West, a guy who seems to have won countless number of awards for many low-budget films. The movie is handled in quite a professional manner and makes good use of obviously fake CGI. Somehow, he pulls it off so it doesn't feel so uninvited.As the movie progresses, your face will change into many different shapes. Some of the expressions may be... "cool", "what the hell?" and "ummm, I'm going to look over here... now". All in good ways. The movies takes so many good ideas (however messed up they may be) to the extreme, they don't hold back on anything. It's good to see something refreshingly new to the screen.Capped off with a stunningly entertaining ending, which is not common with these low-budget films. They usually seem to waste all of their money on the first half of the movie that they run out of money to complete their "great" ending. This is not the case with Evil Aliens as it is the best part of the movie.One of the best low-budget films I've seen in a long time. Keep an eye and ear out for all of the major film references, you should find some in there. It's very consistent, and should keep you there for the full 90 minutes.Good for a laugh with your friends.</p>
