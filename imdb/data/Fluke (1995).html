<h1>Fluke (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After a man dies in a car crash, he is reincarnated as a dog and attempts to reconnect with his family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is one of the saddest movies I've seen, just because of when the dogs are in trouble, and also when they're lonely or hurt.  I really like how the story is about a dog who is transformed into a human to find his family; it was pretty cool.  I would reccommend a big box of tissues for this movie-just to be prepared.</p>
