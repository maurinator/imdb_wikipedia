<h1>Twist of Fate (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ginger Rogers is in love with an international businessman, Stanley Baker, who is actually the head of a syndicate that mints illegal coins for the Continental market. But she soon learns that Baker has been deceiving her and has no intentions of divorcing his wife. So she meets Jacques Bergerac, a potter, and falls for him (onscreen and off). Into this little slice of life comes Herbert Lom, a confidence man, and he steals a bracelet that Baker had given Rogers and uses it to pay a debt. Enter a twist-of-fate (the US title that describes the film a lot better than the UK title, which is not unusual for films going from America to England but seldon vice-versa), and it ends up in Baker's hands. Strained creditabilty aside since many, many films depend on beating the coincidental odds, Baker assumes that Lom is Rogers' lover, and this sin't a good assumption on his part sinve Lom kills him and then makes it appear as if Rogers and Bergerac did the deed.</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers, an actress living with Stanley Baker on the Riveria, becomes involved with Jacques Bergerac and learns he is a dangerous criminal.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lively and Lovely to Look at Movie that moves rapidly here and there with Everyone trying to figure out Who is Who and What is What and is breathless to say the least. The Cast, including the Dramatization of Ginger Rogers Career is OK if nothing remarkable. It is the Action and the Intrigue that Star here.Some on location Photography and Criminal behavior Spice things up beyond the rather Bland Romance Angles. There are extended Fight Scenes, Misidentifications, Smuggling, Thievery, and Murder, Adultery, Betrayal, and after all, a Deathbed confession that thankfully, and predictably clears things up. There is enough here to recommend because once things get going it is all in Perpetual Motion that makes for a Fun Film Experience, although it fails to be sharp enough for it to rise above expectations, but it does manage to deliver just that.</p>
