<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am not sure which aspect of this marvellous episode is more amazing:the slow gentle yet unrelenting manner in which the bizarre plottwist from season 3 is resolved, the tension practically drips from each moment of the drama, the Emmy people can eat their hearts out or the fact that, when season 3 was wrapped up, the production companydid not know there would even be a next season, so this episode is a "bonus" for viewers in the true sense of the word.And the performances, omigawd, the performances.McRaney is one of the least appreciated but most seasoned TV actors in the game. He has been honing his craft since the 1960s and pretty much delivers the performance of his life here.And Taylor -- the Australian who acts like he actually grew up in the American west -- could not give a weak performance if you asked him All the cast act their hearts out in this one For a viewer, this episode is pure joy, 100% proof, don't operate heavy machinery after watching</p>
