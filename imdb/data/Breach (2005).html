<h1>Breach (2005)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom becomes the support for two people. First, Carlisle finally admits that Elaine has left him. Carlisle uses Tom both as his divorce lawyer (despite the fact that Tom does not specialize in divorce nor does he really agree to act as Carlisle's lawyer) and surrogate "friend". Tom is further burdened when Carlisle is unexpectedly hospitalized and thus Tom is forced to look after Elaine's beloved but temperamental dog, Lulu, who Carlisle refuses to place in a kennel. And second, Janice and Tom have been casually dating, and outwardly everything seems to be going all right. However, Tom still thinks about his deceased wife, Colleen. Tom "speaks to Colleen" while he's sleeping, but there's something more to Tom's pain than the fact that he misses Colleen or that he thinks about the suffering she endured with her illness prior to her passing. Tom finally admits to himself that although he loved her, their marriage, especially at the end, was by no means perfect. With that admission, he can counsel Carlisle to move on with his life, something that Tom decides to do with Janice.</p>
