<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All Filipino erotica movies from the past to the present have almost always taken their story premise and plot from 'Scorpio Nights', Peque Gallaga's masterpiece of poverty, love, and unquenchable libido.The movie tells the sexual adventures of Danny (Daniel Fernando), a youth who cannot seem to control his urges. Danny served as peeping tom to a childless couple just below his rented apartment. When he accidentally entered the couple's room, he was mistaken by the wife as his own husband and she willingly had sex with him. The steamy affair had turned into an obsession which led to the demise of all the lead characters.What made the film good was it evoked the painful realities of living below the average class during Philippine Martial Law era, to the extent that people find other ways to pleasure themselves. Also, the film successfully presented a negative consequence of overt sexual obsession.Never had the Philippines ever produced an indie-like classic such as this. All other erotic movies made after 'Scorpio Nights' were cheap imitations. Even its successor, 'Scorpio Nights 2' (with a different director) failed too much to live up to its predecessor.</p>
