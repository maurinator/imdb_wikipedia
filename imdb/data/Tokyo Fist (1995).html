<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>people compare this to raging bull I don't see any comparison other than it being a boxing film. The film it self has a basic plot of man is stalked by old friend, old friend steals girl, man goes crazy and decides to learn boxing. sounds simple right well if you know the director you know your in for a freaky acid trip similar to tetsuo the iron man not on the same level as its more believable. The violence is over the top and you need to work out some things on your own. In my opinion its more about the girl than either of the men but that's my opinion. I would also like to state that I hate boxing movies but I would recommend this film to everyone its fast paced and never gets dull also has that old grimy scan line look about it and some not bad cinematography so if your fan of the director and tempted to miss it due to the subject matter don't make that mistake.</p>
