Caufield invites Hardin to join the organization. Hardin proceeds to wrestle with his conscience, especially when he presides over the trial of two obviously guilty child molesters/murderers...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Star Chamber will remain one of my favourite films of all time.For years, we have been debating whether the legal system is just and worth defending, despite the fact that it occasionally sets free criminals on technicalities. This film certainly explores this issue sufficiently and gives an insight into the judges who are forced to set them free on vague technicalities; and how their conscience is severely effected when the rights of the worst criminals imaginable comes before the dispensation of justice.Through the Star Chamber, a group of frustrated judges that have their own way of seeing that justice is served on criminals who escape the weight of the law. But what seems like a reasonable and just solution to the flaws in the legal system turns out to be a nightmare for their newly elected member (Michael Douglas) as this powerful legal drama builds to a rather suspenseful and engaging conclusion. Excellent movie with magnificent performances, but (thankfully) without the over-dramatic Hollywood hogwash. Performances by the cast are as solid as they come.I hear that they are remaking the film. I'd be surprised if it even came close to this one.</p>
