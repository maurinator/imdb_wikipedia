<h1>Taza, Son of Cochise (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three years after the end of the Apache wars, peacemaking chief Cochise dies. His elder son Taza shares his ideas, but brother Naiche yearns for war...and for Taza's betrothed, Oona. Naiche loses no time in starting trouble which, thanks to a bigoted cavalry officer, ends with the proud Chiricahua Apaches on a reservation, where they are soon joined by the captured renegade Geronimo, who is all it takes to light the firecracker's fuse...</p>
<p>When peacemaking Apache chief Cochise dies, the Chiricahua Apaches are torn between following Cochise's peace loving son Taza and following the warlike renegade Apache warrior Geronimo.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>With Jeff Chandler doing an obligatory appearance in his most famous role as Cochise the torch is passed to a new generation of Apache leaders in the persons of his sons Rock Hudson and Rex Reason. But in the title role in Taza, Son Of Cochise, Hudson seriously takes his dying father's admonition to stay on the path of peace while Reason wants to join up with Geronimo.This rivalry spills over into their personal lives as Hudson and Barbara Rush are in love, but her war like father Morris Ankrum much prefers Reason as a new son-in-law. And when the guys come courting and have to come up with presents for the father-in-law for Rush's hand Ankrum prefers the stolen white man's wampum to the humdrum Apache style gifts that are the normal course in these things.Taza, Son Of Cochise was shot in 3-D which I'm sure must have really been exciting and effective during the battle scenes especially the climax battle. I'd have liked to have seen it in a theater rather than on YouTube. Hudson does well in the starring role.Western fans should be pleased though this is far from historically accurate.</p>
