<p>With Bombay being held to ransom by a daring jewel thief, the Police Commissioner has not only his hands full, but is also upset with his son, Vinay, as he has not learned any skills, and spends all his time examining stones and jewelery. He is pleased after Vinay secures employment with a leading jeweler, Vishamber Nath, and subsequently falls in love with his daughter, Anju. Then several people greet Vinay as "Amar" or "Prince Amar", and things come to a boil when a woman named Shalini comes forward and claims that Vinay is her fianc√©e. Vinay is able to prove that he is indeed Vinay, and cooperates to locate this elusive Amar - only to find himself embroiled in a devious scheme - that not only robs him of his sanity, his memory, identity, and makes him a target of every policeman in India and Nepal.</p>
<p>A Police Commissioner's son comes under suspicion for being a jewel thief.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Unlike Bond and other detective movies, Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.</p>
