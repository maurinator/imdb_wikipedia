<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When Fuller made this film he was influenced by "Rebel Without a Cause" for the role of John Ericson. He also placed sexual double meanings like when Barbara Stanwick describes a man as "everything with two feet and a gun". He also stated in his biography: "My forty guns were forty p---ks. My powerful heroine had her way in the sack with all forty, then cast them aside for the forty-first "gun", Griff." There are two scenes which are kind of surrealistic, the first at the beginning when you see Barbara Stanwick in a white horse followed by the forty men in dark horses wildly galloping. The second when Barbara is shown having dinner with the forty men in a luxurious giant table all of them impeccably dressed. That's the kind of scenes you would expect from Bunuel, who knew Fuller. By the way, the setting for this scene was from "Tara" of "Gone With The Wind" remodeled. Barry Sullivan, Gene Barry and Robert Dix are the three brothers who come to town and get in trouble with John Ericson, Barbara's brother and the sheriff Dean Jagger.Gene Barry falls in love with the beautiful Ziva Roddan. The final shootout is fantastic, Fuller got inspired by an incident that happened when he was fighting in World War 2. The Cinemascope in black and white is superb and the hysterical pace of the film keeps you constantly on the edge.</p>
