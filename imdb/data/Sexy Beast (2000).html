<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gal, Deedee, Aitch and Jackie, having left behind respective lives of ill-repute, bask in the sun of Spain and in the most essential brand of leisure. A hazy yarn of barbecues, beer and botched hunting expeditions make up their retirements, until a sudden and unforeseen disruption emerges from their past. Enter the childishly violent and hilariously edgy Don Logan. Through a series of side-splitting negotiations and irrevocable acts, retired crook Gal is forced to shake off the rust and accept one last mission, put forth by the menacing Logan, his ex-mentor. A heist of legendary proportion and personal implications, this job should make for one hell of an encore.</p>
<p>Gal, a retired gangster, lives a happy life with his wife Deedee in a beautiful house in Spain. Don Logan, a respected name with the mob and an old "friend" to Gal, suddenly shows up. He wants Gal to join him on this big strike in London together with a well picked out gang of respected gangsters. When Gal keeps turning him down, Don gets more and more threatening, no is not an answer. How far will Don go to get his will done? What options are there for Gal? Will this ever end?</p>
<p>Spain. Gal has retired from the gangster life, and is sunning himself placidly beside the pool at his villa when a boulder comes crashing by, barely missing him. Soon, he and his pal Aitch, together with their wives Deedee and Jackie, are being threatened by a human boulder, Don Logan. Logan wants Gal for a high-stakes vault break-in in London (masterminded by the cool and suave Teddy Bass), and he will not take no for an answer. Nevertheless, that's exactly the answer Gal keeps giving him, even as Don gets more and more threatening. Meanwhile, Gal is plagued by dreams of a menacing, hairy beast. Just how far will Don (and Gal) go in this battle of wills? And what of Enrique, the pool boy?</p>
<p>Brutal gangster Don Logan recruits "retired" safecracker Gal for one last job, but it goes badly for both of them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just don't know why this movie didn't get a large release in America despite Kingsley being up for yet another very justified Oscar. It manages to be tense, funny, and totally absorbing all at the same time. The story is told at breakneck speed and never lets up for a second. All the performances are incredible, most notably Ray Winstone, Amanda Redman and Lovejoy himself, Ian McShane, but as everyone points out, Kingsley just steals the show even when he is not onscreen. If this movie doesn't get a major big screen release in the States, it will be a crime larger than any job that Don Logan or Teddy Bass could plan.</p>
