<h1>A Matter of Time (2013)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a town forgotten by time, a secret is deeply hidden from the townspeople - the secret that everyone's lives are connected to clocks and if your clock breaks, you die. The last keeper of this secret leaves it to his grandson, Adam Eddington, who never wanted the responsibility of caring for the clocks... but the town's local sheriff does, claiming that the Eddingtons abused their power and that it is time for a new era. Can Adam accept his responsibility and his heritage before it is too late, or will a new day of tyranny and darkness rise over Valetown?</p>
<p>In a seemingly idyllic town, a secret is buried in a room of an ancient home: for every towns person there is a clock, and when the clock has ticked its last so does the heart.</p>
