<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Far North has some interesting character sketches. I think Jessica Lange plays an excellent role, and interestingly enough, she is from the area where the movie was made. I enjoy Charles Durning in movies; he always puts on a good show, and he is the highlight of this movie.  The plot is implausible, as are many of the scenes and situations, but that is what I find intriguing about it.  It isn't a serious movie; if you want serious find something else.  But if you want a unique and somewhat twisted plot in a new setting, see it.  It is a movie I can just relax and watch and get some good laughs.</p>
