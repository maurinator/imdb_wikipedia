<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This slightly jaded look at the film industry, and at love, is the work of Jay Presson Allen, who also wrote "Marnie", "Cabaret", and "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie". You will find her trademarks: fascinating characters and witty, insightful rapid-fire dialog.Her 20th Century women lack sugar-coating. But here, a lot of the action concerns the close ties of an unconventional family. This, along with the heroine's ironic first-person narration, give the story a lighter, less distant feel. However, the direction and pacing are uneven and the picture has been overlooked. A year after this film was released, Jay Presson Allen and Sidney Lumet wrote and produced Prince of the City, a much darker film about police corruption. It found a far warmer reception. And Alan King has a cameo, playing himself.</p>
