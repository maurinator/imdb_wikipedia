<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is fun B-Movie that follows the infinite that science can unleash. It has all the matin√©e and B-movie markings but don't let that eclipse the philosophy of a wise tale: Science Unbound will not be controlled by its maker, the scientist like a parent or artist can not keep a leash on its creation. For a great review of the film check out: "Sight & Sound" International Film Quarterly. Winter. 1990/91. Volume 60 No 1. Richard Combs article breaks down the review into four parts: 1.The Atom, New & Improved 2.There are parts of me in all my films. But which parts? 3. There are no eyes in the Unconscious 4. Who is God maybe?But a lot of people don't seem to care for this film, so be your own judge. I would rather not judge and just enjoy a story about Frankenstein that is way more entertaining than a lot of highly ranked movies on this database.</p>
