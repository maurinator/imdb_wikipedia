<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fabulous film tour of dirt and asphalt oval tracks around the country. Forget the story! A treat to see the days when you could tour the country making a living in a race car,by yourself and a small crew of dedicated sponsors and friends. A must see for any race fan. All you lefty artists will only see it asa sleeping pill. Pearls before swine. As a racer that ran at various tracks in the film,it cant be overstated hownostalgic a trip it is to see men and race machinery the way it was in the old days; incredible doses of fun,danger and adventure. I read about these days and heard stories, but you can see in the filming that the crews and driversare a snapshot of true racing history in this country. Mark my words,in twenty years they are going to worship films like this one. Enjoy it now and show a friend the way it was....</p>
