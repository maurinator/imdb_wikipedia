<h1>One Got Fat (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ten youth, all close friends, decide to cycle to a park nine blocks away to have a picnic lunch. As they proceed on their journey, they have to remember and pay attention to the many aspects of being a responsible cyclist and bicycle owner. These aspects include using correct hand signals to signify cycling intention, obeying traffic signs and signals, keeping to the correct side of the street, registering one's bicycle by licensing it, riding one person to a bicycle, not riding on sidewalks where prohibited and yielding to pedestrians wherever riding on sidewalks is allowed, keeping one's bicycle in good working order by having it tuned whenever required, and having lights and/or reflectors for dark situations which includes riding through unlit tunnels during the day. Acting the responsible human or the irresponsible "monkey" will affect who of the ten will arrive safely if at all to the park for the picnic.</p>
<p>This bicycle-safety film shows children what can happen when bicycles are driven carelessly and recklessly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm rating this a 9 because it is so hilarious, so out of the norm, that it actually works. In 1963 there were these weird public service announcements that were designed to scare the crap out of little kids. A group of monkey/kids (actual children with monkey tails and monkey masks) each do something wrong with their bikes, leading to death or mutilation. Each has a bag lunch with his or her name on it, and as they are destroyed, there is a close-up of their lunch bag. Edward Everett Horton, one of the most famous voice over guys of his time (remember "Fractured Fairy Tales) narrates in his kind of happy way as the bikers are being annihilated. This is truly a representation of adult scare tactics. Yet, as an historical piece, it is really interesting.</p>
