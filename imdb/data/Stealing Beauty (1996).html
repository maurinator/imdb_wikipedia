<p>For 20 years many visitors have come to the villa on an Italian hilltop owned by an English artist. Lucy, a 19-year-old American, was last there four years ago and wants to meet up again with the young Italian who kissed her and corresponded for a while. And she has brought the diary of her late mother filled with enigmatic poems that suggest Lucy was conceived on that hilltop. Lucy wants to find out if Daddy is the Italian war correspondent who wrote to her mother for 20 years. Then again Daddy could be the dying English playwright in residence or the artist who uses a chainsaw on tree trunks for his sculptures. The three, of course, have no idea that Lucy is there to solve a mystery. They, the artist's wife, daughter of that wife and the daughter's American lover are most intrigued by Lucy's virginity.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first twenty minutes of this movie had me riveted.  The Italian landscape was incredible and upon meeting all the diverse characters, one would think this was the perfect stage for a fine film.But it wasn't.Lucy's search for her father is first pushed on the back burner then brought miraculously to life near the end of the movie.  Meanwhile the plot involves the entire house buzzing like old maids about the poor girl's virginity, as if the topic were front page news.  But then again Jeremy Irons character said it best: "Up here on this hill, the only thing we have to talk about is each other". Hm, maybe so, but the idea quickly becomes dull.Instead of becoming interested in Lucy, the only scenes I found enjoyable involved Miranda and her dim-witted "boyfriend".  Richard made me laugh so much that I nearly forgave the pointless plot.  And I would've been very disappointed were it not for Jeremy Irons and his wonderful character of Alex.  Alex's musing, thoughts and expressions made me smile and made me think. (" 'The incredible frivolity of the dying' You have to allow me a little frivolity")As far as what Lucy sees in Nicholo or what made her take the plunge with someone she barely knew, baffles me.  Take the beautiful cinemetography, interesting characters and mold them in an entirely different way and you've got yourself a much better movie than what was presented.  Such potential..wasted *sigh*</p>
