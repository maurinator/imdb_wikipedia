<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When childhood friends Al, Dennis and Eliot get together for Ray's wedding, which may or may not happen, they end up on a roller-coaster ride through reality. During one tumultuous, crazy weekend, they face adulthood and each other with new found maturity and discover what Queens Logic is all about. This comedy takes a look at friendship, loyalty, and love.</p>
<p>An ensemble of friends gather in Queens, their old stomping grounds, for the wedding of Ray and Patricia, an artist and a beautician. Al and Eliot sell fish, one is married and chases women, the other is gay and lonely. Dennis, a failing musician, comes back from L.A.; Vinnie, an actor, comes over from Manhattan; Monte drifts in. Can Ray get past feeling superior to the down to earth Patricia? Will Al's wife Carla convince him to stop philandering? What is it about Queens that inhabits these characters, including a gay man living in a homophobic neighborhood? Can guys this old still come of age? Answers come out during the rooftop bachelor party.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The only non famous movie on my top 25 list is Queens logic. I dont know why I relate to this movie. Its got a little of everything I like in a movie- comedy, male bonding or whatever you call it, good music, romance, fighting, pain, and a host of other things.  Not to mention the incredible cast.</p>
