<p>This movie is based on Somerset Maugham's novel... about how sensitive Phillip is all his life because of his club foot... He feels doomed, always to fail, in life and in love. He fights back tears and emotions daily. He takes constant abuse as a child, and becomes isolated and lonely...this carries through to adulthood and harbors in his love of Mildred. This shows one of the dark sides of love, how much abuse we can take, and still go back for more.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not-bad third version of W. Somerset Maugham's depressing story about a sluttish waitress in London and the sensitive future doctor who becomes obsessed with her. Ravaged by critics upon its release (and thought bannable for a time for Kim Novak's suggestive scenes), this remake isn't a classic, nor does it improve on the Bette Davis version, but it does have something. Novak is just fine; Laurence Harvey also good as the smitten medico. The biggest problem is the screenplay's faithfulness to Maugham's plot, which by 1964 standards was pretty creaky. Why couldn't they have updated it just a bit? For all the talk about this version being "too shocking", the movie disappoints by not shocking at all, by playing it too safe. A soap opera, to be sure, though a handsome and interesting one. Novak-diehards will love the film, and her. **1/2 from ****</p>
