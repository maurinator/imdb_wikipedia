<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I always find it strange that people think a comedy should have you rolling in your chairÂ… not so! There are movies that one gets a warm, funny feeling inside and that one appreciates the subtleties of the acting and set ups. Often a laugh a minute movie is forgotten quickly, but those movies that simmer and let the humor seep out slowly often linger in the mind.The Party is a movie shot in the sixties with all the hang-ups and social undertones that were abundant then. I laughed myself silly then and today I still laugh with the benefit of hindsight and years of social and cultural change.Peter Sellers' performance is on a level par with Chaplin; a rare achievement for any actor.</p>
