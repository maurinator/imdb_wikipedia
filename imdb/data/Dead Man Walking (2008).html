<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Confession time. Up until now, "Torchwood" has been something of a guilty pleasure. While I enjoy the show, I've never been fully satisfied. That is, until I watched "Dead Man Walking".This latest episode delivers what I always expected from the series - grown-up, adult chills and gripping drama. "Dead Man" manages to create an atmosphere of genuine menace as well as tying in the more successful themes of the first series, including the dreaded "Resurrection Glove".This is a solid achievement from the "Torchwood" production team and I can't wait to see what else they have lined up for the viewer. The latest plot arc is riveting television, helped by the appearance of one Martha Jones. 10 out of 10. The best episode since Season One's "Captain Jack Harkness".</p>
