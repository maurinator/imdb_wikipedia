<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's mighty hard to find movies that aren't about White males. But it's even harder to find a movie that's about women than one that's about brown folks. This is a quirky, tough, tender movie about women-- their lives and confusions. An earlier commenter felt that Kirstie Alley's performance was inadequate, but my husband and I were surprised how good and understated she was. It's always great to see Kathy Najimy, and Amy Brenneman was excellent.A beautifully written movie about folks.</p>
