<h1>Superman (2004)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The parody/reenactment of Superman: The Movie, the Christopher Reeve version with cartoon bunnies playing the parts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the many spoofs of Hollywood films delivered in thirty seconds and featuring bunny rabbits standing in for the actors in the more famous versions. Superman the Movie features the usual basic but amusing animation and has the required breakneck speed delivery. The awareness of the original film is good as this short picks out key scenes and dialogue to summarise the film. In doing so it has energy and pace and will amuse those familiar with the film.Of course this is not to say that the short is hilarious because sadly it is not. By directly aping the film it doesn't leave a lot of room for imagination or individual wit. Sure, the delivery is humorous but it is not actually that funny once you get the joke (ie the fact that it is Superman being re-enacted by small rabbits). The voices are squeaky but a small turn from Bryan Singer adds some extra value by his presence alone. Probably amusing enough to do for 30 seconds because, after that, the novelty does rather wear off.</p>
