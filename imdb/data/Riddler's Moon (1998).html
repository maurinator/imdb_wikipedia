<h1>Riddler's Moon (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Indiana single mother and her wheelchair bound son live on a farm that has not produced crops for years. Suddenly the land becomes fertile and blossoms, but so do the neighbors imaginations. In fact, the reason for the sudden growth turns out to be extra-terrestrial.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I would just like to say BRAVO to the creators of this movie.  Not only is the plot good, but the little bits are accurate.  The son as Spina Bifida, as I do.  Everything mentioned about him is correct, down to things like his foot rests on his chair being in the usual positions and not evenly lined up.  If only more shows like this would be produced, maybe there would be a better understanding of disabilities.</p>
