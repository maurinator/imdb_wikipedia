<h1>Nell (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nell is a girl who's been brought up in an isolated world. The only people she knew were her mother and twin sister. They lived together in a cottage in the forest. Nobody has ever met Nell. After her mother's death, she's discovered by the local doctor Jerome. He's fascinated by her, since she speaks a mangled language, developed by her sister and herself growing up, "twin speak" if you will. But Paula, a psychology student, wants her observed in a laboratory. The judge decides they get three months to observe her in the forest, after which he'll decide about Nell's future.</p>
<p>Nell is raised in the remote backwoods of North Carolina with her mother, never having met anyone else. When her mother finally dies, Nell must confront the outside world. Due to her isolation Nell never learned proper English, only a mangled form. Nice country doctor Jerome Lovell wants to help Nell adjust in her own protected surroundings, while psychology student Paula Olsen and her heartless boss Alexander Paley want to study this rare 'wild child' in their laboratory. But how long can Nell's world remain isolated?</p>
<p>In a remote woodland cabin, a small town doctor discovers Nell - a beautiful young hermit woman with many secrets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was a great and simple story. Simply about a woman raised in the wild, unable to speak proper english due to her mothers stroke and she is trying to be brought into "civilisation".Neeson and Foster are the stars of this film!! Not just because of their star status but they really showed talent in this film. Foster is brilliant as the vulnerable but independent Nell and Neeson is great as her "guardian angel". This film has its funny bits but the ending... well if youre dead sensitive, get the tissues out. When Nell speaks in the courts, I was causing a flood!!!!I give it a 10/10. Definetly one to keep forever. Helen xxxxx</p>
