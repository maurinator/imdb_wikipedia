<h1>Gertrud (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the elegant world of artists and musicians, Gertrud ends her marriage to Gustav and takes a lover, the composer Erland Jansson. When he also fails to live up to her idealistic standards, she leaves him and imposes on herself a kind of exile of the heart. In flashbacks and in conversations laced with memories, we also learn of her affair with Gabriel, who still wishes she would go off with him, and we learn of her adolescence, with its early expression of her isolating ideal of absolute love.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was completely shocked when I first saw this masterpiece, and I still get shocked every time I see it again.Dreyer's long and austere takes will not, of course, be liked by many, easy-goers, because he achieved by them to tell the unspeakable, he reached true Art. But to appreciate this means to have previously developed and refined one's taste, a tough effort which unfortunately not everybody is willing to make. And I say unfortunately because when eventually getting to understand Dreyer's idiom you'll find out that what it can tell you is much greater and soul-satisfying that anything you can get via other more readily-understandable ways.</p>
