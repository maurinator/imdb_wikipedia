<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A baby lamb named Chirin is living an idyllic life on a farm with many other sheep. Chirin is very adventurous and tends to get lost, so he wears a bell around his neck so that his mother can always find him. His mother warns Chirin that he must never venture beyond the fence surrounding the farm, because a huge black wolf lives in the mountains and loves to eat sheep. Chirin is too young and naive to take the advice to heart, until one night the wolf enters the barn and is prepared to kill Chirin, but at the last moment the lamb's mother throws herself in the way and is killed instead. The wolf leaves, and Chirin is horrified to see his mother's body. Unable to understand why his mother was killed, he becomes very angry and swears that he will go into the mountains and kill the wolf.</p>
<p>An innocent lamb learns about life and death when he seeks revenge upon the wolf who slaughtered his mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is simply amazing! I can't even begin to describe the many emotions you feel while watching it.Every time I watch this I never feel like I am watching an animated movie. This film is so powerful and gripping! The movie is about a young lamb who's mother is killed by a wolf. Chirin is devastated and goes out seeking the wolf; hell bent on getting revenge.This film is dark and may not be for everyone. I must say that this is one of my favorite films and it is very touching while being sad at the same time.Supposedly this film was made based to be a cautionary tale about Japanese children being sent off to war and never coming back. Thus the mother sheep telling Chirin never to leave beyond the farm gate. Leaving the farm only meant death.</p>
