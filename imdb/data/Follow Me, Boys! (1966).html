<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Follow Me, Boys! is a feel good film with an impressive cast.  It's a snapshot of a time when there was a true sense of community that we rarely see today.  A time when personal values carried more weight than profits.The film delivers a powerful message of just how much difference a single person can make by leading through example.  I think with today's media glut of flashy superstardom and wealth and narcissism, many us have lost sight of how much force there is in simply being a kind and honest person.  I certainly walked away re-evaluating some of my motivations and behaviors. Just how do I affect the people around me on a daily basis?</p>
