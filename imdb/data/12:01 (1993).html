<h1>12:01 (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Barry Thomas is the average office worker. He becomes attracted to Lisa Fredericks who works in the same company. After work, Barry witnesses the murder of Lisa and goes to a bar to get drunk. Later that night, there is a storm and Barry gets a shock from a lamp's faulty power wire at exactly 12:01 am. The next morning, he realizes that everything is happening exactly as it did the previous day. The next morning the day is repeated again. It is now Barry's job--being the only person alive who is aware of this time loop--to stop the murder of Lisa, and stop the time loop or be caught in time forever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent film - better than groundhog day and other similar time loop stories. Well acted and easy to follow. Sometimes the TV films are the best ones as they don't have to pander to the masses. The writer managed to get inside the heads of the two main characters illustrating their good points and flaws, and showing how both changed in the process. Also lives out people's aspirations of trying to get things right given a 2nd or 3rd or 4th chance. Whereas films like The Butterfly Effect and Groundhog Day are very watchable, it seems much easier to identify with the more realistic characters in 1201. The time loops seem to be just right in length - their variability keeps the watcher interested. The ending was excellent and although predictable - it rounded off the story nicely.</p>
