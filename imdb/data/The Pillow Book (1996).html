<h1>The Pillow Book (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As a young girl in Japan, Nagiko's father paints characters on her face, and her aunt reads to her from "The Pillow Book", the diary of a 10th-century lady-in-waiting. Nagiko grows up, obsessed with books, papers, and writing on bodies, and her sexual odyssey (and the creation of her own Pillow Book) is a "parfait m√©lange" of classical Japanese, modern Chinese, and Western film images.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Erotic, seductive, intellectual, visually stunning film. The painted calligraphy on skin was amazingly sensuous. I couldn't force myself to watch '8 1/2 Women' which was my first Greenway film, so I hoped against my better judgment that this movie would be different -- and it was. I've read reviews that say this movie moves slow, but I didn't feel that at all. I think the character introspection is very important - I felt I knew Nagito. I understood her desire, her confusion and her pain. The ending is beautifully done Nagito is the perfect tragic heroine. This is a must see for anyonelooking for a sensual erotic film; unlike most you have seen before.</p>
