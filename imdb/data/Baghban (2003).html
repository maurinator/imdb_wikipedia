<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes the film was an aesthetic success. I just loved the wonderful chemistry between Hemaji and Amitji. Hemaji looked better than any of her previous films I have seen. It is not just the beauty. It is that she lived that life for the span of this shooting, I felt. If everything is the same but without Hemaji in the film, I'm not sure of the product.I wondering if the creators gave credit to the Telugu film makers anywhere in the credits, because I have not seen it. If they did not, FYI, this is lifted from a Telugu movie; completely, including the phone (there was a cute song -- by then baby Sridevi, that we all Telugu people adored); I wish the producers and director acknowledged the fact that this is remake of NTR and Anjali Devi film, Badi Pantulu (1972). Even the role played by Salman is not a new idea.This is like the lifting Khilona, Kora Kagaj or many others in the past, as well. I thought, I just mention that.However, I must tell you, the Hindi remake is made in a grandiose scale. Awesome!</p>
