<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the great films of the war, "Mrs. Miniver" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1942.  In 1950, M-G-M released this sequel; "The Miniver Story." A disappointment if there ever was one!  First of all, the first film was directed by the legendary director, William Wyler.  This film was directed by H. C. Potter.  No more needed to be said on that point!  And since this is a sequel, why is there no mention of the Miniver's older son Vincent? (Played by Richard Ney in the first film.) It's as if he never existed. Both Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon (the only originals) should have said no to this turkey!</p>
