<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>(No spoilers herein).My friend sent me this movie wanting to know my comments on it, without telling me even a word of what it was about or what he thought of it.  I went and checked out the entry on IMDB and was a touch confused why he was sending me a sort of musical half-western flick, being that neither of those categories would pop up at the top of either our lists.Needless to say, something about this movie surprised me -- I fully enjoyed watching it !  Right from the start the characters were interesting and the scenes quite absurdly funny.  Some of the singing was truly awful (in a funny way), and other songs were actually very toe-tappingly catchy.There is a whole lot of physical humor in this movie, from the opening scene after they bury the guy, to the ending scenes with the bull.  And holy crap the older man drinks a lot.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a single character drinks so much hard alcohol !  Along with the numerous sexual jokes I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie for children.As the movie came to a conclusion, I found myself attached to the main characters and wanting to see more of their adventures.  The plot had a very natural progression.  As silly and ridiculous as it certainly was, the plot made a strange sort of sense.I rate the movie an 8 out of 10.</p>
