<h1>The Devil's Hairpin (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cocky car racer Nick Jargin has retired since he nearly caused the death of his brother at a hairpin bend on a circuit. He now holds a trendy caf√© who keeps him busy full time until one day, Tony Boari, a new champion racer, challenges him. Nick returns to competition and this time around he will have not only to beat his new rival but also his own demons. Kelly, her pretty lover, and Mrs. Jargin, his no-nonsense mother will help him to.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a story of an ex-racing driver, played by Cornel Wilde, who is not a very likeable person.  As the story develops and this driver must run a final race, I found myself cheering for him to win. The final racing scenes makeup for an otherwise uneventful movie.   Cornel Wilde did a very good job in the lead role.  I would purchase this movie if it were available.</p>
