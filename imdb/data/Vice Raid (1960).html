<h1>Vice Raid (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The bosses of the prostitution racket have one of their prostitutes go to New York City to entrap a police officer and get him thrown off the force. She does as she is told but then the gangsters make a mistake.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is interesting from a historical viewpoint. Obviously this movie was made to appeal as much as possible to prurient interests, while disingenuously throwing a skimpy veil of morality over it, so that people (meaning men, like me) way back when had some sort of flimsy excuse for our viewing (leering?) pleasure. Today, given that we no longer seem to need to bother with any excuses (in entertainment, at least), this movie is pretty pointless, but many guys might still find it fun and titillating to see what people used to consider "daring" and "risque". Women probably won't be very impressed by either this movie or you for watching it. The plot is thinner than the flat screen you're going to watch it on, while the women are pleasantly thick. It's really short. It's not even close to Shakespeare. Your choice.</p>
