<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A unique Western intercut with modern day, with the unique trait of having a cast largely composed of actors with down syndrome and other disabilities. The film was made by the Zeno Film Camp, and all proceeds go toward a feature they want to make in this same unique genre. Our protagonist Benny Jackson will do anything to keep his family business from being closed down by a filthy rich developer and town bully. He must find the deed to his family's saloon, but in in search, he comes across something more valuable. The journal of Bulletproof Jackson, which tells a fantastic story of how Benny's ancestor Bulletproof Jackson managed to save the day many years ago. The past and present stories parallel one another as Benny learns from the past. It's a fantastic classic story with fantastic production quality. The film is incredibly well done without taking itself too seriously. We instantly love our protagonists, Benny and Bulletproof Jackson. We want them to succeed. It's pretty long for a short and probably didn't need to be too long, but I was never bored. Every character is so much fun, and the Western scenes look great. Very impressive work, can't wait to see the feature they come up with!</p>
