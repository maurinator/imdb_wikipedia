<h1>Great Expectations (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Meg gets two Cs on her report card and Helen, more concerned about it than Jack is, thinks it would be a good idea for Meg to accompany her to her Temple class. Meg dislikes the idea, but not as much as she dislikes the fact that Luke agrees with her mother. Roxanne is also at odds with her mother, so she stays with the Pryors. Meanwhile, Beth notices J.J. talking to Colleen and Jack hires Henry's nephew, Nathan; and it seems that there's a bullying problem in Will's third-grade class.</p>
