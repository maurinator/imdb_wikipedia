<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>KITH's full feature film!!  It's our five favorite clearly insane guys from up north.  What else can you ask for?First, the story does NOT have your typical happy bears skipping, nutty bunnies frolicking kind of ending.  The concept of pharmaceutical drugs being able to make life a better place is very thought provoking.  Think about how we rely on drugs to treat colds, headaches...of course, we can discuss society's views on 'other' drugs, but that's a different monologue onto itself!!Anyhoo, the origin of the drug's name is hilarious!!  I have to admit, the Kids really spoof the corporate world well.  Bruce and Mark really play their eccentric characters to a "T". RED SOCKS, repeat, RED SOCKS!!  Although limited, Dave does a great job playing the straight man ("I don't understand German").  Kev is his manic awesome self and Scott's best role is probably that of closet case Wally.I haven't even touched upon Grivo, the cabbie or any of the other characters in the film.  Don't forget about Bellini!  PLUS cameos too!  KUDOS to the guys for not caving in and taking out C.B. (for those who haven't seen it, I don't want to spoil it) from the film due to pressure from the P.C. laden bigwig movie execs.  I also enjoyed the moral (twisted though it is true) of the movie and there is a lot of subtle humor...just a tad darker than their TV series.The last time i saw this was probably 1996.  Watching it again on DVD makes me really appreciate (and miss) the guys' film.  Sure, it may not have done great in the box office or achieved the big bucks.  Usually, I tend to avoid mainstream blockbuster poo, so Brain Candy is definitely cult material.  But then again, aren't Kids in the Hall?*Sadly, the DVD is bare bones with the movie in widescreen format, chapter search and audio/subtitle.  It's really great to just have this gem in my collection.  Hey, I recently heard that KITH were discussing doing another feature film.Hmmm....</p>
