<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was so disappointed when I put this disc into my machine. The dialogue is dubbed in Standard Scots!! Even though in many cases it's the original actors supplying the dialogue, it still sounds very strange. Native Scots will find this difficult to watch due the strange accents. Accents that sound very unnatural. Accents that are neither Kelvinside nor Morningside. I have not made it to the end of this DVD because the dubbed soundtrack is so annoying and off putting.The distributor missed a trick with this release. The American DVD release of Gregory's Girl has two soundtracks Â– English and Scottish. They could have done the same with A Sense of Freedom.Let's hope that STV release this drama in its original form.</p>
