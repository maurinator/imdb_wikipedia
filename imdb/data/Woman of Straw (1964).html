<h1>Woman of Straw (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A ruthless tycoon, whom his nephew (Anthony "Tony" Richmond) hates as he had both deprived his father of half of the family business and had (after his father had committed suicide) married his mother. A nurse (Maria) from a poor Italian family, is initially hired to care for the tycoon. She initially dislikes him because he abuses his employees. Tony convinces Maria to persist in his employ, however, telling her that he plans to bequeath his entire (50 million pound) fortune to charity. He plans to help her marry him, then to help him change his will, and (perhaps) then to help her achieve her inheritance...all for a payoff of 1 million pounds.</p>
<p>Tyrannical but ailing tycoon Charles Richmond becomes very fond of his attractive Italian nurse, Maria. The nurse, in turn, falls in love with Charles' ne'er-do-well nephew Anthony, who plots ways to gain control of his uncle's fortune.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Trying to find this film on video or DVD is beyond impossible.  It's currently playing on FLIX (August/2002), and is certainly worth a look.  Sir Sean Connery did a wonderful job of taking the cool sophistication that made his interpretation of James Bond the watermark for all others and turning it sideways, making Anthony Richmond a nephew you do *not* want to invite to the family reunion.</p>
