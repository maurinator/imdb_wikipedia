<h1>Murder Most Foul (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Although the evidence appears to be overwhelming in the strangulation murder of a blackmailer, Miss Marple's sole 'not guilty' vote hangs the jury 11-1. She becomes convinced that the real murderer is a member of a local theatrical troupe, so she joins them in order to gather information. The clues lead back many years to a single disastrously unsuccessful 1951 performance of a dreadful play written by the group's hammy director, H. Driffold Cosgood. Although at that time, several of the current cast members were only children, more murders follow before Miss Marple ultimately exposes the killer.</p>
<p>After being the only holdout in a jury that was ready to convict a man of killings his fellow lodger, Mrs. McGuinty, Miss Marple sets out to find the real killer. She finds that the dead woman had a particular interest in a theater company, the Cosgood Players, run by H. Driffold Cosgood. She no sooner manages to get an unpaid position with the company than one of the actors, George Rowton, is poisoned and dies minutes before a performance. Miss Marple is certain that it's the same person responsible for both murders and when another member of the company is killed, Miss Marple is convinced that it she who was the intended victim.</p>
<p>During the trial of the prime suspect of the murder of Mrs. McGinty, Miss Jane Marple is the only member of the jury that believes that the accused is innocent. The judge schedules another trial and Miss Marple invites her friend Jim Stringer to go to the house of the victim to talk with her sister and snoop around. Miss Marple discovers that Mrs. McGinty was an actress and she joins the theatrical company of H. Driffold Cosgood to investigate and find the real killer. But soon people around her dies and Inspector Craddock and Mr. Stringer are worried about her safety.</p>
<p>When Miss Marple joins a theatrical company after a blackmailer is murdered, several members of the troupe are also dispatched by this mysterious killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jane Marple joins a rather interesting acting troupe in order to find out the real killer of Mrs. McGinty, a woman hanged in her apartment.  Marple initially is a member of a jury judging the case of a man who she believes was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Once a part of the acting company, murder follows and Jane's life becomes in great peril.  Margaret Rutherford once again dons the role of super-sleuth Jane Marple.  She looks like she is having so much fun with the role as she rolls her eyes, makes suggestive facial expressions, and furls her capes.  She truly is a joy to watch as she waltzes her way through this rather tame, uninspired material.  But what the story lacks in creativity, she adds with her screen persona.  Her recitation of the Robert Service poem "The Killing of Dan McGrew" is worth a look at the film alone.  Stringer Davis, as her librarian friend(and real-life husband) and Charles Tingwell, as Inspector Craddock, are back once again to aid Miss Marple(not that she really needs their help).  Both actors are fun to watch as they interact with the grand dame.  Ron Moody plays the head of the acting troupe.  He is as ever very eccentric and plays nicely off Rutherford as well.  It's a pity this was the last of the Marple/Rutherford films.  They are so much fun to watch!</p>
