<h1>No Trains No Planes (1999)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Seen as a sneak preview, I was pleasantly surprised by this treat. The movie takes the viewers along a day's life in an ordinary dutch cafe, with the life of the failed Gerard as the red line. The individualism of the 90's is cynically but very well depicted in some typical dutch characters.</p>
