<h1>The Little Engine That Could (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A little switch engine named Tillie must help the birthday train reach a town that holds a kid's upcoming birthday party. Unfortunetly, it is past by a treacherous mountain.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a father of a young boy who loved trains as a toddler, I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie to other adults with children who may happen to find themselves in similar positions; read the readily available picture book before, after or - even! - during viewing this video: 'I think I can ... I think I can ... I think I can ...' is a GREAT message to embed in young minds, ain't it? The story is about a small, blue engine asked to take over from older, more experienced engines who have somehow failed to function on a journey carrying an exceptionally important cargo: TOYS! - to the children on the other side of the mountain. Who could resist, eh?</p>
