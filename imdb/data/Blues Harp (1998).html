<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chuuji is half black, has a homeless father and he works in a bar. He has connections deep into the yakuza which he cares little about. He saves a girl with whom he get together with.Ikeuchi Hiroyuki is very good as Chuuji, the protagonist that you care about in this movie. The story is a sad one with little sentimentality and told with joy so we don't get turned off it.Miike is a promising filmmaker, but maybe he should spend some more time on each movie instead of spewing 'em out. 'Chuugoku no Chounin' suffers a little from this. Such is the case also with this movie. Its still recommended for the lead act.</p>
