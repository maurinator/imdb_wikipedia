<h1>The Return of the Sister Street Fighter (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the crime boss has to pick one of his thugs for a fight he takes his knife, throws it to the roof and kills a butterfly with it, then the knife falls to one guy's shoulder and that's the man he's chosen for the job. That's some serious inventiveness. And who's the guys he's gonna fight? That's Yasuaki Kurata of course.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If your cup of tea is martial arts action, then this film is for you. It has lots of action, female nudity, more fighting, some ridiculous Japanese character in black-face, fighting on the rooftops, drugs, burning houses, more nudity, more fights; it just goes on and on.Somehow there is a point to all of this, but it just seems like Sister Street Fighter's Greatest Hits. A thin story about using chemicals to smuggle gold and a friend forced to be the mistress of the kingpin is just an excuse to have fights. Many of the fights are pretty lame, with the loser going down quickly. But, hey, it's great 70s grind-house fun and the hokeyness is just part of that.</p>
