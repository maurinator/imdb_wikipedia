<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This symbol-filled story, filmed with sensuous detail and nuance, is set in Austria in the 1920s. While being treated for asthma at a country spa, an American diplomat's lonely 12-year-old son is befriended and infatuated by a suave, mysterious baron. During a story of his war experiences, the baron reveals the scar of a wound from an American soldier and thrusts a pin through it, saying "see-- no feeling." Little does the boy realize that it is his turn to be wounded. But soon his adored friend heartlessly brushes him aside and turns his seductive attentions to his mother. The boy's jealousy and feelings of betrayal become uncontrollable.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A superb script is perhaps the best reason to see this movie, but it's a splendid film on all counts. I saw it during its original theatrical release and once since then, but it's the kind of movie that sticks in the memory.Brandauer gives his usual splendid performance. The man has never given a bad one as far as I know, and this is one of his best. The camera loves him and you can read this character's thoughts from his eyes alone. The sometimes uneven Dunaway is just wonderful here, and still very beautiful when this was made. David Eberts, as her son, is also very fine and believable. The atmosphere created by this movie will haunt you. Yes, I suppose it is an "art film," whatever that means. There are no car chases and the themes are very adult and provocative in the best sense. Photography and settings are beautiful. Give this a look, it will stick with you.</p>
