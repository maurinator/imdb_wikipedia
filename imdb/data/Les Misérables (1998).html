<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>They could not have chosen a better cast!  Uma Thurman is extremely talented; very convincing as a selfless mother who will do anything to make sure her child is taken care of.  Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush: they make this movie so intense, it reaches in and grabs your heart; joy, sorrow, fear, anger, pity, every emotion necessary for such a timeless classic.</p>
