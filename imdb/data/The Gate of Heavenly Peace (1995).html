<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I give ten stars not for the documentary or its biased views, but for China's fantastic ability to maintain order. Surprised?"Tian'anmen Square Protest", or as I'd like to call it, "Carnival of the Moron Students". A lot of my classmates know about this as well, despite the government's attempts to block this incident, and they all agree that the entire incident was student-stupid and pointless. But frankly I don't see the need to block this from public knowledge - I admit, I was a bit shocked at first when I learned this happen, but after calming down and looking at it from all perspectives I find that this isn't something to be ashamed of, but something to admit with ultimate pride. Which other country has ever done this far to maintain order? Germany? France? Russia? Japan? Canada? United States? From its founding thousands of years ago everything about China has been order. Assassin's Creed put China in Templar category - that's good, because China was all about order, and order - not freedom - is the basic foundation of a country's - even Humanity's - survival. We talk about freedom, but deep down we all want(even when we don't want to admit it) order to supercede freedom. We tidy our room; order, not freedom. We stop on red lights and go on green; order, not freedom. We follow protocols and laws and regulations in daily life... all order, not freedom. Granted, assault rifles w/ expanding bullets was a little extreme, but conveniently they left out the parts that the rioters also charged in and brutally beaten and burned the PLA members after dousing them with gasoline, the parts where they create chaos in the country, and how foreign influences and indoctrinations fueled this stupid fire. The causing of June 4 differs from the protests on May 4 - May 4 was during the country's Protocol One(near-death) and the total obliteration of the Chinese culture was imminent, In that instance the protest was justified. June 4 was more chaos-bringing than justified protests; bunch of idiotic students gathering together disrupting order. It needs to - and has to - be maintained at all costs, and even the tiniest disruption of that should be put down hard, let alone an event that chaotic. Those students believed the PLA wouldn't open live fire on them... why would they? They ride those soldiers like they were racehorses - tools, not people; PLA gave the students half an inch and they walk all over them, why the hell would they believe? If they did they wouldn't have wreaked havoc on those soldiers who assisted in building the country that it is today.Knowing the truth gave me great satisfaction. Seeing the dead bloody students there... man, that feels good. The only good chaos-bringer is a dead one(if I was one of those jerks bringing chaos I very much deserve to be shot. Glad I'm not), and frankly I'm not sorry they were. Sacrificing a few hundred to ensure the order of more than a billion? Even cleaning out the entire capital population would be a bargain trade I'd make in a heartbeat. And I'm suppressing my anger hard trying not to act on my impulse and rip those interviewed survivors' faces clean off.Saw China was condemned for this. And the Dharma Wheel. And liberating Tib-- Xizang(they don't deserve the unique name!) and Xinjiang provinces. So what? China condemn suicide bombings and terrorism as well. The only difference between these condemnations? China condemns those who DISRUPT order, while a lot western countries condemn those who MAINTAIN them. Those students dead? Let them die. They deserve fate far worse than this for disrupting order. They want immolation? Starvation? Friggin' suit themselves. I just feel the Chinese government back then - even with Deng at the helm - was weak-- there, I said it: WEAK. Think the government was evil? They weren't even close to that - wish they were. They should have used artillery, grenades and satchel charges on them - much more effective. Tank man? They should have rolled his stupid body straight over or at least use their main cannon. And also, should there be another protest in the future I'm all in for another crackdown like this - only harder. Talking Chinese Communist Party was fascism? Maybe that's exactly what China is lacking. All this talk about humanism severely dulled the once sharp and fierce blade of the Chinese laws and regulations, and now corruption in China only receives postponed death penalty, which pretty much means none at all. How pathetic is that?Praise China for its ability to make the hardest decision to maintain order. Condemnation to those moron students, and may their wretched souls never find peace, ever!</p>
