<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this movie was very interesting and very profound. I'm willing to bet money that if Angelina Jolie was not in it, the majority of the viewers would not have seen it. I thought this movie was great, not because of our favorite "Tomb Raider" hero, but because, the message that this movie sends. I believe it really hits home for the audience. If you are interested in action, romance, and adventure, then I recommend this movie. Jolie plays a great part in this film. Her character is so passionate and just so full of adventure. I think this film is one of Angelina's bests--not THE best--but, one. So, once again, if you have not seen it, then please, try and make time for it.</p>
