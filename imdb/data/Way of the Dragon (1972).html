<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the best Bruce Lee movie, period.  The single reason is that this movie shows him off a lot more than the other ones.In this film, the one and only Bruce Lee made his directing debut.  Not only the movie showed the world why he is the greatest martial artist to ever live, it showed that he is way ahead of his time.  This film showcased his astounding skills, agility, and charm much more so than the brilliant classic "Enter the Dragon", and this film will show how truly fast and nimble Bruce Lee is with his fists and feet (the people had to accelerate the frame rates of all his films in order to catch his movements properly). The fight scenes are unbelievable, and it is already widely regarded that the final Colloseum battle between Tang Long (Bruce Lee) and Colt (Chuck Norris) is the best fighting sequence ever filmed for a movie.Do yourself a favor by watching the original Way of the Dragon with all it's original fighting noises intact.  Those who are content on only watching the English-dubbed version are missing out on a lot!!!!  Any true fans of Bruce Lee can attest the massive difference it makes in experiencing the real voices of Bruce Lee when he is fighting on-screen.</p>
