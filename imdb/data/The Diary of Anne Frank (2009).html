<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>''The Diary of Anne'' (2009) is an accurate adaption of Anne Frank's diary. It's a very nice movie. I am very much interested about Anne Frank and I've seen six movies about Anne Frank. The 2009 adaption of Anne's diary is a fine one. Although it is not as excellent as ''Anne Frank: The Whole Story'' (2001), it is a very moving miniseries and can give the audience a clear idea about Anne Frank. The casting was excellent. Ellie Kendrick- I have no words to describe her- gave an amazing performance as Anne Frank. Really, Ellie is a talented young actress. I'd also like to praise the performances of Felicity Jones who played Margot Frank, Geoff Breton who played Peter van Daan and Tamsin Greig who played Edith Hollander Frank. And Nicholas Ferrell, who played Albert Dussel, also gave a wonderful performance. Lesley Sharp who played Petronella van Daan and Kate Ashfield who played Miep Gies also gave wonderful performances. The casting was, in short, excellent. The story was also arranged in such a way that we liked the movie very much. But I'd like to say that ''Anne Frank: The Whole Story'' and ''The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank'' were better than ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (2009), but still, the 2009 adaption was indeed a nice one and I liked it. I'd like to give the movie: 7 out of 10.</p>
