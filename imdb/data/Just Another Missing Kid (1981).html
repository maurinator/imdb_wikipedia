<h1>Just Another Missing Kid (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On July 10, 1978, Eric Wilson - a 19-year from Ottawa and student at Tufts University - left home to drive to a summer college course in Colorado. When he went missing four days afterward in Nebraska, his family tried to persuade local and U.S. police that he wasn't simply a runaway and hadn't simply forgotten to call home. The program examines the lengths to which they had to go to find out what happened to Eric, and the byzantine nature of the legal system which seemed less interested in pursuing justice than in avoiding the expenses involved in the investigation and potential trials.</p>
<p>After their son Eric disappeared during a car trip from Ottawa to Colorado, Marilyn and William Wilson expected empathy and quick action from the police. Instead, they encountered indifference, incompetence and bureaucratic red tape from both Canadian and American authorities, and they eventually had to turn to a private investigator for answers. Using interviews and reenactments, this documentary reveals the excruciating difficulties the Wilsons faced in discovering the fate of their son.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the best documentary I've ever seen. It is forgotten and impossible to get, but I'm sure if it were available again it would be judged among our best documentaries. It tells as chilling a tale as I have seen told on film. A young boy "goes missing" during a cross-country teenage trip. It is clear that he has been killed, but the family is unable to get any information though the police. They hire a private detective who tracks down the boy's killers and reconstructs the crime. The interviews with the boy's mother and brother bring this sweet boy back to life. The chilling interviews with the killers give the detective his moment in the sun. He is brilliant, and the killers a portrayal of the banality of evil. Wonderful film. Horrible story.</p>
