<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It isn't ever going to be considered an Oscar caliber classic, but it is a very well written, directed, and performed movie. Almost all the lines are referenced to each other at one point or another. The soundtrack is phenomenal. Even the extras (with the possible exception to the guard shack guy) are even good and believable. The movie captures all the nervousness and awkwardness of that first date with a woman you are trying hard to impress. If you have a date and don't know what to see, take a chance with this (rental or go all out and buy it if you can find it). I don't think anyone going in with an open mind will be disappointed. PLEASE STICK WITH IT THROUGH THE FIRST 15 MINUTES. It does pick up. The only (if it has one) downfall of this movie is that it starts slow but you have to pay attention from the opening credits to after the credits. Worth your time and money.</p>
