<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a solid and interesting drama  that also makes some thoughtful social commentary on issues such as power, corruption, greed, racism, torture and the ability of the powerful to influence the masses  but also on the fact there were a few people who tried to stand up for justice and fairness  but their success was short-lived and sadly there were tragic consequences as a result.While the script lacks subtlety and sophistication, it is nevertheless pacy and interesting, albeit the Mafia connections seem to be underplayed. The acting performances are good all-round, the best and most interesting being from Christopher Walken, Bruce Davidson, but above all Joaquim de Almeida in a powerhouse performance as a self-made Italian businessman . Alassandro Colla is pretty good as the lead character, but not on the level of the first three actors, and this was his only piece of work in Hollywood. The film captures the time very well, so credit has to go to production designer David Chapman for creating a good feel of 1890s New Orleans. Nicholas Meyer's directing is more polished here  certainly better than some of his feature film outings. He seems so much better suited to character dramas as a genre than more action packed material. He handles the courtroom scenes well and the film's more action oriented climax is slickly handled. Certainly Ron Roose's editing is much more competent than his and Meyer's previous collaboration on Star Trek VI. John Altman's score is appropriate bittersweet on a story that is a tragedy. In summary, a TV film that is definitely worth watching, and while literal and on-the-nose it still gives you plenty to think about.</p>
