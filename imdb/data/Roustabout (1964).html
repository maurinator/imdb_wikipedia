<h1>Roustabout (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Charlie Rogers is a leather-jacketed biker who's fired from a singing engagement after getting into a fight with a group of college toughs. While riding his cycle to the next gig, an irate dad runs him off the road when he flirts with his daughter. He's forced to hook up with a traveling carnival until his bike can be fixed. The carnival is run by a tough old broad, a broken-down drunk and his nubile daughter. Along the way, Charlie (who's got a chip on his shoulder about being an orphan) somehow learns about family values from this vaguely dysfunctional one. A scheming rival carny shows up, based on the legend of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's real-life manager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of Paramount's best Elvis films.  Barbara and Elvis have great chemistry -- too bad no may-december hoochy-coochy was allowed.  The songs are pretty bizarre, but mostly pretty good by 60s Elvis standards.  I dig the carnival atmosphere.  Billy Barty pops up as........ a midget!</p>
