<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie makes my top 10 list.  This movie tells the basic story "things aren't always as they seem."  This movie shows just how hard it is to open up yourself an let someone know how much you care and also stresses how sometimes one can be blind and not see love in front of their eyes.  This is simply a great movie.</p>
