<h1>Light Sleeper (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A drug dealer with upscale clientele is having moral problems going about his daily deliveries. A reformed addict, he has never gotten over the wife that left him, and the couple that use him for deliveries worry about his mental well-being and his effectiveness at his job. Meanwhile someone is killing women in apparently drug-related incidents.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A drug runner searchers for redemption in a life that only has a past and present with no future in sight. Top performance from Willem and a clever characterisation from Saradon. The dialogue fits in perfectly while the music sets the mood right.</p>
