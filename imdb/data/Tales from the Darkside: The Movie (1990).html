<h1>Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is really three shorter movies, bound together by a fourth tale in which the other three stories are read. The first segment features an animated mummy stalking selected student victims; the second tale tells the story of a "cat from Hell" who cannot be killed and leaves a trail of victims behind it; the third story is about a man who witnesses a bizarre killing and promises never to tell what he saw, and the "in-between" bit is the story of a woman preparing to cook her newspaper boy for supper.</p>
<p>Betty prepares a dinner party for eight guests with little Timmy, caged in the kitchen, to be the main dish. Buying time whilst hoping to escape, Timmy tells three horror stories: "Lot 249" - student Lee uses his best friend Andy's sister Susan to oust nerd Bellingham and take his place at the university. In retaliation, Bellingham brings a mummy to his room and, using a scroll to revive the dead, takes revenge against Lee and Susan, and later Andy. "Cat from Hell" - millionaire Drogan hires hit-man Halston to slay a cat-from-Hell that has killed three other people who lived with him at his mansion. Halston soon learns that the cat is truly from Hell. "Lover's Vow" - washed up artist Preston goes to friend Jer's bar to meet his agent Wyatt who thereby tells him he won't be his agent anymore. Preston commiserates until Jer closes the bar. As they leave together, Jer is attacked out of the blue and decapitated by a gargoyle. Preston is spared by promising the gargoyle never to reveal what has happened or what he saw. The gargoyle flies away. As Preston scurries home, he finds a woman, Carola, nearby and invites her to his flat to call a cab. They begin a romance. Ten years later and happily married with two children, Preston decides to disclose his secret to his wife - with tragic consequences for himself and his family.</p>
<p>A young boy tells three stories of horror to distract a witch who plans to eat him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is really three shorter movies, bound together by a fourth tale in which the other three stories are read. The first segment features an animated mummy stalking selected student victims; the second tale tells the story of a "cat from hell" who cannot be killed and leaves a trail of victims behind it; the third story is about a man who witnesses a bizarre killing and promises never to tell what he saw and the "in-between" bit is the story of a woman preparing to cook her newspaper boy for supper. Not the best king adaption, but hey, it ain't bad either. A good cast and some nice special effects. The Gargoyle was nasty! Plenty of gore here, but used in just enough moderation to be effective. A couple of tense moments, some god scares (Especially in the story about involving an elusive, seemingly immortal cat.) and pretty good music. Pretty good movie, just nothing really spectacular or life-changing. My rating for "Tales from the Darkside: The Movie"--6/10.</p>
