<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this fact-based melodrama, Joe Fisk is a juvenile delinquent who falls in love with Lisa Taylor, a Catholic girl's school student, in an Oregon forest. The two meet by chance when the troubled young man stumbles upon her while being chased by his peers in a training exercise, sees the lovely young girl floating in a small lake as she works on a photography assignment. The two are immediately drawn to each other, but neither of their custodians encourage contact of the opposite sex. However, when their relationship is discovered there's trouble all around, forcing the young lovers to flee. The question then remains: Will they be able to escape the law and other authorities long enough to find happiness?</p>
<p>A young woman from a Catholic school and a young man from a nearby prison camp fall in love and must run away together to escape the law, the church and their parents.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is truly irresistible from opening to closing credits. It's one of my all-time favorites. Virginia Madsen makes a fantastic performance, and she has great chemistry with Craig Sheffer. They make one of the most charming movie couples of the '80s. (I have the poster framed over my couch, and I can't look at it without smiling.) I can certainly recommend this movie! The only thing that's wrong with "Fire With Fire" is really that it ends too soon. Every time I see the closing credits start to roll in I wish that the movie would go on for another hour. And it's also very sad how rare this movie is. I thank my lucky star that I saw the trailer on an old rental movie, otherwise I wouldn't even know that "Fire With Fire" exists. Romantic hearts around the world: see this movie! You won't be sorry.</p>
