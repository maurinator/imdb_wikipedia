<h1>Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Topper Harley is found working as an odd-job-man in a monastery. The CIA wants him to lead a rescue mission into Iraq, to rescue the last rescue team, who went in to rescue the last rescue team who... who went in to rescue hostages left behind after Desert Storm. The President is Tug Benson, who also likes to be in on the action. Basically, it's a send-up of all the big shoot-em-up Rambo/Robocop/T2/Commando-type movies.</p>
<p>Topper Harley has retired again, now living in a budhist monastery, and again he's asked to lead a special operation into Iraq, to rescue the guys who were sent to rescue the guys who were sent to rescue some prisoners left behind after the Persian Gulf War, where he will meet again with his beloved Ramada while he tries to uncover who the traitor is and kill as many Iraqis as he can.</p>
<p>"Rambo" parody in which Topper Harley leads a rescue team into Iraq to save Iraqi war prisoners and all of their previous rescue teams.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While the original will always be  considered better, this film still held true  to the Hot Shots mentality. While the  whole concept may have been a little dragged  out, at least they didn't try to make another  movie to further destroy this franchise.  Charlie Sheen was once again, Charlie  Sheen. With yet another tongue-in-cheek  performance, Sheen proves to us he is one of the  most nonchalant comedy actor of our day.  Plenty of funny things to talk about, but far too  many to mention.</p>
