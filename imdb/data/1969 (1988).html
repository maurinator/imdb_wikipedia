<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This would have been better titled "1988 with 1969 fantasies." The opportunity to re-do the sixties idealism to a new crowd was squandered here by stereotypes. It was clear the writers and/or producers got their ideas from nothing but a few library books.While the attempts to not go OTT with the fashions was honorable, they didn't go far enough. A few short dresses didn't cut it.And the older brother becoming an MIA was so predictable it was pathetic.The best thing about this flick was the soundtrack. I could listen to Cream's "White Room" all day.I kept waiting for Keifer to repeat Daddy Don's line from "Kelly's Heroes." "Give me those positive waves." Shaky at best.</p>
