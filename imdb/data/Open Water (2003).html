<h1>Open Water (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A couple on a holiday in the Caribbean decide to spend the day on a scuba diving trip. But was it the wrong decision? When a mis-count happens on the boat, Susan and Daniel are left behind in the middle of the ocean, the boat long gone. With all their hopes set on the boat coming back to rescue them, they try to keep themselves safe, especially when sharks start to appear.</p>
<p>Happy couple Daniel 'Dan' and Susan book a tropical holiday in the Caribean. They toughen out a mosquito-spoiled night after the exhausting flight, looking forward to the scuba diving next day. They enjoy it so much they're last to come up, but by then the boat has left, despite the obligatory divers count, which got upset after Seth, who forgot his mask, convinced someone to dive as regulations-required buddy with him. The current carries them away in open water, helplessly trying to attract someone's attention in vain, stung jellyfish and fearing shark attacks. Susan starts wining and absurdly blaming Dan, who feels forced to remind her that it's her's. Both are desperately exhausted by the time their disappearance gets noticed and a rescue operation by plane and boat is mounted.</p>
<p>A young thirty-something couple goes on holiday to the Caribbean. One of the fun activities available to them is scuba diving off a reef several miles out. Due to a faulty head count taken by the dive boat crew, the couple is left behind in the open ocean. They find themselves drifting endlessly for hours on end, facing dehydration, saltwater sickness, jellyfish stings, and sharks! Although a boat and a large ship pass by within the couple's view, neither sees them, and they are not discovered missing until the following morning when a member of the dive boat crew discovers their gear on the boat, and their hotel manager discovers they never returned to their room. Frantically a search is mounted by plane, boat, and helicopter, looking for the missing couple.</p>
<p>When two divers find themselves stranded in the ocean, getting rescued becomes the least of their worries when a frenzy of hungry sharks close in on them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A short and sweet gimmick movie about two people who are stranded in the middle of the ocean when their scuba diving boat leaves without them and then face the ordeal of slowly dying (of dehydration and/or exposure) or quickly dying (gobbled up by sharks).The obvious question of course is: can a director pull off a visually interesting film when the bulk of it consists of two people sitting immobile in the water? The answer is yes, mostly. The film does a good job of creating a dreadful feeling in the pit of your stomach, not because we care all that much about these particular people (the characters aren't developed enough or likable enough for that) but because the situation they find themselves in taps into any number of visceral fears that just about anyone could relate to.And kudos to the writer and director for having the guts to go for the grim, nihilistic ending.Grade: B</p>
