<h1>Jules and Jim (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Paris, before WWI, two friends, Jules (Austrian) and Jim (French) fall in love with the same woman, Catherine. But Catherine loves and marries Jules. After the war, when they meet again in Germany, Catherine starts to love Jim... This is the story of three people in love, a love which does not affect their friendship, and about how their relationship evolves with the years.</p>
<p>In the years leading up to World War I, Jules and Jim are inseparable friends. Living in Paris gives them ample opportunities to expand their horizons as they discuss politics, the arts and life in general. Jim is something of a ladies man but Jules isn't so lucky. They soon meet Catherine, a free spirit and the three of them enjoy life together. She soon agrees to marry Jules but with the arrival of the war Jules, a German, return to his home country to serve in the army. Jim serves in the French army and both survive the war. It is a happy day when the two friends are reunited but Jules admits that his marriage has been less than successful and that Catherine has taken many lovers over the years. He loves her very much however and will go to any lengths to keep her with him. Jim and Catherine soon become lovers, with Jules' tacit approval, but Catherine's own needs and desires lead to tragedy.</p>
<p>It's the early twentieth century. Jules, an introspective Austrian, and Jim, an extroverted womanizing Frenchman, form an unlikely friendship when they meet in Paris, it based on the interests and outlook they do share such as writing, although do also embrace their differences. Inexperienced Jules falls for Catherine, a beguiling young woman prone to swings in temperament. While Jules and Catherine date, Jim is openly welcomed into many of their outings, she being a confidante to both of them. Jules and Catherine eventually do marry and have a daughter, Sabine. But an attraction also develops between Jim and Catherine, of which Jules is well aware. Their combined friendship is shown through their meeting, through the Great War where the two men are fighting on opposite sides, and physical separation as Jules, Catherine and Sabine move to rural Rhineland. But each person's relationship with the other two is complicated as it is not only based on their direct feelings for the person in question, but what he/she wants in life, and what the other two want and feel, which is especially important for Jim who has a serious girlfriend named Gilberte to consider as well.</p>
<p>In 1912, in Paris, the French bon-vivant Jim meets the insecure German Jules and they begin a great friendship. When they meet the fickle and independent French Catherine, they immediately fall in love with her. However the naiveness and fragility of Jules attracts the amoral Catherine and she marries him. With the First World War, the best friends Jules and Jim are separated, but after the war they reunite in Jules's cottage in Germany. Jim stays with Jules, Catherine and their daughter Sabine, and Jules tells his friend that while he has lived with Catherine she has had affairs with several lovers. When Catherine falls in love with Jim, Jules asks him to stay with her at his house. Along the years, Jules and Jim live a triangle of love with Catherine, but never affecting their friendship and respect.</p>
<p>Decades of a love triangle concerning two friends and an impulsive woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the first movie by Truffault I've ever seen, and I have to say I'm now very intrigued in his other work..."Jules et Jim" is the story of two friends who meet a very beautiful and strange woman who turns up to be a bit unstable...It starts with how they all meet each other and end up together... I thought the beginning was pretty fast as many things happened and you just wonder if the whole movie will be like that. Also I thought I didn't care much for any character, but of course it was too quick to judge. There is also a narrator (throughout the movie) and at first you ask yourself if its really necessary...Still, when I decided to go grab a snack, I realized I was so hooked by the story that I couldn't. The characters behaved like no other I've seen and you find yourself wanting two different things: for it to end and for it never to end.The movie has it's many twists for those who like, even a laugh here and there, but if you see it as a whole is a very deep description of the relationship between the three main characters.The end is somehow beautiful, maybe because is "fair", maybe because is "real", maybe because is "surreal", you'll just have to watch and find out...Is one of those movies when after watching it you understand both sides: those who say it's overrated and those who claim it's a masterpiece... to me it was a one in a lifetime film experience</p>
