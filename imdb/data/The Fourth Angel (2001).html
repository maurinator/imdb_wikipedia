<h1>The Fourth Angel (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Economist reporter Jack Elgin, a workaholic, takes his family on a working trip to India, where he is to interview the PM. But their US airplane is hijacked in Limassol (Cyprus) by the unknown August 15 terrorist movement, which ends up in a bloodbath. Jack can save his pre-teen son Andrew, literally in his arms, but his wife and daughter are among the slaughter victims. Western governments seem unwilling to go after the fiends, even hide the identity of a high-profile fatal victim. Although now a single father, Jack uses all his contacts and snooping skill to seek the truth himself. A London-based Serbian free newspaper editor sets him on the trail of four Balkanic killers, but is murdered. Jack decides to exact revenge himself, tipped-off by Sûreté-contact Dugay. Meanwhile US embassy official Davidson and FBI Special Agent Jules Bernard play a key part in the official, MI5-lead investigation, which ends up crossing Jack's path.</p>
<p>Jack Elgin, the European editor of the Economist magazine, is flying to India with his family for a working vacation. En route, the AM Airlines (an American company) flight is hijacked, with the hijackers demanding $50 million in ransom. After the moneys are paid, the hijacking goes awry on the ground in Cyprus, where fifteen people end up dead, including some of the hijackers, Jack's wife and two teen-aged daughters, leaving him and his adolescent son Andrew among the survivors. Jack later learns that the two sole surviving hijackers, who were captured and who are part of a Serbian terrorist group called the August 15th Movement, have secretly been released without charge. An incensed Jack tries to find out who was behind their release, his only initial clue being that one passenger who he saw executed on board the plane is not listed among the casualties. One of the people with who Jack meets is CIA agent Henry Davidson, who is based at the American Embassy in London. Davidson, who officially states that not much can be done through legal channels, encourages Jack, off the record, to use his journalistic skills and contacts to find the hijackers and their backers, and if he finds them to use his own sense of justice. As Jack tracks the hijackers, the FBI assigns agent Jules Bernard to lead the case in conjunction with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist group. When a series of killings happen in London that seem associated with the terrorist group, Bernard believes that finding who is committing these murders will help solve the case. As Jack's killings and Bernard's investigation start to converge, the information they individually gather may piece together the entire picture of why the hijacking took place.</p>
<p>A man seeks justice when his wife and daughter are gunned down in a terrorist attack.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians. A journalist like the main character ought to have known that. Thirdly, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!</p>
