<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this film when it was released in the early 70's. I was in a foster home/private school in the North Carolina Mountains in Avery County. I truly loved this movie with it's very heart warmng storyline. While being part of the "mountain people", I can relate to the everyday activities and chores of the Luther family, such as, wildcrafting, the cold bitter snows, and the breath taking site of the beautiful North Carolina mountains. Here it is, over twenty years later, and I still love this movie. Now when I watch it, I find myself gettig a lump in my throat and I long so bad to be back in the mountains going to Blowing Rock, Banner Elk, Newland, Crossnore and Grandfather Mountain. Anyone who wants a heart-felt, sad story of the children and adults of the "deep hollers" of the North Carolina mountains, will truly enjoy this film. The characters are so believable, that you want to hug them, letting them know it's okay to take on a challenge that would save their love for one another and the love of their family. Where The Lilies Bloom is a film that teaches that no matter how strong, poor, educated and rich someone may be, there are others out there who have something better...and that is love for their family.</p>
