<h1>Addams Family Values (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When an adorable baby boy is added to the Addams household, Wednesday and Pugsley do not hate the baby, they just aren't necessarily excited about his existence. Ok, yeah they do hate the baby. So Wednesday and Pugsley must get rid of the new addition one way or another. Meanwhile a new nanny is added to the household who overtakes Fester. The Addams must stop the nanny, but how?</p>
<p>On any day of the week, you could expect a newborn baby to be nurtured and loved by his older sister. Except, of course, if it's Wednesday. Pubert is the latest addition to the Addams family and, to prevent sibling rivalry escalating to fratricide, Wednesday and Pugsley are shipped off to summer camp and a nanny is hired. Debby Jellinsky is great with wrinkling baldies, which makes her the perfect nanny for Pubert and the unlikely wife of Uncle Fester. The question is..."Is she grave-digging or gold-digging?"</p>
<p>Uncle fester finds true love (or is it ?) in Debbie, the Addamses's new babysitter, hired to care for the Addams' latest addition, Pubert. Debbie has her eye on Fester's money, but first she has to separate him from the rest of the family, while Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to a summer camp.</p>
<p>Pugsley and Wednesday Addams aren't very happy with the new addition to the family: their new baby brother, Pubert. Morticia is restless, and Gomez only wants her to be happy, so he tries to fix everyone's problems by hiring a nanny. The Addams' finally find the perfect nanny in Debbie: a seemingly innocent woman with an impeccable wardrobe and a way with her hands. She charms the family, especially Uncle Fester, who is head-over-heels for her. However, Wednesday and Pugsley see through her sensual facade: Debbie is only after Fester for his money. Before they can rat on her, she has the kids sent off to summer camp, as she and Fester get married. While she tries (several times) to kill Fester and make it look like an accident, Pugsley and Wednesday must battle ever-cheery camp directors and spoiled rich kids to get back to their family and warn them of Debbie's plans.</p>
<p>A comical Gothic horror-movie-type family tries to rescue their beloved uncle from his gold-digging new love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor.My Verdict: 7/10</p>
