<h1>Cat People (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Cat People originated way back in time, when humans sacrificed their women to leopards, who mated with them. Cat People look similar to humans, but must mate with other Cat People before they transform into panthers. Irene Gallier was raised by adoptive parents and meets her older brother Paul for the first time since childhood. We follow brother and sister - who seem to be the only ones of their kind left.</p>
<p>Irene Gallier, a beautiful young woman is on the bridge of sexuality; she discovers love for the first time only to find that the explosive experience brings with it tragic results. However, the tremendous passion of this girl's first romantic love is so strong, it bypasses the terror around her - including her brother's unusual demands - as it pushes her on to her own bizarre destiny. Desire... passion... blood, her lust transforms her into one of the Cat People.</p>
<p>A young woman's sexual awakening brings horror when she discovers her urges transform her into a monstrous black leopard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like Joe D'Amato's "Buried Alive," this remake of "Cat People" is technically a love story with a tough horror exterior.  Both aspects of these genres fit quite well to create an unconventional entertainment.  The movie gets especially high mileage out of two inspired leads--Nastassia Kinski as the young, attractive virgin (she also looks like a more predatory version of Isabella Rossellini); and Malcolm McDowell, who still glows with all the playful malevolence he brought to "A Clockwork Orange," as her brother, who morphs into a panther when sexually aroused.  In spite of an ill-defined supporting cast, Paul Schrader's assured direction, the bizarre script (by "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" star Alan Ormsby), those lush New Orleans locations, and the chemistry between Kinski and McDowell keep "Cat People" afloat.  It's a sexually charged horror story told with a straight face, and it works.7/10</p>
