<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Amazing how seemingly small and insignificant events can quickly snowball to dramatically change the lives of those involved.This movie had my rapt attention from beginning to end and is one of the best films I've ever seen. No, it is not an uplifting tale that ties everything up in a nice little bow at the end for the audience but that is one of it's greatest assets.Life isn't always ice cream and teddy bears. Sometimes the cowboy doesn't ride off into the sunset and that's what makes this so compelling--the realism.It's not often that I find myself talking to the movie. Pleading with the characters and wanting to jump into the movie to resolve a conflict.If you don't have to reach for the Kleenex, test your carotid for a pulse.</p>
