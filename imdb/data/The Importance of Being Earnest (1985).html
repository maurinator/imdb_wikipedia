<h1>The Importance of Being Earnest (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1890s London, two friends use the same pseudonym ("Ernest") for their on-the-sly activities. Hilarity ensues.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This play filmed for TV is without doubt the most charming version of any available attempts. It has the air of a play, which may bother movie purists, but the dialog is smooth, and the acting natural; with the witty pronouncements of Oscar Wilde sliding smoothly into what would appear to be ordinary conversation. I have a partial copy filmed from PBS, but it is missing the dagger sharp interchange between Cecily and Gwendolyn, plus another 20 minutes in the center of the play. I've been trying to get a copy of this film since 1988, which, at the end of 2004, seems like a long, long time. What amazes me is that it does not seem to be for sale!</p>
