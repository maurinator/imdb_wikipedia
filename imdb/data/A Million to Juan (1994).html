<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Romantic comedy about an honest Mexican immigrant who struggles without a green card by selling oranges on a street corner. One day a limousine pulls up and he is handed a check for $1,000,000 with instructions that he is to give the check back in 30 days. Initially he uses the check to convince people to extend credit to him. In the meantime he also attracts a woman who is in a dead end relationship with a bossy businessman. At the end of the 30 days, he finds his life in turmoil, the things he got on credit is repossessed, and he is being evicted from his dwelling and being sent back to Mexico.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Crystal Sky was (is?) one of the worst low budget companies on the market. I was unlucky enough to have worked on this awful thing... job title withheld to protect the innocent... and besides the long hours with little or no pay, what we wound up with after all our hard blood, sweat and tears was pure crap. When I finally saw it in the theatre I was completely embarrassed, and I was there by myself!! The photography was dark, murky and out of focus.... almost continually. I didn't shoot it, but rest assured that had I shot it, it would have looked probably 100% better than it did. As to the other reviewer's comments about the stereotypes: keep in mind that a Mexican was the director and could have changed things had he wanted. What we wound up with was the typical reverse racism and stereotyping that so often happens. There are shows that you wouldn't want to watch even for free. This is one. Save the hour and a half of wear on your DVD/VCR and TV.</p>
