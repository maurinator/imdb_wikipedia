<h1>Pete 'n' Tillie (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Unassuming and single thirty-three year old Tillie Shlain is at that phase of her life of being known as a soon to be spinster if she doesn't marry soon. She isn't looking forward to meeting the latest in a long string of blind dates, his name being Pete Seltzer. Pete and Tillie are not a match made in heaven, he using wisecracking and constant flirtations with women to mask his own insecurities about his average looks and not wanting to deal with life head on. Despite Tillie's guard being up with regard to Pete, he is able slowly to chip away at her defenses. They do embark on a relationship which ends up in a straightforward and somewhat mutual declaration that they will get married despite their fundamental differences. But can their relationship survive these fundamental differences, which don't change during the course of their marriage, and as they deal with the terminal malignant tumor diagnosis of their nine-year old son, Robbie?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Carol Burnett and Walter Matthau are middle aged singles at one of socialite Geraldine Paige's famous "parties". Seemingly inexperienced Burnett is unsure whether the wise-cracking and somewhat "obviously interested" Matthau is the real deal. Eventually they hit it off, get married, and have a son, whom they both adore. Time passes, Burnett learns that Matthau freely shares his sexual talents with other women, which he does not attempt to hide. When their school age son is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Burnett breaks down. The couple separates, all friends and acquaintances suggest Burnett get a divorce.The ending may be somewhat predictable, but it's a much needed "up" from the depressing 20 minutes preceding it. The brief interlude with Burnett and Paige in a "cat fight" is another welcomed distraction from compounding dramatic scenes. Matthau's constant witty remarks become an expected staple, although he does show emotion about the loss of his son.This is definitely an "adult film", although rated PG. Many issues about urban life and society in general are tackled. Pre-teens would certainly be confused and unable to make sense of some of the plot. Fans of the leads will enjoy this film</p>
