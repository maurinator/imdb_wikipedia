<h1>Christmas Every Day (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Billy Jackson is not having a good Christmas. He got a basketball and just can't make a jump shot. His Uncle David is coming to town to open a Valu-Mall, which will put his Dad's store out of business. When he tells his little sister Sarah that there is no Santa, she makes a wish that it would be Christmas every day. He now has to relive Christmas Day over and over again.</p>
<p>Billy Jackson, a miserable 16-year old, hates Christmas. From his little sister to Joey Mancuso (a local bully), he is not very fond of Greenwood Falls. Until he learns the true meaning of Christmas, Billy must relive this holiday over and over until he gets it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Trying to get in the spirit of the holidays and I start with a remake of Groundhog Day. It's not Bill Murray, but it was a sweet Christmas story about how a 13 year old (Erik von Detten) finds the true meaning of Christmas.Director Larry Peerce (Goodbye, Columbus) kept things moving smoothly and didn't get bogged down in what could have been a boring repetition."Starman" Robert Hays and Bess Armstrong ("My So-Called Life") were great as 1950s-type parents. Even George Allen made an appearance in his actual role as the Governor.Great movie to kick off my Christmas adventure.</p>
