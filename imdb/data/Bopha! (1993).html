<h1>Bopha! (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this story of a black policeman during South African apartheid, Danny Glover plays the cop, who believes he's trying to help his people, even while serving as a pawn of the racist government. When his son gets involved in the anti-apartheid movement, he finds himself torn between his family (including long-suffering wife Alfre Woodard) and what he believes is his duty.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bopha! is just a fine film with stellar acting.  Once again Danny Glover delivers a great performance the worthy of Oscar or Golden Globe and he just doesn't get it.  The struggle of one man's fight to be true to his native land or to the ruling establishment is poignantly portrayed.  Alfre Woodard and Malcolm McDowell turn in good performances also.</p>
