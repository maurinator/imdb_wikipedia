<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saw this at a film festival prior to its release and can't believe it didn't get more attention.  The actors are excellent, but, more than that, it takes pains to *adapt* the original play into something that has a shape as a film.  Never feels stagy, in spite of all the talk that seems to upset so many IMDb users.  (Not in excess of any other talk-movie.  Why would this one attract all the action fans?)  Its pieces may not all add up, but that is something that marks a great film as often as it does a bad one. (Except for the fact that there are simply fewer great films in the world.)  The quality of its observations is so good, it doesn't matter that there seem to be a few extraneous contents or that its point may not be entirely clear. It doesn't back away from complex questions and doesn't stoop to easy answers.  Excellent.Better than the American dramas getting all the awards, certainly.</p>
