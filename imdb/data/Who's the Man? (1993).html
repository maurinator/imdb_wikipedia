<h1>Who's the Man? (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ed Lover and Doctor Dre are two inept barbers. Deciding that maybe they ought to find another line of work, they join the police. A big mistake, as far as their duty sergeant, Sgt Cooper is concerned, who proceeds to harass them at every turn. Despite this, they discover a major crime, and proceed to solve them in their own unusual fashion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was so funny back in the day. In their first film, Ed Lover & Dr. Dre are hilarous as bumbling cops trying to slove a murder. The film is full of hip hop cameo's and is a semi classic when it comes to hip hop themed films mainly for the cameo's.</p>
