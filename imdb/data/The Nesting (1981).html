<h1>The Nesting (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>A writer suffering from agoraphobia rents an isolated house so she can concentrate on her writing. She doesn't know that the house is a former brothel, and is inhabited by the ghosts of dead prostitutes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is well worth renting for several reasons--one is the atmosphere of the house the leading lady rents in the countryside which is superbly eerie. The house itself is unique too in haunted house films as it is octagonal, which allows for some interesting shots and angles ( the crow's nest segment is truly nailbiting). Two, the unpleasant realism of the town folks also adds a dimension of unease that amplifies the existing tension of the ghost story and then finally merges with it. That this film was all shot on location helps add to the gritty tension that would have been missing if the producers had tried to recreate the atmosphere in a studio (something too many modern day horror films repeatedly do). As a bonus for film buffs, Gloria Grahame, of It's A Wonderful Life fame appears here as a ghost that could help solve the mystery. Although the movie is not perfect, it is a creepy romp that is more often than not unsettling on more than one level.</p>
