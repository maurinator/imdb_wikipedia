<h1>Happy New Year (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Small time crooksters Nick and Charlie have an elaborate plan to rob an exclusive jewelers store. Using a variety of disguises and posing as rich old men and women they begin the set-up, but then Nick falls for the owner of a neighbouring antique store and things get a little complicated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Falk is fantastic as a charming thief in this Americanized remake of Claude Lelouch's 1973 film "La bonne annee." With the help of partner Durning, both men set out to pull a heist on a Florida jewelery shoppe, but things don't always go as planned. Falk carries the picture with his savvy characterization, aided in many scenes by some masterful make-up, which received an Oscar nomination.</p>
