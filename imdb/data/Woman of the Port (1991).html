<h1>Woman of the Port (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Perla, a prostitute and the star in a miserable cabaret in the docks, falls in love with a sailor without knowing that he is her brother. Tomasa, Perla's mother, tries to prevent this incestuous relationship at all costs, but fails to do so. Set in a sordid environment, the director makes no concessions in this tragic love affair, which is narrated from three different points of view.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I got a tape of this movie from an inmate at a federal prison who is a student of one of my friends. The tape I saw was created after the film was a choice for the Cannes Film Festival in 1991. The inmate claims that he was inspired by Rashomon, because the story is told from the viewpoint of three different people. I enjoyed this as a story of how a woman survives poverty to bring happiness to those she loves.</p>
