<h1>Life on a String (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A blind man's master told him that after he has broken 1000 strings on his Banjo, he can open the Banjo to get a script for his eyes. After 60 years he broke the 1000th string...</p>
<p>Two blind men pursue ephemeral and unlikely hopes. One is an aged master, a wandering troubador venerated as a saint, in physical decline, waiting to break his 1,000th banjo string, an event his own master promised years before would bring him sight. The other is his apprentice, Shidou, who longs for a woman's love and is enchanted with the radiant and spirited Lanxiu. The two men are encamped outside Lanxiu's village, the saint using his energy and voice to bring peace between warring factions. Does sight await the saint when the 1000th string breaks? Can Shidou's strength of character overcome provincial prejudice to win the hand of Lanxiu and a place in the village?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Few films have effected me as this one, a quiet gem that details the long life of a blind musician searching for purpose. He is considered a saint by the local villagers, often wisely singing on the pettiness of their quarrels, and the beauty of life and brotherhood...As in Bergmans' 'Wild Strawberries', the protagonist is at a point in his life where death is around the corner. His one wish is to regain his sight, his hope had been sown by his own dying master. When a set amount of strings are plucked a secret compartment in his instrument will open, the cure inside.The film is beatifully photographed, the acting heartfelt and believable, and the music,the music...Well, the first time I saw this film, it wasn't from the beginning, in fact, I caught the last 10 minutes of it. The old man,singing to a crowd , finally excepting his fate. He muses the love that he felt for the villagers, and the disappointments and joys that came with his life. It was one of the most beautiful segments I had seen in film. I was actually brought to tears...Overall an excellent film, and I'm looking foward to seeing this director's other work.10 out of 10</p>
