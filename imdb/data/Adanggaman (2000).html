<h1>Adanggaman (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In West Africa during the late 17th century, King Adanggaman leads a war against his neighboring tribes, ordering his soldiers to torch enemy villages, kill the elderly and capture the healthy tribesmen to sell to the European slave traders. When his village falls prey to one of Adanggaman's attacks, Ossei manages to escape, but his family is murdered except for his captured mother. Chasing after the soldiers in an effort to free her, Ossei is befriended by a fierce warrior named Naka.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This West African production focuses on the slave trade in the late 17th century, and the complicity of many African tribes and tribal leaders with that trade. The story itself is not particularly riveting, but the cinematography is outstanding (though understandably dark during night time scenes) and the acting is fine. And I have to admit I've got a thing for the Amazon warriors who capture the slaves and march them to their fate.</p>
