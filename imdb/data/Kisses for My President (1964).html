<h1>Kisses for My President (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the women of America join together on election day and elect a Leslie McCloud as the US President, things get a little awkward. Especially for her husband Thad NcCloud. He, as First Husband, must take over the job as The First Lady, in the women's groups and garden parties.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Polly Bergen has just been elected President of the United States. That makes husband Fred MacMurray first lady. Even though he had his own business, he forgoes that to stay at home and becomes bored with the duties that are usually given to ladies in that position: planning the banquets, what's for supper, guiding the tours, etc. I was afraid this was going to be lame, not funny, and dated. But I was pleasantly surprised to find myself getting into it. It helps that Eli Wallach is given a larger-than-life character as a foreign diplomat asking for financial aid for his country that he misuses. It helps if you like Fred MacMurray. Arlene Dahl is an ex-suitor who still has a yen for Fred. She tries to coax him into bringing his reputation to her business, but he eventually backs out. Even the children have Secret Service following them throughout the day and that has its repercussions. Granted, it has its predictable humor about Fred as "a fish out of water." And, I agree with another reviewer that Rosalind Russell would have been a better choice than Polly Bergen, but, if you like the actors here, then you'll have a pleasant two hours with friends in some extraordinary conditions.</p>
