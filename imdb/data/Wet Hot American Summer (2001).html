<h1>Wet Hot American Summer (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The setting is Camp Firewood, the year 1981. It's the last day before everyone goes back to the real world, but there's still a summer's worth of unfinished business to resolve. At the center of the action is camp director Beth, who struggles to keep order while she falls in love with the local astrophysics professor. He is busy trying to save the camp from a deadly piece of NASA's Skylab which is hurtling toward earth. All that, plus: a dangerous waterfall rescue, love triangles, misfits, cool kids, and talking vegetable cans. The questions will all be resolved, of course, at the big talent show at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Set on the last day of camp, in the hot summer of 1981, a group of counselors try to complete their unfinished business before the day ends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is not funny.  It's Friggin' HILARIOUS.  The first time I watched it was during the winter and I laughed a few times, but remembering the motorcycle chase scene, I gave it another run and was blown away.  I haven't laughed so hard since the second time I saw "The Big Lebowski" and I ended up buying my own copy.  What is it about Summer Camp movies?  Is it nostalgia or what?  I'm really not sure. I've always had a weakness for them, but this tops all.  Ironically, it's a parody of nearly every Summer Camp movie out there and it covers many, MANY other topics that I'm just too lazy to ruin for you. It's also better than just about any other Summer Camp movie out there, and despite all the absurdity going on, it actually does a good job of catching that feeling of being at camp.  There's not much more I can say about this one without ruining most of the jokes, but I can say that if you want a comedy that's actually funny, then don't rent this.  BUY IT.  Watch it at least once a month for the rest of your life (once a week during the Summer) and encourage your friends to do the same.  This is why the term "instant classic" was invented.</p>
