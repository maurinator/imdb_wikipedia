<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hello there,You're definitely interested in this movie if you've got this far on the IMDB...If you're, like me, a child of the 80's (teenager in the 80's) who saw this movie in the cinema's with that great soundtrack from "Tangerin Dream" in it(in the middle of the cold war),than you really are going to like this movie... I was able to track down this movie on PAL VHS-Tape on Ebay(you can buy it on DVD now,zone 1 only) and saw it last night on my own again. Ok,I'll have to admit that it's dated now (look at the clothes...)but that same sad feeling that creeps slowly into your head while watching this movie is still there! I really hope with the whole of my heart that we never,and I say NEVER,have to witness the day that our chosen leaders make the same stupid mistake of launching a nuclear attack on a country like they do in this movie... This is not your typical big budget,special effects loaded action-vehicle about a full-on nuclear strike but a modest little movie about what happens to a small bunch of people that finds out by accident that their country (USA) has launched a nuclear attack against another unspecified country and are getting back what they've started....If you have your heart at the right place,then this movie grabs you by the throat and won't let go...On the other handiIf you ONLY like comedy's and big budget action movies(which I also like very much)then you're probably going to despise this one...Go now and find this little gem of a movie,I know you want to...Cheers,Dirk</p>
