<h1>The Intruder (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Ex Colonel Merton discovers a burglar ransacking his home, he is shocked to find out that the thief is a former trooper from his tank regiment. When the thief escapes, Merton tries to contact former members of the regiment, in order to find out what set the thief on the road to crime.</p>
<p>Ex regimental commander Colonel Merton catches one of his former NCOs burgling his house and investigates to find the reason behind this desperate act.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Underrated film, starring Jack Hawkins - long one of my favourite actors. There are some great scenes, not least that at the farm when the Merton character appears with a container of water for his car, immediately defusing an awkward situation with his friend being interrogated by two detectives. Watch out for character actor Edward Chapman, in a nasty role as an abusing stepfather.</p>
