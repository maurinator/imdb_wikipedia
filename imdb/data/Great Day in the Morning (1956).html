<h1>Great Day in the Morning (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After a card game Southerner Owen Pentecost finds himself the owner of a Denver hotel. Involved with two women - one who came with the hotel, and one newly arrived from the East to open a dress shop - he then has to make even more fundamental choices when, with the start of the Civil War, he becomes one of a small minority in a strongly Unionist town.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An above average western, in its direction and writing rising above a fairly typical situational action picture.  Stack is great as the profiteering Southerner unwillingly caught up in the foment of the Civil War, while he attempts to raise the son of the man he killed.  Mayo is unremarkable as the "good" woman, but Roman puts in a memorable and sincere performance as one of the town's many "bad" girls.  Tourneur's direction is what really makes this one memorable, though, from the crisp grandeur of the opening shootout at high altitudes to the concluding race with wagons through the hills of Colorado.  For Western fans, a great treat roughly in the tradition of Budd Boetticher's "Ranown" films with Randolph Scott.</p>
