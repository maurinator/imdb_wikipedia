<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently was able to view this film thanks to the Sleuth Channel. Having been a long time Leonard Nimoy fan I have had this on my "to watch" list for years...more like decades. I can only hope the increase in cable options bring us more choices like this. Not only do we see Nimoy in his post Star Trek/Mission Impossible years, but Larry Hagman as well. This film may be short in it's running time but is packed with plot and story. I for one found it refreshing from the torrent of angst driven character centered media that seems to pervade everything and everywhere. There was more than one made for TV movies that Nimoy and Hagman made during the seventies that were gems on their own. There was another film with Hagman as a motorcycle policeman who loved reading and on lunch break his motorcycle falls over on him causing him to believe he is Sherlock Holmes. This film is on the same par. As was Nimoy in "The Missing Are Deadly". Lots of rare unearthed gems out there.</p>
