<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The makers of FD obviously realized they had a great gimmick on their hands, so along came FD 2 with its spectacular opening scene involving a multiple car pileup on the interstate. The rest of the movie is just more deaths, done in various clever ways. One, involving a boy and a piece of plate glass, is the film's best killing. Ali Larter is back from the first movie, as that film's sole survivor. While she has little to do, her presence allows for a direct connection to the first film. The main reason for seeing this movie is the car pileup. It is amazing, and I haven't the slightest idea how they filmed some of it, other than to assume it must have taken a week to shoot. Gorehounds may enjoy some of the killings in this bloody flick, but it doesn't begin to approach the SAW series for true gore. It is more in keeping with THE OMEN in that sense. Recommended primarily for the opening scene.</p>
