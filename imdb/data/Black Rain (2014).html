<p>With the injection of Julia's spinal fluid, Sarah's tumor seems to be shrinking. Julia, who finally tells Alan she didn't destroy the Narvik virus, may have found a way to destroy it after people are infected. Dr. Duchamp tells Peter that people are disappearing from the facility. It seems apparent that, after a two day hiatus, the Vectors have returned and are now setting traps for humans. Hatake sees a text message on Constance Sutton's phone telling her that she is to be picked up in 6 hours. He now expects a strike team of at least 100 mercenaries to arrive. His plan is to draw them inside the facility and then destroy it.</p>
