<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the 1980s, Amitabh Bachchan has been in several movies, most of which were action films and most of which I personally disliked despite being his fan. Aakhree Raasta is actually one of the better action movies he has appeared in at that time mainly because of its well-written script and of course his own presence. The movie does have some typical action scenes and an unrealistic portrayal of corruptness and injustice, but the entire revenge track is entertaining and is interesting to watch. One has to remember that while the movie tries to show substance by portraying one man's pain, it is still a masala movie which in general is not to be taken seriously.This is the story of David, whose young wife was raped by a corrupt politician, committed suicide, and David himself was accused of murdering her and got jailed for 24 years. As he gets freed, he is determined to take revenge on the three men who are responsible for his imprisonment: the rapist, a police inspector, and a doctor, all of whom had testified against him in court. But a young police inspector is there to try to stop him, his name is Vijay, and he is actually his son, who never knew of his real father's existence, being brought up by David's best friend Mahesh. Where melodrama and romance go, the movie is a bit lacking and overdone though it has its moments. I mostly liked the sequences showing the interaction between the old Bachchan, namely David, and Sridevi's Vinita, who plays his son's love interest. There was something moving in it, which showed his humanity and her understanding of his longstanding pain. But the movie mostly works as an action thriller. The way David plans to kill all three of his enemies is fantastically done, and the many scenes of suspense are well handled, creating an entertaining picture for the family. The main reason the film works is without a doubt Amitabh Bachchan's performance. He plays the two characters very differently which makes it difficult to believe that it is actually the same person. The one who gives him full scope to win is the David character. He is totally convincing while playing a fifty plus-year-old man and is likable and moving. Sridevi is very funny as Vinita, though sadly her voice is dubbed (but let it be, the dubbing artist is none other than the great Rekha, and she does it excellently). Anupam Kher also provides some comic relief, and Jaya Pradha does her brief role well. The film's ending is excellent and some of the songs are nice, particularly "Gori Ka Saajan". Aakhree Raasta is not a particularly great movie, but it is an enjoyable one, mainly watchable for Bachchan's memorable performance.</p>
