<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this movie has a poor argument of sex with love, why? the writer was given this title? I would have made the title, The feverish. The writer of this movie is definitely an emotional illiterate, Chile does not need this kind of film, enough for sex education in Chile is very bad and the feelings are conspicuous by their absence. Educate our people by teaching them the real sex and love! The most important thing is to educate our youth, and what is really sex to prevent AIDS and other diseases, in the plot of this movie, is about a man who experiments with many women after been married. I do not like it, for my own experience, men that are never so happy to just one woman they are emotional illiterates. I don't agree when in the movie the guy who is searching for women, said that a man needs more that one vagina to be satisfied, that is not true. Too bad the writer of this movie did not do something better than this movie.</p>
