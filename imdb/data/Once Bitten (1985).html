<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of Jim Carrey's first films and definitely his first starring role. This movie was super underrated as I found it VERY funny! Especially his 2 friends in the movie, what nerds! The plot is simple-Lauren Hutton plays a  youthful beautiful vampire who will turn in into a haggard old lady if she doesnt get the blood of a virgin 3 times before Halloween. And of course guess who the virgin is?? Mark Kendall( Jim Carrey). The part in the shower where they yell "Fags in the Shower" was hilarious. I laughed so hard I cried. Definitely a very good movie for people who like comedy.</p>
