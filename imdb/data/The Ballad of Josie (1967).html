<h1>The Ballad of Josie (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Josie Minick is a widow, who is forced to fend for herself. Josie living in a cattle country, finds herself in odds and war with the cattlemen of the town, when she decides to make a sheep farm her livelihood.</p>
<p>In the Wyoming Territory, Josie Minick has just been widowed. Despite most people, including Josie herself, believing her now deceased husband Whit Minick to be a mean and not nice man, some still believe Josie killed him. Regardless, Josie's primary concern is taking care of her adolescent son, Luther Minick. Currently, his paternal grandfather, Cheyenne based Alpheus Minick, has taken custody of Luther against Josie's wishes since he feels she can't take care of him in her current situation. Although Josie has many friends and supporters, most specifically Jase Meredith, all of the men, including Jase, believe Josie, as a woman, should only be able to do what is traditionally seen as women's work, which is usually positions of subservience and drudgery. What Josie would really like to do is to move back to a large farmstead she and Whit jointly owned, but which has been neglected, to raise cattle. Unwittingly, Jase gives her an idea of how to make a living in doing something she sees as manageable, but which is against the unofficial code of the territory. Despite the range war that ensues largely led by Josie's neighbor Arch Ogden, Josie is determined to win on her own terms, all in an effort to be with Luther again. But Josie also unwittingly may get some of her closest friends killed, while jeopardizing Jase, Arch and the other political leaders' of the territory's want for Wyoming to become the forty-fourth state in the union.</p>
<p>A young woman stirs things up in a western town by raising sheep instead of cattle, and organizing the local women to demonstrate for women's suffrage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What's not to love about this film? If you can reserve judgment until the end, you'll discover the humorous and heartwarming tale of a woman who is not afraid to stand her ground! Doris Day as Josie, opposite Peter Graves' Jason, is a tremendous force to be reckoned with. In true Doris-style she takes on "the men" of Wyoming, bucking convention (in a great pair of Levi's) and daring them to deny her her basic human rights. OK, so it only takes 2 glasses of brandy to knock Josie off her feet, but she comes right back swinging all the harder! And when the dust clears, she's there, triumphant to the end. Not only does she beat back an oppressive cattle baron, she also manages to fend for herself and her son, run a sheep-raising operation, endear herself to the women of Wyoming, and win the love and admiration of a pretty swell guy, in my opinion. So who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? I give Josie 10 stars **********</p>
