<h1>Honeymoon Hotel (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jay Menlow is jilted at the altar by his fianc√©e, Cynthia Hampton,and his pal, Ross Kingsley, persuades him to use his reserved-in-advance accommodations at the Boca Roca Hotel (honeymooners only) in lieu of the doomed honeymoon, and Ross will accompany him to bolster him up and Cynthia will soon beg to have him back. Ross' gesture is not quite as altruistic as it appears. He has been fooling around with his employer's girlfriend, Sherry Nugent and figures that a brief exodus from New York and his boss, Mr. Sampson. But Mr. Sampson shows up, followed by his ever-loving wife who has decided to find out just what goes on on her husband "business" trips. Complications, including schemes to avoid the hotel's "no bachelors allowed" rule also follow.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is also Robert Goulet's movie debut. He and Robert Morse go to a "honeymoon hotel" where all the other guests are young and presumably heterosexual, newlywed couples.Of course being made in 1964, the possible gay overtones of two single men sharing a hotel room are barely hinted at.Nancy Kwan adds a little fun but otherwise the movie is mediocre. If nothing else is on it might be worth watching instead of taking a sleeping pill.</p>
