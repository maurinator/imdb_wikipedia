<h1>The Hot Rock (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Amusa approaches Dortmunder about a valuable gem in a museum that is of great signifigance to his people in Africa, stolen during colonial times. Dortmunder assembles a crack team of cat burglars and hatches an elaborate plan for stealing the gem. Despite their care and experience, circumstances and plain bad luck keep the gem just out of their reach.</p>
<p>A band of four thieves - bomb maker Greenberg, driver Murch, locksmith Kelp and the mastermind Dortmunder (who happens to be Kelp's brother-in-law) - are hired by Dr. Amusa, an African ambassador, to steal the museum-housed diamond called the Sahara Stone, a gem of cultural importance to Dr. Amusa's country. This heist is not going to be the only one that Dortmunder has to plan to retrieve the diamond, as, one time after another, the foursome manage to have the gem, but not quite in their own possession. Working with, or perhaps against the foursome in retrieving the gem is Greenberg's father (shyster lawyer). Despite the problems in getting the diamond, Dortmunder is determined to break what he calls the curse of the diamond.</p>
<p>Dortmunder and his pals plan to steal a huge diamond from a museum. But this turns out to be only the first time they have to steal it...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is taken from one of a series of books by Donald E. Westlake about John Dortmunder & his various cronies who try to pull off big capers but never quite succeed.  Anyone who likes this movie should try picking up the novel it's based on.If, as other posters have written, Robert Redford has prevented release of this movie on video then that's a shame since this is a very funny & enjoyable crime caper film with some good actors & good New York City locations.  Recently, it has been on Cinemax (which I don't have) a couple times so maybe that is a prelude to a future video re-release.</p>
