<h1>Sweet Lorraine (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In its heyday, the Lorraine Hotel saw its fair share of guests, laughter and good times. But now that the aging inn is well past its prime, owner Lillian Garber must decide whether to repair the Catskills landmark - or sell to developers. As Lillian and her zany staff enjoy what may be the Lorraine's best- and last-summer season, they realize that not even a wrecking ball can demolish life's sweetest treasures. A slice-of-life comedy about old friendships, new romance, and letting go of the past.</p>
<p>Summers at The Lorraine have been a blast, but the guests and staff have saved the best...for last.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The final season of a Catskill hotel that has seen its best days provides the framework for this film, featuring Maureen Stapleton as the owner who must decide whether or not to sell, Trini Alvarado as her granddaughter who wishes to soldier on as a partner, and a raft of others performing as employees of the hotel whose activities comprise numerous subplots.  The work is highly episodic, but most scenes are permitted to pass with virtually no development, leading to a rather downbeat feeling in the viewer, with the significance of reminiscence for the players being largely unappreciated; an entirely unfocussed exercise.</p>
