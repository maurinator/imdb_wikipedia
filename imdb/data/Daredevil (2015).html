<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have watched 7 episodes thus far and I have to say, I am both surprised and excited by this show. I should say that "Daredevil" with Ben Affleck was my childhood movie - I was 11 years old. I didn't all out hate the movie despite the poor reception, and still don't, but even as a child I recognized it could have been so much better, for a thousand and one reasons. So when I heard Netflix was making a refurbished "Daredevil", I was skeptical at its success but also curious about its angle and possibilities the show could bring. To my surprise, Netflix's Daredevil fulfills that childhood longing of a better "Daredevil" - the show is both thrilling and well designed. The plot is exceedingly engaging and thrilling.The cast is also remarkable - which was an unexpected surprise. I had some doubts about the lead but I can say that I am impressed by Charlie Cox. As a fan of True Blood, it has also been a pleasure to see Deborah Ann Woll. All and all, this show, for its make and platform, is a hit. I am more than confident the remainder of the season will continue to be just as good if not better. I highly recommend for any Comic book, Graphic Novel, and Superhero-Movie fanatic.</p>
