<h1>Poor Butterfly (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In May of 1945, the news of the fall of Berlin spread to Buenos Aires. Clara is the daughter of a socialist leader named Boris who has died unexpectedly. As Clara learns more about a father she hardly knew, she finds out slowly about his political involvement during the war. There is some unrest in Argentina, and soon, not even Clara's life is free from danger.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film describes one more sad episode in Argentina's often tragic history. POOR BUTTERFLY, however, does not deal with the 1976-82 Dirty War, military coups, or the Perons(at the film's end Gen. Peron is mentioned, but he arrives as Argentina's leader about a year later). No, this film deals with the anti-Semitism near the end of and just after WW II, rampant in Argentina during the that period. Jews were triply targeted as non-Catholic heretics by the Argentinians, as sub-human by the influx of Nazis, and as dangerous subversive Communists and Zionists by most. POOR BUTTERFLY is the story of an innocent victim of the witchhunts. The stellar international cast, the wonderful atmospheric reproduction of 1940's Bs. Aires, and a good screenplay with strict direction make this a film not to be missed by history buffs, Argentinians, Jews, socialists, and anyone interested in a top notch political drama.</p>
