<h1>Buddy (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kristoffer is a billboard hanger, 24 years old and carefree. When his girlfriend Elisabeth dumps him for the boss of her trend bureau, his life falls into pieces. He feels like a loser. By coincidence some of Kristoffer's video diaries end up with the producer of the popular talk show "Karsten Tonight" in TV2. A few weeks later Kristoffer's life has become TV entertainment. People love the sequences from his commune at Tøyen: Kristoffer's half-twisted view of his surroundings, his crazy best friend Geir, not to mention the weird web designer Stig Inge, who hasn't set foot outside the Tøyen shopping center for two years. Kristoffer's future again looks bright, everyone likes him, but revealing your life on national television comes with a price tag. As Kristoffer's future in the TV business looks brighter and brighter, his friends start suffering. Geir's big secret is revealed, and Stig Inge's personal problems are much more serious than Kristoffer first thought. It will cost him a great deal to win his friends back. Kristoffer knows what he wants, but does he have enough guts to follow his heart?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Buddy" has to be the best movie I have seen in a very long while. I loved the way the film started with the home videos before going to the complete plot, because, normally, the first and last scenes are either the most important or the "sappy love story" moments. This really showed what these men did with their lives (i.e. nothing very important). The lighting throughout the film was what really caught my attention. There were so many moments when it was almost pitch black and you could hardly see the characters. In this film it was a very effective style, making the emotions much more raw and true to life. That is a successful feat considering most Americans are used to movies having the room bright when it is supposed to be dark or nighttime....I'm sitting here by my computer and I can't help but grin foolishly because this movie made me feel just that good. I hardly ever give films a perfect score, 10 out of 10, but just this weekend I gave two films a perfect score.</p>
