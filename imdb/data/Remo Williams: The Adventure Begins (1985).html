<h1>Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An NYPD cop is 'killed' in an accident. The death is faked, and he is inducted into the organization CURE, dedicated to preserving the constitution by working outside of it. Remo is to become the enforcement wing (assassin) of CURE, and learns an ancient Korean martial art from Chiun, the Master of Sinanju. Based on the popular pulp series "The Destroyer," by Richard Sapir and Warren Murphy.</p>
<p>A cop who answers a call is ambushed. The next day he is buried. But in reality he is in a hospital and his appearance has been altered. He is then told by a man named McCleary that he now belongs to "them". "Them" being CURE an organization whose job is to battle corruption. They give him the new name of Remo Williams. He then meets the head of CURE Harold Smith, who spends most of his time sitting in front of a copmuter and perusing over reports of individuals that have to be dealt with. They then give him to Chiun, a Shinanju master, which is the art of killing someone and making it seem like an accident or natural causes. Chiun's regimen is hard on him. Smith then discovers a man named Grove, who is a defense contractor. It seems that whenever there's a case against him, the key witnesses and investigators disappear. Currently a military investigator is pursuing him about his new project which for some reason, he is tight lipped about. Smith sends McCleary and Remo to help her but Grove discovers them and wanting to know about them decides to stir things up. He sends some people to take Remo out but he outwits them. And when he tells Smith about it, Smith doesn't care who then tells him that unless they have more evidence against Grove they can't do anything and if they are about to be exposed, they have to disappear. And while Smith and McCleary have made arrangements for their demise, Remo is told that Chiun will take him out. So he and McCleary have to get the evidence they need.</p>
<p>An officially "dead" cop is trained to become an extraordinarily unique assassin in service of the US president.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't believe that I just got around to reviewing Remo Williams. This is again one of those movies that I have been watching forever and this movie deserves repeated viewing. It is a typical corny 80's action flick and it is not mind-blowing in terms of action or special effects but it is a great ride all the same. Fred Ward turns in a great performance as Remo. I've always liked Fred Ward and he's a good underrated character actor. The supporting cast mainly just fills in the blanks but they are all competent actors. The soundtrack sets just the right mood and Joel Grey deserves special praise in the portrayal of Chiun. Chiun is the greatest and toughest character ever to be in any movie ever and Chiun could kick anyone's ass. Since Grey is white and Chiun is a stock Asian character if there ever was one it may bother some people, but I would tell those people just to get over themselves and enjoy the movie. The interplay between Remo and Chiun is funny and they have great chemistry. Bottom Line: This movie rules. I would go ahead and tell you to buy it on DVD but the powers that be have only made it available in full screen so what's the point of even having it on DVD. Damn them. Damn them to hell. Anyways, enjoy.</p>
