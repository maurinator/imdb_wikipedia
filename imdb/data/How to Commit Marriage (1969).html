<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason do spew a few really funny one liners, but the movie has the look and feel of a TV sitcom.  Jane Wyman wears the same hairstyle here that she has had since the early 50's and I think she is still wearing it the same way!  This movie is harmless fluff, but it is fun to watch Bob & Jackie insult each other.  Many famous faces in this movie, Tina Louise, Tim Matheson, Joanna Cameron who later went on to the Saturday morning kids show "Shazaam & Isis".  Maureen Arthur is quite funny as a big breasted client of Bob.  After Jane gives her the once over staring at her cleavage, Maureen gets off the barb, "Well, it's nothing you couldn't buy"!  Many fat jokes at Jackie's expense.  Too bad the whole movie couldn't have been as funny as some of the jokes.  Still, not as hard to watch as all the garbage they pass off as entertainment today! (Friends, Survivor, etc)</p>
