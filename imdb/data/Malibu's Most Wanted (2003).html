<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You know the background by now so i won't bother going into the plot. Before i went to see this i pretty much expected the movie to be kind of funny, but not as funny as it could be.  I was pretty much right.  I liked the movie, there are some really great jokes and 8 mile references but i think that it could have really been even better.  All the actors did a pretty good job in their parts.  Overall, i would recommend the movie for any comedy lovers to see.</p>
