<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My wife and I saw this movie just because the video recorder was on the wrong station when it started recording. We saw who was in it, and decided to give it a shot. What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be. Woods is masterful as he plays the sardonic Joshua, the son of a stripper/hooker and an x boxer on the run from the mob or the cops or both. (Arkin) Alan Arkin is just amazing in this part. If you like him, you have to see him teaching his young son about politics, the Jewish faith and the female anatomy. The pool room scene will kill you! Joshua's mom, Linda Sorenson, always in competition with his beloved Father for Josua's affection, throws one of the greatest birthday for Joshua any kid could hope for. A total hoot.The story follows young Josh and his buddies into their adult lives. As you would imagine, they take different paths. One becomes a doctor. One a wine snob. Josh meets the girl of his dreams and marries her. (Beautiful Gabrielle Lazur.) In classic "Romeo and Juliet" fashion, they are from two different worlds. But in this case, the adversity has a slightly more comedic ending.I LOVE this film. Settig the VCR to the wrong station that day was one of the best things I've ever done!!!</p>
