<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The life of Krister has become an unending nightmare, ever since his wife's death. There seems to be no respite for this man, tormented by the errors of his past and held prisoner by a grim daily existence. Not only must he raise his newborn child alone, he must also contend with the mood swings of his older daughter Sandra, a rebellious youth harbouring deep animosity towards her father, blaming him for all the ills that have befallen the family. Faced with such difficult circumstances, Krister is slowly losing his grip on himself, which threatens the teaching career he exhibits a waning interest in. The mental health of this damaged man is deteriorating and those around him have reason to be concerned. Especially because, for some time now, Krister has been plagued by night terrors, his fitful slumber intruded upon by a mysterious woman with dark designs on him. He initially believes these visions are a symptom of serious post-traumatic shock. Krister does, after all, have a number of skeletons in his closet that gnaw at his conscience. It gradually becomes evident that this nocturnal visitor may be supernatural. Whether or not anyone believes it, he knows that a creature from folklore has placed a curse on him. And now, true calamity will descend on Krister and those close to him.</p>
<p>After the death of his beloved wife a man begins to fall apart mentally, having dreadful nightmares and finding his family and career affected. As time goes on, he begins to rapidly slip away.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just finished watching Marianne and I did enjoy it! Granted it is not this intense, nail biting Horror/Thriller, but 1 that is leaving you wanting to know the next thing happening. This movie has a lot going on and if I had to put into words or phrases the following comes to mind: woman scorned, Paranormal Activities, dealing with loss & young female adult to give you a few. Those alone will give you an idea of what all this movie entails. I like the quality of the film, the aerial shots, the way it was shot, with clear pictures and no obscured views. It didn't feel awkward, but more like this is what real people do deal with at times in everyday lives. Personally I would not call it a Horror movie, but rather a Thriller with Drama I guess. But that is my opinion. I have been watching a few movies lately that seem to have the same approach of dealing more with no music in the background and I have to say it works. It does take a bit to get used to, but I think that it also gives you a chance to show of the actors talent and let the scene speak for itself. I think the end speaks for itself and some may not like the way it ended or it didn't make it clear enough. For me it worked. Are there any problems with this movie? Perhaps, but I have no complaints. I liked it and on a day where Hurricane Sandy is barring down on us, it kind of added to the mood! Will I recommend this movie? Absolutely! So go ahead and watch it!</p>
