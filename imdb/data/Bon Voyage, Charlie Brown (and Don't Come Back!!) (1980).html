<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1980 charmer stands as the most enjoyable Peanuts movie to date. Chuck and his pals travel to France as foreign exchange students, where they learn of French culture, and get stranded at a spooky old French chateau.  One of my favorite movies as a child stills remains dear to me today.  Fans of Charlie and his pals MUST check this out.  Now let's hope for a DVD release in the near future!</p>
