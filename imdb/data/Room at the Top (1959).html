<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jack Clayton directed two masterpieces: The Innocents, Truman Capote's adaptation of Henry James's The Turn of The Screw, and Room at the Top, based on the novel by John Braine. The story of a young man on the make in postwar Britain is compelling. The black and white cinematography is silken. But what you will remember most is Simone Signoret's heartwrenching performance as a mature woman rendered helpless by her love for the opportunistic character played by Laurence Harvey.</p>
