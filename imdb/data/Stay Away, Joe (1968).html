<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pretty much everybody who ever talks about this film says it's horrible and stupid. I could not disagree more. This is a light-hearted and funny movie that left me with a smile on my face. Sure, it's silly...but it's supposed to be. And Katy Jurado and Burgess Meredith both give hilarious performances. The 4 songs in the film are fun and catchy, and as always...Elvis's voice is top-notch. Three of his friends (Charlie Hodge, Joe Esposito, and Sonny West) join him on this movie, and it only adds to the fun.Say what you want about this movie, but as an Elvis fan...I was just happy to get to spend over an hour laughing with the King.How can you stay away?</p>
