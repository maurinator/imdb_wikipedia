<h1>Shreck (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Roger, Neil, and Mike are horror movie fans who have a mock seance to bring Nazi psycho Max Shreck back from the dead. Unfortunately, the seance works and Shreck wreaks havoc in our time and in his.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw an abbreviated cut of this that's included on the special edition DVD of Vengeance of the Dead.  It's true as Don Adams says that it would work better as a horror movie with a bigger budget, but as it stands it's in the "so bad it's good" category of films.  It's got cheesy video effects, gore, wacky killings, shaky acting, the works!  Watch it with friends and laugh yer ass off!</p>
