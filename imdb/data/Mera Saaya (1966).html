<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Mera Saaya" is an incredibly striking picture and it should provide a completely pleasurable watch not only for lovers of Hindi cinema and its golden era, but also for those who love thrillers which have both tension and substance. This film is about a young lawyer who is still mourning his wife's recent death and soon learns that an alleged criminal woman who looks exactly like his late wife stands trial in court and in her defense claims to be his own wife. From then on, the story follows how Rakesh, who is totally convinced of his wife's death (having actually seen her body before it was cremated), firmly attempts to disprove her claims despite the amazingly genuine evidences she presents in court. The film has a great mix of suspense and romance, and the mystery does not get solved until the very end, although it manages to attract different assumptions from the viewers. The plot is interestingly twisted with unexpected proceedings. Raj Khosla's direction is very good; he delicately refines the film's intensity, yet makes sure the viewer keeps watching it until the fantastic ending. The film has a great Sunil Dutt, who successfully portrays the grief-stricken yet decisive Rakesh, but the greatest impact is made by Sadhana who shines in a brilliantly played dual role (even this aspect remains unclear yet unsuspected for the most part). The music is very nice, and the title song is beautifully sung by Lata Mangeshkar. All in all, "Mera Saaya" is another fine movie of 1966 (a year of many great films). I highly recommend you to watch this classic.</p>
