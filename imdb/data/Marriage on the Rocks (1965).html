<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie; wish I could get a video tape of it.  It's lite, funny, sad and has wonderful actors/actresses in it.  It's a good movie to just sit back and veg out to!.  Dean and Frank just ham it up and Deborah Kerr just fits right in and goes along with it.  That's what makes it so good!</p>
