In the hospital back home, he passes through an initial period of depression with the help of a sympathetic Dr. Brock and his faithful fianc√©e Ellen.

Soon Ken throws himself into the work rehabilitation and after a long period of physical therapy even suspects he may regain the use of his limbs. With the approval and help of the doctor, he and Ellen marry, but on their wedding night both have misgivings about the marriage: the full realization of Ellen's new responsibilities frighten her and makes her more uncertain than ever, and Ken reverts to self-pity. There is a violent argument, and he goes back to the hospital. But his blazing anger finds no sympathy from his buddies, and after a surprising conversation with Dr. Brock, Ken realizes that he must return to his wife, with whom he must try to build his new life, in spite of all the attendant difficulties.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marlon Brando's first film, "The Men" is conspicuous for many thingsincluding how little he got paid for it, the method acting that wentinto it, and the time Brando spent living like a patient in a veteran'sparaplegic hospital.   One story I heard was that one night when Brandowas at a public place with the other (real) patients, a Bible thumperstarted ranting about the power of faith.  Brando gestured the man overand asked him,  "Let me ask you something, mister.  If my faith isstrong enough, will I be able to walk again?"   The religious ranterpaused and then said,  "Yes, son.  If it is God's will, you will evenbe able to walk again."    So Brando responded with mock sincerity, "Well, by God, I am going to try right now."    With that, he made afew straining, unsuccessful attempts to raise out of his wheelchair. But then he gave it his all, stood up completely, and went tap dancingout of the establishment, much to the shock of the Bible thumper, andmuch to the boisterous laughter of the other men in wheelchairs.      I choose to believe this story is true and that it, in effect,created the scene when drunk Ray Teal comes over and starts patronizingthe characters played by Brando and Richard Erdman.   Brando asks RayTeal, "Let me ask you something, mister.  Could I marry your daughter?" A sarcastic banter ensues and eventually Brando punches out Teal whoseemed to be discovering his type casting mold as an obnoxiouscharacter who gets punched out ("Best Years of Our Lives") and abartender in Brando films ("The Wild One" and "One Eyed Jacks")   I'd like to ad a personal note to authenticate the serious messageof "The Men."   Over ten years ago I taught a Japanese secondarystudent whose English ability was extremely low.  But her desire, herdrive, and her determination to learn were extremely high.  After abouta year of struggle with words and sentences, she wrote her firstauthentic essay for me.  I had assigned an essay about someone sheadmired.  She wrote about her father who had lost his legs in anindustrial accident, but whose desire, drive, and determination tobecome independent were extremely high.   She concluded with,  "Myfather has learned to do many things.  But the most difficult thing hehas learned is how to accept help for those things he really can't do."</p>
