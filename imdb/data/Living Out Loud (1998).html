<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This American movie had a Europeen feeling for it's creativity, the subject and by the fact that there's a woman starring in it.  Do you know many regular Hollywood movie that stars a woman in a very serious way?  The feeling shown by Holly Hunter are very feminine.  We saw that very often in European films, but not quite much in the USA.  Well, everything's away from Hollywood is for me the real American cinema of the 1990's. DeVito is very moving in one of his best role in his career, And Holly Hunter... the GREAT Holly Hunter!  She can't be bad!</p>
