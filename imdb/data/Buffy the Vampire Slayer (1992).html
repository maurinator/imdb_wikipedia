<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ah, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", my favorite TV show of all time. You know, it's weird how came across it. I've always loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Movie, and I just thought they were going to play the movie on TV, but when it was a TV show, I was shocked. But I was hooked.Onto the movie. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is about a dumb blonde bimbo who lives with her rich but neglectful parents in sunny L.A. and is the most popular girl in school with her snobby friends and basketball star boyfriend. But all that changes when Buffy finds out that she is the "chosen one" who is destined to kill the vampires. Donald Sutherland plays Merrick, her watcher and trainer who is always in a trench coat and hat. When Buffy finally excepts her fate, she starts to loose it all, her friends, her cheer leading activities, her boyfriend, and life in general. She is also risking her life every single night and can't tell anyone about her being a slayer because it might endanger their lives. But there is one man, Luke Perry, or as we know him to be Pike. He is just your typical stoner teen, but when he meets Buffy and his best friend is turned into a vampire, everything changes. He, Merrick, and Buffy team together to fight the forces of darkness and one armless Pee Wee Herman.This is just a fun movie. No, it's Oscar material, but it's just a good movie to watch for a good laugh. You have to admit the death of Pee Wee's character was just too hilarious. The acting, come on! It's a teen flick, and we've got a very young Hilary Swank. We all have to start somewhere. Just have fun, and watch the series too! 8/10</p>
