<h1>A Life of Her Own (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Small town Kansas girl, Lily James, is the latest model working for the Thomas Callaway Agency in New York City. Despite her small town roots, Lily is street-wise because of her tough growing up experiences, and as such she is a good judge of character. She believes she can escape her troubles through professional success. Because of her hard work ethic, she quickly does rise to the top of her profession. She attracts the attention of Steve Harleigh, a wealthy copper mine owner. Despite they both knowing that nothing can come between them, they fall in love. The issues are that he lives and works in Montana, and that he is already married. Steve feels guilty about his marital infidelity as his wife, Nora, is physically disabled from a car accident in which he was the cause. Lily has to decide if her own happiness is worth destroying the life of a woman - an invalid - she's never met.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director, George Cukor knew great talent and put together a great cast of stars in this 1950's film. Lana Turner (Lily Brannel Jones),"Portrait in Black",'60, was still beautiful and put on a few pounds after a two year so called honeymoon in real life.  Ray Milland,(Steve Harleigh),"The Lost Weekend",'45, always had a painful expression on his face and seemed very uncomfortable cheating on his wife who was a cripple. Louis Calhern,(Lawyer for Steve),"The Asphalt Jungle",'50, gave a great supporting role keeping peace between the husband and wife.  There were constant scenes in a piano bar where the piano player kept playing the same music over and over again, which was also the theme music during the entire picture, which was rather depressing, but great in the 50's.  I never could understand why they had to use a puppet like "Charlie McCarthy" to entertain the customers in the bar, is was very out of place.  Enjoyed seeing Tom Ewell(Tom Caraway),"The Seven Year Itch",'55 give a great supporting role to Lily.  If you love to see Lana Turner and Ray Milland in the PRIME of their lives, catch this film!</p>
