<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How many times in film history has it occurred that a rip-off is better than its source material? Well, in horror films, it happens a lot and THE BURNING is a fine example. The first film churned out by modern powerhouse Miramax, THE BURNING delivers the goods and that's that.The storyline: a janitor at a summer camp is the victim of a fiery prank and returns years later to exact revenge on teens at a summer camp across the lake from his old stomping grounds. OK, not so original...in fact, you might say that it reminds you of FRIDAY THE 13TH, right? Duh, by now, you should know that this is an F13 rip-off. But here's the great part: this movie is not only gorier than F13, it is better acted, better paced, and has better characters. Three of them are played by future stars Jason Alexander, Holly Hunter (with no lines! Ha!), and Fisher Stevens! Alexander even has hair, but he plays the typical fat guy jokester. He doesn't get butchered, though.Tom Savini supposedly turned down F13 PART 2 to do the special effects for this film. It's pretty good that he did this since the effects are part of the appeal of THE BURNING. The highlight of the film: the dispatching of an entire group of kids on a raft using giant shears! Truly amazing! THE BURNING was severely cut by the MPAA and international censors as well. It has yet to turn up legally uncut in the US (other than a brief uncut video release) and it is aching for a DVD release by Anchor Bay! Until then, try to find a copy at your mom-and-pop store. You will not be disappointed!</p>
