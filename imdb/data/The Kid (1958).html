<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This whole episode is GREAT! This episode is about a personal trauma that happens to Hoby Gilman when he shoots a 16 year old kid by mistake. Hoby is distraught, and the whole town can do nothing but criticize him. Hoby is questioned by the town, but his biggest question is with himself. In this episode, Hoby has a few emotional moments. He yells at Henrietta, something we never see Hoby do; and he cries.In the end, there is no answer to his guilt or innocence. After finding out the truth, the town is ready to forgive him in hopes that he will stay, but Hoby announces he cannot live with the guilt. He must leave and try to find some way to put the incident behind him. Henrietta is her usual charming self. She wants Hoby to stay, telling him it would be soon forgotten. "In a month, who will remember, hm?" Hoby gets emotional again and states, "Me."</p>
