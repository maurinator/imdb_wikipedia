<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is hard to believe that so many years has past since I first saw "A Man from Snowy River."  I was young and borrowed it on Betamax (yes Betamax) from a friend. Although I wish that I could of seen a full screen version of it, I will have to settle with the still fantastic small screen version.The story is fairly simple.  After his father dies, a boy tries to prove he a man worthy enough to live on his beloved Snowy Mountain. In order achieve this prize, he finds work on lower ground on a big ranch. A sweet romance is set between Jim, the boy, and the Rancher's daughter, Jessica, who is a feisty and strong female.  There are wild horses, a sympathetic-but-bad-guy rancher, and beautiful scenery all which are an integral part of the story. (I don't want to give too much of the movie away).I recently saw this movie (this time on VHS)with my niece and nephew. I could not believe how much I enjoyed it again.  The thrilling horse riding scenes kept me at the edge of my seat. It is an ultimate family film one that has no foul language, gratuitous sex or violence.  Nothing is dumbed down, the viewers being treated with the respect we deserve. GO RENT IT NOW!</p>
