<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was tailor made for Diana Ross, at the height of her career, & it's a must see for all her fans. Sure, it's pure fantasy but it is very entertaining. It's in the campy/angst ridden/clich√©d genre of rags to riches movies like "Valley of The Dolls", "Back Street", "Harlow", etc. The movie is overloaded with Ross from the theme song, the (ugly) clothing she designed for it, & the fact that she's in just about every scene. It SCREAMS: 1970'S!!! But of course, Miss Ross was a dominant part of that decade (along w/the mid to late 60's). Billy Dee Williams is very good as her leading man, as he was in "Lady Sings The Blues". Ham-bone Anthony Perkins plays a flaming "Psycho" to the hilt. Take note of Miss Ross in the early part of the film. Gone are the huge hair extensions, overblown eye make up, etc. She looks great. Watch this movie for pure 1970's escapism. By the way, I love the happy ending :)!</p>
