<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, Jim Carrey fans, this is Jim doing some of his very best work. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off playing Charlie Baileygates. I was disappointed in Renee Zellweger's performance, but I'm not really a big fan of hers. (And, for the record, I'm also not too fond of Carrey's over-the-top style, but I pick and choose to make sure I see him in roles I would like.) The Farrelly brothers, known for their irreverent comedy, made this movie enjoyable and hilarious. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Just expect twists and turns that leave you laughing. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and it's not for kids. (If you've never seen a Farrelly movie, you'll need to know this!) This is not laden with "Oscar-quality" performances at all, but just something to watch when you want to laugh and not think. -- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. The plot was great, and the casting (overall) was incredible. I can't get over Charlie's family. You'll see! I find them the most fun of all. Watch it with good friends who love to laugh -- I think we can all find something like Charlie in all of us.</p>
