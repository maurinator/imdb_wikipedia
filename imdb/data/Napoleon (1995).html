With the help of a parakeet friend he learns the secrets of living alone in the island and defending himself from wild animals. He goes in search of the wild dogs, whom he finally finds. He is very happy with them, but then he gets homesick and starts to miss his mother, so he decides to go home again.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't add to the comments.  It's a wonderful movie.However, if you are one of the unfortunates that picked up the NTSC redubbed copy in the states, you are only getting half the movie.The original Aussie accents, background noises and animal sounds are much nicer in the un-dubbed version.</p>
