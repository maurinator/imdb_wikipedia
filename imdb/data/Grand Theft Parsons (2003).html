<h1>Grand Theft Parsons (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>There are times when it's right and proper to simply bury the dead. This is not one of those times... Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great "indie" film. OK, it's not about Gram Parson, per se. So what? It isn't supposed to be; it's about friendship, and general world class weirdness. If you went through those times---even as a casual observer---you'll probably love it. I did. At times it even moved me to some slight tears...while making me laugh out loud at the same moment. Not a bad little metaphor for life, if you ask me.Btw, I am a great fan of Parson's music; I have been a fan ever since "Sweetheart of the Rodeo." Sadly, one of those people who is remembered more for his influence rather than his own music. Also neglected is his sometimes writing partner Chris Hillman. They weren't the first to experiment with Country Rock (Michael Nesmith did that), but they surely were among the major players to bring it to a much larger audience.</p>
