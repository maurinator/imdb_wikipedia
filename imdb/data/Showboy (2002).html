<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fiction? "Faction?" A "Mockumentary?"  Whatever you call it, Showboy is good fun.  A showing at the 15th annual Austin Gay & Lesbian International Film Festival filled the house, and elicited howls of laughter and cheers of appreciation.  The film works best if you just go with it--don't think too much about it, suspend disbelief and let the characters get under your skin, as they will.  Think "Blair Witch Project" pseudo-reality meets the antic desperation of "Living In Oblivion."  Sort of.Christian Taylor is wonderful, and his dance lesson with Adrian Armas truly smolders.  It is easy to get caught up in the fun, and the trials and tribulations of a nice guy currently down on his luck.  Well produced, nicely shot and featuring a look behind the scenes in Las Vegas and the movie and television industry, Showboy is not what you might expect--a pleasant surprise.</p>
