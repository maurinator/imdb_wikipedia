<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"We of the Never Never" is a rare film. A near-epic made by and starring people from Australia. I can't really say whether no Hollywood people were involved, but it doesn't seem so.Most Americans will have a some trouble understanding dialogue here and there. I have spent time in Oz and N.Z. and I didn't catch some of it. Just another reason why it's a true Australian production.And it's quite upfront for 1982. The interaction/friction between Aboriginals and Whites is not most of the film, but a large part of it.But to see it is to see something uniquely Australian, IMHO. Got to read the book!</p>
