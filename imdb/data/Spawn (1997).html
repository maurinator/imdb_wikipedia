<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Given the subject matter of the original comic, a PG-13 "Spawn" is already a lame horse right out of the gate. And that's before you get to the awful acting, inept script and really, really bad '90s CGI (although to its credit, it does seem to wear that as a badge of honor). Everyone in the cast seems put out to be here, but give John Leguizamo a hand for going all-out with Clown/Violator/whatever the hell his name is. It's hard to watch this as a comic book movie when the period offered much better choices ("The Crow", "Blade"). This effort is beyond silly, a relic that shouldn't be unearthed.4/10</p>
