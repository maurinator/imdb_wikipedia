<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hell hath no fury like a man scorned.Mickey Rooney starts out as if he is a Danny Kaye milque-toast character. Taken in by Diane Foster, he soon meets up with 2 guys who want his driving talent to be used in robbing a bank.Rooney is great here as he goes from a quite guy, afraid of really living to aiding the guys in the heist.Hurt by the betrayal of Foster, she shows compassion at the end and this leads to tragedy as Rooney becomes a killer.This is really film-noir at its very best.The robbery was a complete success but the thieves were done in by personal reactions. This one is worth catching.</p>
