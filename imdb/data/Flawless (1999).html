Both of them are equally prejudiced; Koontz against homosexuals and the neighbor against close-minded straight people.</p>
<p>An ultraconservative police officer suffers a debilitating stroke and is assigned to a rehabilitative program that includes singing lessons - with the drag queen next door.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Flawless is the best movie Schumacher has ever done, when i first heard the plot, and the the bad reviews this movie got, i thought it was going to be a bad movie... anyways i saw it just because I'm a big fan of Mr.DeNiro, and believe me folks, this is a really good movie... with flawless performances... Robert DeNiro as a cop who had a stroke and couldn't move half of his body... well done... and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a transvestite who gave DeNiro singing lessons so he could recover himself of the stroke... this was also a great performance... i mean he could get to Mr.DeNiro's acting level in this film... this boy has a big future... he has already co-stared movies with actors like of course Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino (Scent of a woman), Tom Cruise (Magnolia) etc... of course this is his best performance... and yet the academy did not even nominate them for the academy award nor the film nor DeNiro or Hoffman... anyways... this is a two hour worthy movie... with a good plot, good sense of humor and flawless performances... so don't get yourself lead by others reviews and see it... you'll enjoy it. my rating 9/10.</p>
