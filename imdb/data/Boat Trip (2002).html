<h1>Boat Trip (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jerry and Nick are two best buddies whose love lives have hit rock bottom, Jerry's especially, having just vomited all over his fianc√©e on a hot air balloon trip prior to proposing to her. To escape their troubles and find women, they book a trip on board a cruise-liner, unaware the travel agent has just played a horrid trick on them in retaliation for Nick offending his secret gay lover. And that's the trick; it's a gay cruise-liner for gay men to meet and mingle. Slowly but surely, the two main characters begin to realize this and in turn get into a lot of humorous predicaments.</p>
<p>Two straight men mistakenly end up on a "gays only" cruise.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched "Boat Trip" in the privacy of my home on a rented VHS tape, which offered me the prerogative of exercising my fast forward remote option through much of the film. The premise of the story was that two straight men desperate for women are booked on gay cruise ship. The scripting of this film was subpar with many good opportunities missed for humor. Especially disappointing were the music and dance numbers, which could have been great fun. Roselyn Sanchez, who plays the ship's dance instructor, was a standout in the cast. Cuba Gooding Jr., also tried to make the best of a muddied script. One of the rare moments of inspired comedy was the casting of Roger Moore as one of the gay patrons aboard the ship. Roger cuts loose with some good lines and quirky moments in an otherwise lackluster comedy, which played more like a television sitcom than a feature film.</p>
