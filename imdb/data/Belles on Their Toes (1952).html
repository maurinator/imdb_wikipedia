<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw it this morning and I liked it. It kept my interest. I never realized there was a sequel until today. I saw the original DVD and I should have gotten it when I saw it. Now I am on the hunt for both DVDs. I don't know what it is lately with the movie industry, but I find myself watching more and more of the classics and going to the movies or renting new DVDs less and less. I mean, why would I want to watch a movie about reptiles on an airplane? There is too much terror on the airlines as it is and now some moron has to put yet another fear into people's hearts when they need to fly? I feel if the movie industry keeps going in the direction they are going, there will be more film on the editing room floor than being shown.</p>
