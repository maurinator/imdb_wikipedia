<h1>Full Disclosure (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A reporter discovers a woman who is a suspected terrorist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many many flaws, but bad writing is the main culprit here. A decent cast, some fine acting here and there, but no one could be expected to overcome the lame script. You will cringe at the hack dialogue time and time again (the actors seem to), then after awhile, you just have to laugh weakly. And I was not charmed by Penelope Ann Miller's contract killer - an incredible character delivering some of the worst lines in the movie.I hung in there and watched it only because I thought a terrorism film made just before 9/11 could be interesting - but there's no real payoff in this regard either. This movie has its moments, but there's no mystery as to why it went straight to video. Don't waste your time on this one.</p>
