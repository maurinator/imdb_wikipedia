<h1>Claudelle Inglish (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this tale of a good girl who goes very bad, a beautiful young Southern lady remains faithful to the man she loves while he is away in the military . . . until she gets a letter that he has fallen in love with another. Now, donning a tight dress and putting on new makeup, she proceeds to use her allure to seek vengeance by driving the men in her small town wild in their desire for Claudelle Inglish.</p>
<p>In rural Georgia, Claudelle Inglish is the daughter of poor tenant farmers, Clyde and Jessie Inglish. A shy girl, Claudelle is just at the age where she is receiving boy callers for the first time, while some of her peers are already getting married. Clyde wants Claudelle to be happy, eventually to marry for love as he and Jessie did, they who started dating when they were Claudelle's age. Claudelle also wants this for her life. However, Jessie hates their life, and doesn't want Claudelle to fall into the same trap as she did. As such, Jessie does whatever she can to make Claudelle end up with someone wealthy, that person specifically being widowed S.T. Crawford. S.T., who has long had his eye on Claudelle as the second Mrs. Crawford, is the Inglish's landowner, the wealthiest man in the region, old enough to be Claudelle's father, and someone Claudelle has no interest in whatsoever. Things change for Claudelle when she suffers romantic heartache for the first time. She decides to take her heartache out on the male population in general by becoming the harlot - acting and dressing seductively - in turn breaking the hearts of all the men who desire her. Claudelle's self-destructive behavior has its intended result with some tragic consequences.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Claudelle Inglish" is a well made movie but it's also rather dark and depressing. This isn't so much a complaint--I'm just trying to let you know in case you are thinking about watching it. Diane McBain stars as the title character, an innocent and nice young lady. However, she quickly transforms from this to a 'bad girl' in her small home town after she is jilted by her jerk of a fiancé. Now she uses men and cares little about them--in her odd attempt to punish men in general for her stupid fiancé. Since the film was made in the early 60s, it's really unclear whether Claudelle is sleeping around or if she's just a tease--but it is clear that she uses men to get what she wants. How will this ultimately lead to disaster? See the film.The acting is very good here--particularly by Arthur Kennedy who plays Claudelle's father. Well worth seeing and very unique...but also a tad unpleasant.</p>
