<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie isn't that funny, although you probably don't notice that what with the great actors on display - The wonderful gap toothed Terry-Thomas as a kind of Dick Dastardly Figure, Eric Sykes as his Mutley style sidekick,It has Tony Curtis romancing Susan Hampshire & The great comic actors Peter Cook & Dudley Moore as British Army men who have the best scenes and funniest lines & Gert Frobe (Goldfinger) as a escaped convict transporting stolen treasures. The scenery is wonderful as they travel throughout Europe Mostly Britain and France and has a nice 1920's feel, just don't expect many laughs, just sit back and enjoy some of the best British Actors many of who are no longer with us.All in all a likeable caper with great performancesRating 8/10</p>
