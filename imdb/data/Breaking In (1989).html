<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I caught this flick on Late Night Television about 12 years ago and was instantly drawn into it. Ever since whenever it comes on I usually watch it or at least part of it since I have seen it so many times. A True Relatively Unknown Gem. A guys flick. The two leads Burt Reynolds and Casey Siemaszko are great in it. Great Writing and Directing. Highly Entertaining. Character Development and story were spot on. Great Caper Flick for men who like Caper flicks.</p>
