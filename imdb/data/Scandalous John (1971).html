<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A crotchety old ranch owner fights to be able to live his life the way he wants to, and not the way other people--and the law--tell him he has to.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film started out pretty slow for me and probably for most who are used to quicker comedy prominent in other Disney movies of the time (such as Million Dollar Duck which was released a week after Scandalous John in 1971). But after the characters grew on me, particularly John & Paco, I found myself laughing out loud. I wasn't really pleased with some of the other actors, but they weren't so bad that they detracted from the overall film. Brian Keith makes it look fun to be a crazy old man. As the movie goes on, it gets better, so have a little patience if you're not used to this slightly slower style."It's Lilac Tweed. A MAN'S cologne."Haha!</p>
