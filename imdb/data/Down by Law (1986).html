<h1>Down by Law (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>DJ Zack and pimp Jack end up in prison for being too laid-back to avoid being framed for crimes they didn't commit.

More useful to them is the fact that Roberto knows an escape route.</p>
<p>Two different persons are introduced to us, and soon they are imprisoned. They are innocent and the arrest was set up. An interesting third person, with broken English, joins them in their cell. On his idea, they decide to escape from the prison. Their journey is the rest of the movie.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In New Orleans, Radio DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is berated by his girlfriend Laurette (Ellen Barkin) for losing his job. He gets $1000 to drive a car across town but the cops stop him and find a dead body in the trunk. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who is offered a new young white girl. Before he notices that she's underage, cops bust in and arrest him. They end up in the same cell and Roberto (Roberto Benigni) who speaks little English is brought in. He writes down phrases that strike him. He tells them that he's a card cheat who killed a man with the pool 8-ball. Then he leads them on a breakout.The camera lingers in slow moving long continuous scenes. The sparse settings give a surreal feel to it all. Everything has a dreamlike quality. It has an interesting atmosphere but it doesn't have much tension which is Jim Jarmusch's style.</p>
