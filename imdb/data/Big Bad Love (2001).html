<h1>Big Bad Love (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vietnam veteran Leon Barlow is struggling as a writer, and his personal life isn't much better. His unsympathetic ex-wife Marilyn doesn't approve of his visits with his two children, and he has problems with alcohol. Yet even when Leon manages to catch up on alimony and child support payments, things in his life seem to decline further, until a sudden tragedy catches him off guard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This essentially comic movie tells a suitably disjointed story of the crazed writing life in the South.  All the players -- Arliss Howard, Debra Winger, the underrated Paul Le Mat, Rosanna Arquette, and Angie Dickinson -- are excellent.  Instead of spoonfeeding us, the movie lets us discover the characters' past lives and motivations.  It contains grand images: someone's novel scattered in a giant patch of kudzu; a painting in progress on the side of a rusted railroad car.  Some people will like it just for the music, including by Tom Waits.</p>
