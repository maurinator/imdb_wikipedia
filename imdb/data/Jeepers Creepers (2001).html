<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>JUSTIN LONG and GINA PHILIPS are brother and sister returning home for spring break when they run into road rage and a monster who comes out of hiding after long hibernation to kill humans for body parts that keep him thriving.It's a fairly suspenseful horror flick with the leads making the usual mistakes so that they can come into contact with the flesh eating monster who clearly is after one of them for a purpose not revealed until the end.Long is amusing as the brother who has some good lines to say to his irritating sister as they squabble over how to approach the idea of hunting down a monster. His facial expression is mainly one of shock at finding dead bodies at the bottom of a barrel-shaped pipe and he keeps up the shocked look throughout most of the film.There are some genuinely scary moments and a lot of silliness in the plotting which is pretty par for the course in these kind of thrillers. At least there's one saving grace: the director doesn't use the shaky camera movement or fast cutting to get his effects. He doesn't have to. The tale is chilling enough.</p>
