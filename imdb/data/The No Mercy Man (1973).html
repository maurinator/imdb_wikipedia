<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Classic b-movie set in a mid-70's rural American hick town. Sandor is the special forces Vietnam Vet who comes back to live with the folks after an (honorable) discharge. He's a hero that his dad is proud of, but -- as were all the Vietnam Vets portrayed during this time period, he's a troubled one. The town is undergoing problems due to some "carny" type-ruffians (led by the great character actor, Sid Haig) camped out nearby. Reluctantly Sandor calls some of his Green Beret buddies to help out and the town becomes another battle site with the psychos vs. the vets. Variations of this sort of film were made throughout the '70's but usually with black actors ("The Black Six", etc.) in the lead roles. Not a bad way to waste an hour and a half if you're into this sort of film...UPDATE: I just saw this film at the New Bev theater in Los Angeles (thank you Eric Caiden) for a one-night showing with another disturbed vet flick -- "Rolling Thunder." Man, seeing this film uncut makes me appreciate it all the more. The TV version totally cut out all the subtleties of the evil gang. Not that they are that sympathetic but the writer threw in a bit about how the two blacks in the gang were frustrated with carny life and how the carnival owner was trying to give them the shaft because one of them (Rockne Tarkington) was shacking up with a white chick! Not bad at all...now if only the projectionist would have previewed the reels and not shown them out of order...ADDITIONAL UPDATE -- It's now out on DVD! Buy it while it's still in print. This is not a Jack Hill-type of classic so I doubt it will be around forever...</p>
