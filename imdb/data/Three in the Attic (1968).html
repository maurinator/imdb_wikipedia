<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It would seem to be a real shame most of those involved, from writerStephen Yada to Christopher Jones, never really got to do much else.Because this uneven, smart, well acted satire is way ahead of it's time;and still surprises.   The title gimmick, which was used to advertise the movie, is really oneof the weaker sections of the film, which looks at the battle of thesexes in a way that really does mirror it's time, while treating it'scharacters with humor and affection. If you can get a copy, it's wellworth going out of your way to see. Only the mediocre pop score does nothold up well.</p>
