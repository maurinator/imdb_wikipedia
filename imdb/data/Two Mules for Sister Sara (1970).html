<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Curious, unexpectedly talky western set in the Mexican desert. Drifter on horseback saves a nun from rape at the hands of bandits, she saves him by removing an arrow from his shoulder. The rapport between these two couldn't have looked very colorful on the printed page, but by God if stars Clint Eastwood and feisty Shirley MacLaine don't give it color and charisma. The writing isn't very expressive, and there's an odd drop-off in action after the opening sequence, but once you get attuned to the film's rhythm, it surprises you with its resonance. For action buffs, only the final shoot-out will please; for everyone else, a leisurely, though absorbing and entertaining, character-driven change-of-pace. *** from ****</p>
