<h1>Skinwalkers (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Faced with the murder of three medicine men, Navajo police must find the culprit. That the murders appear to be the work of a Skinwalker, or bad medicine man, complicate and illuminate the detective's work.</p>
<p>The story revolves around the legend of the skin walkers or "S Dubs", a folk legend from Utah about the spirits of murdered Indians returning to seek revenge upon those who disrespect the land.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having read several of Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mysteries, I was  excited to learn that one would be the first American series of PBS' Mystery.Wes Studi portrayed the "uptight" Leaphorn very well.  I first saw him as the scoundrel Magua in Last of the Mohicans, a part well suited to him. Adam Beach was also great as the more sensitive and perhaps a little naive Jim Chee. Although I guessed who the villain was in this story, it was close to the end when Leaphorn and Chee also discovered the truth.I grew up seeing Native Americans or Indians always the enemy.  It is good to see a story of Indians and their cultural ways in an everyday setting.</p>
