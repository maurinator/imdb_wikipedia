<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brotherly Love doesn't come out the way it would. It's where you live in a small town where small town values is boss. You have three brothers: Brian (Tim Quill) the total hothead, Kit (Dermot Mulroney) the horn-dog one, and Duncan(Sean Astin) the prankster. Despite the success of working at a chicken restaurant, the father,Jake (Jim Haynie) decided to close it for good. This decision drives the wedge into the family. When the other brothers find new jobs, each one of them find themselves in the world. Duncan gets frisky with the waitress he worked with. Brian gets himself involved with the upcoming mayor (Stockard Channing) before setting his sights of the single mother. Kit gets himself involved with Beverly(Daphne Zuniga), the engaged friend. brothers are brought closer to each other following the father's passing. Brian had to put his anger beside him later. And each brother had to find a way to do something about life. All too common, somewhat predictable, life it what you make of it. Could have used more to it. But the cast of the movie is great. A lot of language was used, should have more romance themes to make it a hit. Watchable to say the least. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
