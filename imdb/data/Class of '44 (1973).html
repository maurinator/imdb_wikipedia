<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked the prequel Summer of 42 a lot more. I did not find this sequel to leave me with any bright spots to remember this movie for any significant value. It almost looked as if they took some excess film from the Summer of 42 and tried to piece together this sequel by adding a few new characters and a new location.I just found that I was waiting for something (anything) to occur but the movie went no where. Oh sure there was young love, a few fight scenes, boy turns in to man and goes off to serve in the military, but these scenes did not have any flow to them. As I said I thought maybe they just edited from some scenes that were cut from the original Summer of 42.Look out for a young John Candy who has a single scene in which he has a few lines while climbing the stairwell in a home filled with students after high school graduation ceremonies about 15 minutes in to the movie.</p>
