<h1>Guns for San Sebastian (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Leon Alastray is an outlaw who has been given sanctuary by Father John, whom he then escorts to the village of San Sebastian. The village is deserted, with its cowardly residents hiding in the hills from Indians, who regularly attack the village and steal all their supplies. When Father John is murdered, the villagers mistakenly think the outlaw is the priest. Alastray at first tells them he is not a priest, but they don't believe it, and an apparent miracle seems to prove they are correct. Eventually, he assists them in regaining their confidence and defending themselves.</p>
<p>In 1743, outlaw Leon Alastray is hunted by the Spanish army but is given sanctuary by a priest in a village terrorized by marauding Yaqui Indians.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A spaghetti western surprise with Anthony Quinn as a "priest" and Charles Bronson as a Mestizo malcontent.The movie has a theme, a developed plot, some actors with charisma and an Ennio Morricone score.  That's more than most movies give you, regardless of genre.I was pleased to find that Spaghettiville isn't a one-horse (Eastwood/Leone) town.8 out of 10.</p>
