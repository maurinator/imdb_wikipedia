She gives birth to a baby boy, who she must place in an orphanage, and then adopt. Unfortunately for her, the boy, Suraj, is adopted by someone else. She manages to find out their whereabouts, and gets a job as a servant. When she is about to be molested by Shyam, a relative, Suraj witnesses this, and kills him.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This block buster movie discovered an Indian superstar. Thereafter, Rajesh Khanna instantaneously became a phenomenon. Movie after movie of his, hit on the box office and it seemed as if there is no stop to it. It was the first time that the screen idol - Dilip Kumar felt a real shock to his fame and his aura being eclipsed.Aradhana was not only a milestone for Rajesh Khanna, but as a playback singer - Kishore Kumar became the most sought after singer with the legendary success of the peppy song "Mere Sapnoon ki Rani kab aye gi tu". The quixotic appeal of Rajesh Khanna reached its zenith in this superbly directed and choreographed film. Shakti Samantha extracted the best out of a young entrant (Rajesh Khanna) in film industry. Although, Rajesh did as many as four films before this flick but no momentous success came to his way. The same success befell on Sharmila Tagore, as well and she also won real acclaim, although she had acted as an old grey haired lady in the closing half hour of the movie.</p>
