<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Enjoyable Pirate movie dealing with Brian Hawke of the Royal Navy versus the pirates of Madagascar . In 1700 A.D. , the Pirate Republic of Libertaria on the Island of Madagascar was a constant menace to the rich trade routes to India . Several days sail from his pirate fortress in the British merchant ship Monsoon . There appears Brian Hawke (Errol Flynn) , an English navy officer slashing his way through the fleet and pretending to be a deserter to infiltrate into pirate island . Once inside the port, Flynn meets the pirate captains called Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) and Roc Brasiliano (Anthony Quinn). Brian/Flynn is after Stevens , who has a valuable map . Hawke is after a map of the harbor fortifications so that it can be successfully taken by the English navy . Brian Hawke and Brasiliano capture and burn a ship carrying Princess Patma (Alice Kelley), daughter of the Great Mogul, and her governess, Molvina MacGregor (Mildred Natwick). After numerous adventures Hawke is able to aid his lover and help save his British empire , finding romance along the way . As Hawke ravished the pirate port of Madagascar to steal the love of its Corsair Queen . Amusing pirate movie , plenty of action , thrills , colorful cinematography and luxurious costumes . Although the story has been told before , tight filmmaking and nice acting win out . The picture is fast-moving , exciting and thrilling right up to the almost balletic climatic confrontation between Errol Flynn and Anthony Quinn . Average-budgeted film by Universal Pictures , using appropriate ship shots and miniature sets when possible . Good acting by Errol Flynn as a deserter in order to penetrate a well-defended pirate stronghold on Madagascar . Though Errol Flynn did most of his own stunts, he balked at the one involving sliding down through a sail on a rapier blade, which was originated by Douglas Fairbanks in The Black Pirate , the stunt was performed by a double . Flynn suffered a broken ankle during filming, and while he was recovering, Universal took advantage of the unused sets by scripting and shooting a hastily assembled B picture, Yankee Buccaneer with Jeff Chandler. Flynn starred various swashbucklers and classic adventures such as ¨Captain Blood¨, ¨The Sea Hawk¨, ¨The Prince and the pauper¨, ¨Adventures of Don Juan¨ , ¨Adventures of Captain Fabian¨ and ¨The Master of Ballantrae¨. ¨Against all flags¨ results to be one of Flynn's swashbuckling best though hasn't achieved the same classic status . There appears the gorgeous Maureen O'Hara as a hot-tempered pirate moll who swoons over Flynn ; furthermore , Alice Kelley is a tarty eyeful as a likable princess in distress who Flynn saves from the burning ship and she falls for him , too . This is a good-natured Technicolor romp with splendid cinematography by Russell Metty and evocative musical score by Hans J. Salter . The motion picture was well directed by George Sherman , a craftsman and action specialist who had already filmed other adventures . Rating : 6'5 good pirate movie , wonderful stuff . It will appeal to Errol Flynn and Maureen O'Hara fans .</p>
