<h1>Fatso (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dominick DiNapoli has always been a big kid who loved eating. It was his favorite thing. Then his cousin dies from health complications due to a lack of exercise and improper diet. Antoinette, Dominick's sister, makes him promise to see a diet doctor and lose some weight. This is very hard for Dominick, but he tries. He also finds motivation when he meets Lydia, and he discovers a love that is more intense than his love of food. He spends so much time kissing and walking around with Lydia that he no longer eats as many unhealthy things, and he loses weight without even trying.</p>
<p>Dominick DiNapoli always had an eating problem. When his overweight cousin dies of a heart attack, Dominick's brother Frankie convinces him to go on a diet. Dominick soon meets a beautiful girl named Lydia and they hit it off immediately. He must choose between his love for the girl and that of hot dogs and Chinese food, choosing the former.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Directed by the late Anne Bancroft, Fatso is as funny and humane as anything her very funny husband, Mel Brooks, directed. Bancroft evidently tapped into her Bronx background for this story of an Italian American, played sympathetically by Dom DeLuise, who runs a greeting card shop and is struggling with weight and shyness in courting a young women who opens an antique shop in the neighborhood. Bancroft plays his sister who is always nagging him about his weight (but does an hilarious dance with him in his shop) and there are many wonderful family scenes, especially the funeral near the beginning of the film of the hero's morbidly obese cousin who "always had something good to eat on him". A scene where DeLuise and his diet-support group ("Chubby Checkers") break out and go on an orgy of eating is alone worth the price of the movie. I watch this movie at least once a year and it never fails to give me great pleasure.</p>
