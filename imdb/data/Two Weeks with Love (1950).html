<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There's just something about watching an MGM musical from their golden age.  Musicals from that time had a special look and feel like nothing before or since, wonderful displays of showmanship and design and talent that cast a gorgeous glow over the screen.  Sure, they were corny and silly sometimes, but they entertained.`Two Weeks With Love' is typical of this period.  The story follows adolescent Patti Robinson (Jane Powell) on her family vacation to Kissimee in the Catskills, where she meets and falls in love with the dashing Demi Armendez (Ricardo Montalban).  Patti pursues Demi and the hotel bellboy Billy (Carleton Carpenter) pursues Patti and Patti's sister Melba (Debbie Reynolds) pursues Billy, and Patti and Melba's Mama and Papa (Ann Harding and Louis Calhern) struggle to accept that their little girl is growing up`Two Weeks' is one of those movies that's a pure joy to watch, just ninety minutes of lighthearted fun and sweetness.  It's a time capsule from a simpler age, when problems were never really as bad as they seemed and true love could conquer all.  Sigh</p>
