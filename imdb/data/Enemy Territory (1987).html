<h1>Enemy Territory (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gary Frank, an ordinary, blue collared John Doe insurance salesman, is about to learn the hard way that there're certain areas that are off-limits to all outsiders. One specific tower block Lincon, is just such a place; as it belongs to a hostile small army known as *the vampires*, who basically own it and oversee that no one who does not occupy a dwelling there, will live thought the night. He's not fully aware of how much he shouldn't be on their turf, that he doesn't belong on their *property*. But it's a simple tap on Decon a child gang member's shoulder, that seals his fate as this act prompt's The Count, their leader to come looking for reprisals from Gary. When a security guard tries to defuse the situation, he ends up dead and so does Decon, who Gary *violated* with his touch. Blamed for the Decon's death by The Count, he's now marked for death, along with anyone else who dares aid him. Stuck on the top floor, with no way down, he's only means to escape or survive is telephone repair man, Jackson (who heard the fatal shots and Gary's cries for help), wheel-chair bound paranoid Vietnam vet, Parker and elderly (but far from helpless) resident Elva Briggs and her teenage granddaughter, Toni, along with a kid in her care who can use a baseball bat better than any weapon. Stranded at their mercy in a place where even the cops won't go, Gary must do what he can, before the *vampires* catch up to him...it's going to be along hard night</p>
<p>An insurance salesman inadvertently gets trapped after dark in an apartment building that is terrorized by a street gang called "The Vampires."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was put on to this film by a friend of mine. It's a great flick with a good pace and interesting characters. Admitted some of the acting is a little shameful, but Jan Michael Vincent supplies us with a solid performance as the gruff ass kicking paraplegic with Knives in his wheel chair (how cool is that?). If you enjoyed the Warriors than this is definitely worth a watch.But why is this not on DVD? Have searched high and low and can't find it anywhere.Had to watch in poor VHS quality with German subs which was a little annoying, but did not detract from my enjoyment of the film.</p>
