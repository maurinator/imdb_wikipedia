<h1>The Lemon Drop Kid (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the Lemon Drop Kid accidentally steers Moose Moran's girl away from a winning bet, he is forced to come up with $10,000 to repay the angry gangster. Fortunately it's Christmas, a time when people can be persuaded to part with money for the right cause.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when I was only about five years old and I've loved it since.  It epitomizes the typical good hearted man in a bad situation who undergoes a character transformation worthy of old Scrooge himself.  Bob Hope plays a grifter who tries to play both sides of a scam.  All of this is infused with just the right amount of holiday fun and Christmas Carols (and even a few cracks at Bing) to make it a real holiday classic.  I would recommend it for any age and any family.</p>
