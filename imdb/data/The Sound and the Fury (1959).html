<h1>The Sound and the Fury (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Loosely based on the William Faulkner novel, this movie follows the lives and passions of the Compsons: a once-proud Southern family now just barely scraping by both financially and emotionally. Howard passes the time in a bottle; his brother Bengy is child in a man's body; sister Caddy has come crawling home after years of being kept by a string of "admirers". Only Jason, the cruel, cold-hearted adopted head of the family, and Quentin, who was abandoned at birth by Caddy, have the fire and the fury needed to put the family back on its feet again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yul Brynner is at his best! His commanding presence is spellbinding. His acting, superb as the appointed Guardian of Joanne Woodward who gives a great performance as his rebellious and attractive ward. The cast is believable, full of unusual characters that are typical of Tenessee Williams' survivors of the grandeur of the Old South, now long gone. The tension that builds between the Guardian (Yul Brynner) and his ward (Joanne Woodward) is entertaining and exciting to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it highly to anyone who would enjoy taking a look into the present day remnants of the Old South. Four stars!!!</p>
