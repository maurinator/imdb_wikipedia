<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Recently bought a ebay DVD of this film, and like the pairing of JCoburn & Shirley, as the professional physician contempories who become attracted to each other. One of hilarious early scenes has JCoburn driving in the country side in a convertible sports car, then upon upon gazing at Beautiful Shirley galloping on a horse along the road ..he loses track of the windey turns and crashes into a fence, only to have Shirley come to his aide, being a doctor. Certainly no HOF acting yet given the free wheeling love relationships of the DISCO crazed late 70's, the movie certainly captures the time, as does a similar film "The last Married Couple in America" (GSegal / Natalie Wood) of the era. Plus, I'd bet that the "King of Cool" In-Like-Flint actor with the best "Raised Eye-Brow Look" and best deep voice in Hollywood was also among the romantic suitors of Ms. MacClaine, as she interluded on Oprah, recently. Incidentally, this film was a break from the Ultra-adventure, action packed genre movies that JCoburn was doing thru much of the 60's, 70's, & 80's. I recommend it++,..and to the Republican reviewer who commented 'not to waste your time', I say 'do you remember the 70's ?' Drop the trite 'it was a smokey time' excuses, and don't deny that era didn't happen, and smile with recollection.</p>
