<h1>Gung Ho (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hunt Stevenson works for a large car manufacturer that has just been bought out by a Japanese firm. Suddenly finding himself having to justify his own job, he's forced to choose between redundancy or the seemingly inhuman Japanese work ethic that the new owners have brought with them.</p>
<p>When a Japanese car company buys an American plant, the American liaison must mediate the clash of work attitudes between the foreign management and native labor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>
