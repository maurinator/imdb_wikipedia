<h1>Threesome (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eddy and Stuart share two-thirds of a dormitory suite. Due to bureaucratic error, a woman named Alex is added to their room. At first, relations among the three are tense. Soon, however, Alex falls for Eddy, and Stuart lusts after Alex. Eddy comes to realize not only that he's gay, but that he's attracted to Stuart. The three pledge not to act on any romantic (or lustful) feelings with each other, and become close friends . . . while bottling up a lot of sexual tension.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a pretty good little movie about very close roommates.  It's got a good deal of humor and easy charm but at the end I had a bit of a "so what" feeling about it.  Also shows you of how hot Lara was before she turned into Skeletor.</p>
