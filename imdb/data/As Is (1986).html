<p>Story of a gay man who finds out he has aids and how people react.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have been searching for YEARS as to the name of this film...because I only got to see it once. I'll be truthful, I had NO IDEA what I was looking at, but I figured it out quickly...and based on my memory...there are a few things I misunderstood about it.From my memory, I remember that Robert Carradine played a man who had HIV and AIDS and I remember being saddened by the reactions of those around him when they discovered his condition. What I didn't understand, and still don't, was the reason why he was so reckless - with his life and the lives of those who were around him. It was the 80's and many of us didn't know the whole story about the disease..and the few films that were allowed to be done were sources of information as well. I know there was a background to this film (such as I had no idea this was a Broadway Play at the time) but none of this came across. Plus the fact they did not show it often enough for it to make an impact no matter how minor about this disease in a time when it was important to dispel myths and gain compassion and help.Bottom line: It's 20 years later and they need to show it again. I'm much older and I'll probably gain a better perspective as many of us who did catch it and didn't "get it" did.Now that the LOGO Channel is on many cable and satellite systems, I hope they do. And you DON'T have to be Gay or Lesbian to watch...or gain knowledge... just a human being with compassion. Show this again.</p>
