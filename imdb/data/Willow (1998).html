<h1>Willow (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Clem and Hector arrest a prostitute for possession of drugs after pulling her over in her car. Hector recognizes her as Willow Mortner, one of the clowns arrested previously (in episode 'Clown Without Pitty') and wants to help her, against Clem's advice. Willow wants to give up the name and address of her drug supplier for her freedom. No one is quite sure whether she is telling is the truth, but agree to look into it anyway. Meanwhile, Jimmy is reluctantly partnered with Officer Ray MacElwaine, a middle-aged widower and 24-year veteran of the force who just transferred in from another precinct, to investigate a number of robberies involving the theft of collection jars for a home for recovering alcoholics. Terry continues working with Christine Bannon to catch the 'Jarman'.</p>
