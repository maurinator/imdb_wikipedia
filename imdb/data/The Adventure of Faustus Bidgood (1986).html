<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Faustus Bidgood chronicles the final days in the office of the obsequious little bureaucrat of the title (played with winning numbness by Andy Jones) who, after a decidedly lachrymose revolution, becomes the first ruler of the People's Republic of Newfoundland. Possessed of a profound guilt and a pornographic imagination, Faustus walks through life like a shell-shocked Milquetoast, his febrile imagination constantly slipping between then and now, here and there, reason and nuttiness. Possessed of the formal energy of early Godard and the comic daring of Monty Python, Faustus Bidgood is an unprecedented event in English Canadian cinema'</p>
