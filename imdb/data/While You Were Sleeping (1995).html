<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was an extremely underrated movie. There were so many funny little segments and happenings in this movie. Like when the newspaper boy was delivering papers, and when they had the dinner conversation. If you just watch the movie for some good laughs and don't try to expect some big, deep storyline you will find that it is a VERY enjoyable movie. It had us all laughing till we......well you know what I mean. Sit back, get some popcorn and enjoy the show. There's nothing wrong with silly, senseless humor, is there? Even my husband enjoyed it. I've seen this movie more times than I probably should admit. But I laugh every time I see it. Another good choice...How to meet a guy in 10 days.</p>
