<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At almost three hours one might imagine this would be a very slow haul but I hadn't realised the length at the start and never felt it drag. I think in retrospect it probably should be tightened a little, maybe some of the surreal stuff at the hot spar, because I feel I want to watch it again immediately but the length now seems daunting. How silly. Anyway what starts off as a fairly standard Tarantino influenced yakuza movie develops very much a style and pace of it's own. Lovely wry humour and acute and memorable observations. Dealing with yet another of Japan's guilty secrets, this time the fate of Japanese brought up with one or other parents was a Brazilian or in this case Peruvian migrant worker, before they decided they didn't need them any more. So this convoluted tale is hard to convey in a few words but is certainly violent, gentle, blunt and poetic. Much use is made of the Japanese outdoors for a change and there is always something happening or about to happen and always most involving and likable. Even the pipe music was enjoyable!</p>
