<h1>Jumping Jacks (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hap Smith, nightclub entertainer, has a new act since his former partner Chick Allen joined the army: with lovely new partner Betsy Carter, Hap plays a clownish parody of a soldier. Meanwhile, Chick is organizing a soldier show at Fort Benning and finds he needs his old partner's help. To get onto the base, Hap impersonates a hapless real soldier, Dogface Dolan; but circumstances force them to prolong the masquerade, creating an increasingly tangled Army-sized snafu.</p>
<p>Nightclub comic Hap Smith assumes the identity of another soldier so he can tour army bases in a revue with his ex-partner Chuck Allen.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow...talk about your contrived plots! The film begins with Jerry and his female partner working on their stage act. Out of the blue, Jerry gets a cryptic letter--telling him her was needed for government business. When he goes to where the letter tells him, he finds out his old partner (Dean) needs him to help him put on some sort of show for the army. It seems that Dean is now a paratrooper and plans on having Jerry take on the identity of a guy in his unit so they can put on a show together. While this idea is ridiculous, it's even more so when Jerry is stuck in the paratroopers and cannot get out--even though he really wants to.This film finds Jerry Lewis at his most spastic and even louder than usual--making you wonder how anyone could possibly mistake him for a soldier (or human)! In addition, because of the performing angle, there are a larger than usual number of musical numbers--along with dancing and other choreography. If you like this, you're in luck. As for me, this mix created a less satisfying sort of Martin & Lewis film. Fortunately, the film was saved (somewhat) by the notion of idiot Jerry accidentally succeeding and becoming a great soldier! But to me, this isn't enough to make this anything other than a loud time-passer.</p>
