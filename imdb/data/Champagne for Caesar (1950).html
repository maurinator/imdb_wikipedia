<p>Beauregard Bottomley is a eccentric but unemployed genius who confidently believes he knows everything and is able to back up his claim. After being rejected in a job interview by the pompous Burnbridge Waters, president of a soap company, because he has a wry sense of humor, the idiosyncratic scholar decides to go on the company's popular quiz show. Contestants go on dressed in costumes symbolizing their academic specialty, so he dresses as the encyclopedia. After answering his alloted amount of questions, Bottomley challenges the show's brash, wise-cracking emcee to allow him to come back the following week to gamble double or nothing on another question. Sensing a ratings advantage, the dismissive Waters allows him to do so. the weekly ratings and soap sales go through the roof, but as Bottomly confidently answers every question put to him, it becomes apparent to Waters that the genius intends to bankrupt him of his 40 million dollars. He then recruits bright and beautiful Flame O'Neill to become involved with the confirmed bachelor and discover his Achilles heel.</p>
<p>In order to get even with the pompous president of a soap company, an eccentric genius goes on his quiz show in order to bankrupt his company.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why this movie is not considered up there with the great comedies of the 1950's is beyond me - I mean, Some Like It Hot is funny for two viewings, tops. There are scenes in this movie that never ever fail to make me laugh, and I've seen the film six or seven times by now. All of these are scenes with Vincent Price, who gives what is probably among the top five comedic performances in the history of American film here -- at least if you consider those by non-comedians. It's no surprise that Price could go over the top, as he did in all those Roger Corman horror movies, but here, it's expressly for comic effect (rather than camp effect -- not the same thing). He was at a transitional point in his career: he was through playing hunky-but-wimpy second male leads and tormented romantic heroes, and was soon to embark on his second career as Mr. Drive-In Horror Movie Star. So this is really his only true comedy performance, and he is brilliant as corporate nutjob Burnbridge Waters.Everybody else here is great*: Ronald Colman is simply perfect as Beauregard Bottomley, an unemployable with a genius range IQ. (I am of the opinion that Alex Trebek wanted to grow up to be Ronald Colman -- not necessarily as this character, just in general). Celeste Holm is great as always as temptress Flame O'Neill, hired by Waters to rattle Colman's character to the point where he starts losing on the quiz show. She's very much in the tradition of Carole Lombard: beautiful and a super actress in anything, very adept at comedy and always intensely likable. Barbara Britton as Bottomley's sister Gwenn is another charmer, cute as a bug's ear.*Then there's Art Linkletter: OK, he's great as the quiz show host -- he did that for a living in real life. But there's something kinda creepy about him, plus he's no matin√©e idol, and I always feel a little skeeved at his scenes romancing Barbara Britton. It's taken as gospel that no unattached lead character remain unattached at the end of a movie, but couldn't they have paired her off with one of Waters' employees, a cab driver, ANYBODY? OR could they have hired some second-tier pretty boy to play Linkletter's role? This is my only quibble with the film, and it's why I rate it a 9 rather than a 10.</p>
