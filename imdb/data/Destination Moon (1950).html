<h1>Destination Moon (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After their latest rocket fails, Dr. Charles Cargraves and retired General Thayer have to start over again. This time, Gen. Thayer approaches Jim Barnes, the head of his own aviation construction firms to help build a rocket that will take them to the moon. Together they gather the captains of industry and all pledge to support the goals of having the United States be the first to put a man on the moon. They build their rocket and successfully leave the Earth's gravitational pull and make the landing as scheduled. Barnes has miscalculated their fuel consumption however and after stripping the ship bare, they are still 100 lbs too heavy meaning that one of them will have to stay behind.</p>
<p>The rocket engineer Dr. Charles Cargraves blows-up a rocket during the tests and loses the government funding. Together with his friends General Thayer and Jim Barnes, they raise funds from American industrialists to build a rocket using atomic engine in the desert to reach the moon. However the public opinion is against the project afraid of radiation leakage in the spot and they decide to anticipate the launch of the spaceship without tests. The radar and radio operator Joe Sweeney is invited and teams-up with them and the rocket is called Luna. During the descent on the moon, they use too much fuel to safely land. After the exploration of the lunar soil, Charles realizes that they need to reduce the weight of the rocket to launch back to Earth based on the remaining fuel. They remove all the essential equipment but Charles concludes that someone must be left behind. Will they return to Earth?</p>
<p>One of the first science fiction films to attempt a high level of accurate technical detail tells the story of the first trip to the Moon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can go for quite a while listing the movie's weaknesses-script, actors, et cetera.  But with an idea by Robert Heinlein, Chesley Bonestell handling the astronomical artwork, George Pal as producer and a special bit of animation by Walter Lantz starring Woody Woodpecker done just for the movie, what else matters?  Anyone who recognizes all those names and appreciates them understands just what I mean.  Since everyone coming here is likely to know Pal and Woody, I won't say any more.  For the rest, gather round my children and attend.  Rober Heinlein was the dean of Science Fiction writers.  He spun off enough ideas as throwaways to do another writer proud for two careers!  As for Chesley Bonestell, quite simply, he was the greatest artist ever when it came to astronomic art.  Paintings he did look so real, you'd swear that they were photographs and so accurate that you'd swear he'd been there.  Not only did he have no equal, he lapped the field two or three times over.  If I ever strike it rich, the first extravagance would be a Bonestell.  Genius strikes rarely.  Greatness with only somewhat more frequency.  This film, flawed in many ways, is shadowed by greatness and touched by at least one genius.</p>
