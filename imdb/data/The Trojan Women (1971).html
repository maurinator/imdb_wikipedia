<h1>The Trojan Women (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hecuba and the other women of Troy rise to find their city in ruins and their cause lost. The city has fallen into Greek hands and it is likely their lot to become slaves of Greek soldiers. A messenger approaches to inform them that the lots have been drawn and each woman will be taken to the man who drew for her. Of particular interest is Hecuba's daughter, Cassandra, who is chosen for the Greek kings bedchamber. She has received word of this news already and is in hiding because she has sworn an oath to the gods that she will live as a virgin. When she is found she has some particularly nasty things to say about treatment at Greek hands.</p>
<p>After the fall of Troy to the Greek invading army, the Trojan women weep over their lost city, families, and honour, as they are taken away as Greek slaves.</p>
<p>The women of Troy face enslavement after the fall of their city.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great version of Euripides' Trojan women. They got an all-star cast that truly does justice to the original play. The movie is done very much like the play, but this is quite a positive thing, it doesn't end up being some idiotic Keanu Reaves "Much Ado About Nothing".Katharine Hepburn gives her all as Hecuba, the Queen of the now destroyed Troy, and all of the other actresses give great renditions. Irene Pappas, the national actress of Greece, did a magnificent job as Helen, the woman who started it all. Brian Blessed played the messenger as only he could, and Vanessa Redgrave and Genevieve Bujold truly capture the pain and anguish of these women as they face their inevitable fate.The music, too, really did set the atmosphere, I could feel a chill up my spine when they played that otherwise simple melody. The costumes are suitably appropriate, and I'd love to know where they found that ancient-looking wall that is meant to represent Troy, it adds a nice touch.All in all, this is a movie that you have to see at least once in your life, your outlook on the horrors of war will never be the same.</p>
