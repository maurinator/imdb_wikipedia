<h1>Aankhen (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vijay Singh Rajput (Amitabh Bachchan) is a quirky manager of Vilasrao Jefferson Bank. He is extremely strict at work and believes in pushing his workers to the limit. This means that his superiors hold him in high regard for his unblemished reputation and excellent track record. But things go terribly wrong for the honest bank manager when he finds one of his own employees trying to con the customers. At this, he loses his temper and gets physical with the employee. This doesn't go down well with his superiors and they decide that Rajput is now a liability to the bank and they sack him. Amitabh can't believe the Board of Directors and his mind is filled with revenge and what better revenge than robbing the bank himself, ironic as it may sound. He decides that he must think of a plan that will hit the bank where it hurts the most - in its safe where all the money is kept. Rajput blackmails Neha (Sushmita Sen) to use her professional skills to help his plan, to train three blind men to rob the bank for him. Rajput then gets together a team of three blind men Vishwas Prajapati (Akshay Kumar), Arjun Verma (Arjun Rampal) and Ilias (Paresh Rawal) who will help him obtain his vengeance and make a heap of money at the same time. After gruelling training sessions, the three succeed in robbing the bank, but things go haywire. What happens next?</p>
<p>Vijay Singh Rajput lives a wealthy lifestyle and has been working with a bank for the last 30 years. He is a trusted employee and is looked upon favorably by the bank's management. Vijay's Achilles heel is his temper, which does get him reprimanded albeit with a mere rap on his knuckles, but when he assaults a bank employee who conned an old bank customer, he is fired. Angered he decides to get his vengeance by robbing the bank as no one knows the internal security as well as he does. Vijay, a perfectionist, decides to pull this heist off without arousing any suspicion upon himself, and sets off by abducting a child of an Instructress, Neha, for the school of the blind, and coercing her to cooperate with him and train three other blind males he has recruited to carry out this job, namely Ilias, Arjun Verma, and Vishwas Prajapati. Watch what happens after they successfully rob the bank and try to go about their individual lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Aankhen means 'eyes', the story of training three blind people to rob a bank in getting revenge proves for on the edge of the seat viewing. Amitabh again gives priceless acting, Akshay and Arjun Rampal are good supporting cast but Paresh Rawal is great adding great humour. Some of the songs in the films are obviously intended for the indian audience, as films fare poorly in record sales if a film has no songs.The editing seems a littles inaccurate at times and this is clearly a flaw in the film, if bollywood was to bring out more original themes such as this film it would propel it to a new level.On the whole, vintage amitabh and some scenes in the film especially between Akshay and the former are ones to remember.</p>
