<h1>Johnny Stecchino (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Good hearted but not very wordly-wise, Dante is happy driving the school bus for a group of mentally handicapped children, while feeling he is somehow missing out on life and love. So he is very excited when after nearly being knocked down by her car he meets Maria, who seems immediately enamoured of him. He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.</p>
<p>Dante is the ultimate loser. Nothing seems to work for him - especially in love. Suddenly, a beautiful and rich woman gives him some hope. However, the deal involves Dante going to Sicily where the woman's husband is an infamous gangster known as Johnny the Toothpick ("stecchino" in Italian). Johnny has denounced some of the local mafiosi to the police so their friends want him dead. So, why not get Dante killed instead.</p>
<p>A kindhearted but bumbling idiot who likes to steal bananas, is passed off for a snitch hiding from the mob.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wonderful roles for Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi. I am not sure whether they got together before or after this film, but if they co-operate in their marriage as much as they do in this film, they will stay together forever. This movie is so extraordinary well written, although you must understand some of the Italian life and habits. The subtle humor will be mostly appreciated I guess by Italians who have moved abroad. They will recognize the bits and pieces that ridicule the 'ol'country', but they are no longer part of it. In a way. Insurance fraud, coke sniffing, corrupted politicians, bribed judges... The people that are best of are the ones that either don't know or don't want to know.</p>
