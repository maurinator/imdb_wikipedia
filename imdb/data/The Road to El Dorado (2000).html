<h1>The Road to El Dorado (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story is about two swindlers who get their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado while pulling off some sort of scam. Their plan goes bad and the rogues end up lost at sea after a number of misfortunes. Oddly enough, they end up on the shores of El Dorado and are worshiped by the natives for their foreign appearance.</p>
<p>The story is about two swindlers Miguel and Tulio, two wanted conmen who gets their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. After they are shipwrecked in the New World with a scene-stealing horse. The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise? Of course there are some obstacles: a high priest is locked in a power struggle with the benevolent chief and the perfunctory girlfriend puts the two friends at odds. But in the end, they must make a huge moral decision that leads to a swashbuckling conclusion!</p>
<p>In 1517, Spanish-wanted street swindlers Miguel and Tulio's uncanny luck gets them a map to El Dorado and a stowaway passage, albeit in Cortez's stocks destined for floggings and slavery on Cuba. They escape, thanks to the war horse Altivo; a storm brings them on a Mexican shore fitting the map, so they enter the city, where high priest Tzekel-Kan welcomes them as the prophesied gods, accidentally confirmed by a volcanic rumble. Only temple thief Chel sees trough their game, so she's allowed into the scam to steal the golden treasure. They abolish human sacrifices and learn the high-priest rivals for power with the chief, so they play them against each-other. Meanwhile Cortez arrives and follows the tramps' trail. When Tzekel-Kan tricks Tullio into reintroducing sacrifices, the river of blood tradition requires to start the jaguar age, Miguel braves him, making a dangerous enemy who uses black magic having realized they're mortal. Now two major dangers attack the city and its 'patron gods'.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is nothing much that is bad that is to be said about this film. The characters, Tulio and Miguel, were fun, entertaining, and the plot itself was much the same way. I was surprised, however (though not necessarily disappointed), at how Disney-like this movie was, coming from Dream Works. Dream Works tends to go for a more "crude" or "sarcastic" humor. They don't seem to like using two scrawny, goofy men as main characters or having an antagonist that is so evil that you can hardly express how evilly evil he is. Both of these were present in the movie, as well as a scene where Tulio and Miguel *gasp* dance and sing! Verrrrry Disney-like if you ask me.Either way, I found the movie to be excellent. It is nothing that makes your jaw drop in absolute awe, but it makes your side hurt aplenty. The music was very fitting, and sounded beautiful. The animation stunned me, even though the movie had been more than 5 years old when I saw it the first time (perhaps showing Dream Works animation superiority over Disney?) I would definitely recommend it for if you are looking for a good laugh.</p>
