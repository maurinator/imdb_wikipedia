<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Science fiction is a literature of ideas.  Science fiction movies, however, are usually typified by their lack of ideas (although often fun for all that).The novel "The Lathe of Heaven" was chock full of ideas, and the movie didn't sell the book short.  Just about everything in Le Guin's vision about how the road to, uhhh, insomnia is paved with good intention came right across in this TV movie adaptation.  I wish I could see it again.Science fiction wouldn't have such a reputation for silliness if other movies took such pains to match the quality of "The Lathe of Heaven's" intellectual effects instead of matching "Star Wars's" special effects.</p>
