<h1>The Power Within (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stan Dryer, a teen afraid to even ask a girl to the prom, finds courage and extreme martial arts skill when he is given a ring by an old man he tried to save from a group of attackers. The ring is a mate to a ring stolen by a double-dealing art thief who had been hired to steal it by a criminal mastermind who wanted it for its mystical powers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Attractive sixteen-year-old Ted Jan "T.J." Roberts (as Stanley "Stan" Dryer) is urged to hook up with older pretty woman Tracy Melchior (as Sandy Applegate) after the senior prom, by chubby pal Keith Coogan (as Eric). Although Ms. Melchior seems ripe and willing, Mr. Roberts is too shy to get up the nerve. Meanwhile, martial arts badass William Zabka (as Raymond Vonn) is looking to acquire, by any violent means, an ancient Chinese ring to match the one he wears - the wearer of both rings is promised incalculable power.Roberts' mother, actress Karen Valentine (as Clyda) worries that her son might be a wimp, but worries more when he is given the other ring of power, which is formerly worn by his mystical guardian angel, Gerald Okamura (as Yung). Wearing the ring, Roberts becomes a martial arts master, and gets his girl. But, he must also battle Mr. Zabka, who wants both rings of power. Nice to see "Griffith Observatory", Roberts as a smaller guy with a killer kick, and Ms. Valentine aka "Pigtail Peggy" - or was it "Alice Johnson"? ***** The Power Within (10/24/95) Art Camacho ~ Ted Jan Roberts, William Zabka , Karen Valentine, Keith Coogan</p>
