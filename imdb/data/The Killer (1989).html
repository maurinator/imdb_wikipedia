<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chow Yun Fat and John Woo strike again.  The Killer is not your run of the mill action flick.  It features characters you care about, jaw-dropping action sequences, and , best of all, Chow Yun Fat.  He's always supercool.  Chow and co-star Danny Lee play very similar characters but are on opposite sides of the law.  It makes the film work very well.  The heroes can relate to one another because they have both injured the innocent while doing their jobs.  Another great actor in the film is Kong Chu in the role of Sydney, the one handed hitman.  Being in the middle of the fray, he makes for an interesting character.  There is a great scene involving Sydney's betrayal.  Chow is so amazing with his emotions in this scene.  He's not just an international action superstar, he's an underrated and incredible actor as well.  That's what makes The Killer more than just another action movie.  Woo's direction always helps too.  The Killer boasts one of the best and most epic shootouts in film history.  Woo's older films are as stylistic as they get, I mean stylistic as hell.  Chow Yun Fat and John Woo make an incredible duo.  Nicholas Cage is no replacement, it's high time they work together again.</p>
