<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Granted its been a LONG time since the last time I saw this film but it was based upon the great series of the 80's "The Littles" but still alike the MST3K movie it places a good intro to the series so OK it was a bit different from the series(henry bigg had an uncle augustus in this film) so other than that its pretty much the same from the series & it even has the voices of grimlock (transformers) & rainbow brite (gregg berger & bettina) in the film so bye for now & if you enjoyed the 80's show "The littles" you'll highly enjoy this too & even if you never heard of the series its still a good buy & view,well bye.</p>
