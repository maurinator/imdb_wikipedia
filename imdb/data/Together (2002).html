<h1>Together (2002)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Come Together" is by the numbers formula romantic comedy fluff about the coming together of a young adult couple which is hip enough to not be maudlin, lively enough to not be boring, funny enough to not be taken too seriously, and romantic enough to make the end worth the wait. An okay watch which will likely be most appreciated by young at heart.</p>
