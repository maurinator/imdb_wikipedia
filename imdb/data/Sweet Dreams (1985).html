<h1>Sweet Dreams (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Patsy Cline was the first female solo artist to be elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Thirty-two years after her untimely death in a plane crash in Tennessee, her "Greatest Hits" album sold over six million copies. Loved by her fans today as much - if not more - than she was at the height of her fame, the life, the loves and most of all the voice of Patsy Cline is legendary. This film tells the story of the passionate, fun-loving, soft-spoken, loud-living life of one of country music's - and one of popular music's - greatest singing stars. This film covers the years 1956 through 1963, from her rise to fame and the top of the charts through TB talent shows and country bars - through her turbulent marriage to Charlie Dick and the demands of touring which would lead to the fatal plane crash.</p>
<p>Jessica Lange stunningly portrays Patsy Cline, the velvet-voiced country music singer who died in a tragic plane crash at the height of her fame.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have watched this movie at least 30 times.  Patsy Cline is one of my absolute favorite country singers, as I grew up in the 50's and she was both a pop and country chart topper.  I also grew up in northern Minnesota, so when a fellow Minnesotan played the role of Patsy, I had to see this movie. Jessica Lange was dynamic in portraying Patsy as someone who "just wanted to make things right".  The other actors in the movie also deserved oscar nominations along with Jessica, as they completed this story.  This movie is being shown a lot lately on HBO, TNT, CMT, and AMC.  I highly recommend it.</p>
