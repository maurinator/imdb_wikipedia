<h1>Air Force One (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The President of the USA goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new "Zero-tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One (the President's official plane) and take the passengers (including his wife and daughter) hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honor winner, so the terrorists may be in for a surprise...</p>
<p>A thriller about a steadfast U.S. President who has just told the world he will not negotiate with terrorists. Now, Russian neo-nationalists have hijacked Air Force One and the President is faced with a nearly impossible decision: give in to terrorist demands or sacrifice not only the country's dignity, but the lives of his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>Hijackers seize the plane carrying the President of the United States and his family, but he - an ex-soldier - works from hiding to defeat them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very clich√©d but interesting film with a two-fisted President of the United States (Harrison Ford) literally taking on terrorism himself on board his jet, Air Force One. Believable? Of course not, but it's an story that hooks you in and keeps you involved all the way. It could have been trimmed down, to be sure, but the better-than-average action scenes help make up for that. While not blatant, the film did have it's typical Hollywood Liberal slant with political correctness abounding....so be aware of that. It borders on reverse sexism and racism and there is a fair share of profanity in here if you are concerned about that. The sound on the DVD is tremendous with some excellent rear speaker action. It would be great demo model for anyone's surround sound system. It adds measurably to the enjoyment of the film. If you like action and a lot of tension, this film has it. It's one of those movies that wears you out by the end of it!</p>
