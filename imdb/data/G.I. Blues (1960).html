<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Elvis's first film back after his military service is not as good as his best film King Creole nor as flashy and fun as Viva Las Vegas but still falls into the plus category as far as his films go. He has a talented co-star in Juliet Prowse, her exotic brand of sex appeal adds a nice component that adds a different spice to the movie. While the script is innocuous it certainly is far better than the slug he would be making just a few years later like Speedway and Harum Scarum. He looks very fetching in his uniform, the songs, including Blue Suede Shoes, by and large are pretty good and the film has many attractive locations. A pleasant diversion.</p>
