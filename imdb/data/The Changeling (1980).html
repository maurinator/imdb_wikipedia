<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>THE CHANGELING is by far the scariest film I have ever seen.  It's not because of scary monsters or gory F/X.  This film has very few gory moments or F/X. It scares with great story telling, sounds and dark corners.  It's actually quite a sad story as well.  The acting is excellent and the director is quite accomplished.  I am a huge movie fanatic and HORROR is one of my favorite genres; and I realize there are very few actually good horror movies, so take my word this is great film making.  WATCH IT ALONE and you will be very unpleased by how scared you are.  This is not a film to watch with a group.  I tried that once and everyone thought it was boring.  You need the quiet to pay attention to build the natural tension and fear.  Enjoy.  They don't make them better than this.  This is up there with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON as the best of the horror genre!!!</p>
