<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, I'm a sci-fi movie buff. So I'm the type of person who'd like this film.But I do have some basic standards, and Freejack is just the right sort of campy flick, sort of a "Blade Runner" gone slumming. It's bad, but it's a good bad, if you're into cult classics.Who should see this film:-- sci-fi movie buffs, but don't go out of your way, oh and see Demolition Man too which is similar but better-- nobody elseI enjoyed the film, but campy special effects and silly plot mean I can only give it a 6 out of 10.</p>
