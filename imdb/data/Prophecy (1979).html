<h1>Prophecy (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Savage beast, grown to monstrous size and driven mad by toxic wastes that are poisoning the waters, spreads terror and death on a Maine countryside.</p>
<p>A Doctor (Robert Foxworth) and his wife (Talia Shire), at the request of a concerned friend, travel to Maine to research the impact that the lumber industry has on the environment. They find fish that grow many times their normal size, and also a series of bizarre and grisly murders. Veteran Director John Frankenheimer manages to present "Prophecy" as both a monster movie, and a suspenseful tale about the deadly forces which result from the pollution of the environment.</p>
<p>The idealistic Dr. Robert Verner is invited by his friend Vic to travel to the Maine with his wife Maggie working for the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a report about the dispute between Indians "Opies" (meaning the original people) and the lumberjacks. Maggie is pregnant but she has not told to Robert since he does not want to have children. Robert and Maggie are welcomed by the director of the paper mill Bethel Isely that drives them to their cabin in the woods. However they find an Indian blockage of the road and witness a conflict between the leader of the Opies John Hawks and Isely and his men. On the next morning, Robert goes fishing and he sees a huge salmon in the river. Then they meet with John Hawk and his wife Ramona and they tell that their people are ill and most of their babies are born with deformation. They also hear about the legendary Katahdin and visit the Garden of Eden of the Opies, where Robert finds weird plants with roots on the surface and a huge tadpole. Robert continues to investigate and discovers that the industry is using methyl mercury in the process that is causing the mutagen in the environment.</p>
<p>A log company's waste mutates the environment, creating a giant killer bear-monster.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Released by Paramount in 1979, Prophecy, along with Alien, Phantasm and George Romero's Dawn of the Dead formed an unholy quartet of horror movies that assaulted the hearts, minds and stomachs of cinema-goers during that infamous 'summer of fear'. Of these four films probably the most neglected, and deservedly so, is John Frankenheimer's ecological horror film starring Robert Foxworth, Talia Shire, Armand Assante, Richard Dysart and a carnivorous, drooling fifteen foot mutant bear.Working from a ludicrous script by David Seltzer, author of The Omen (1976 & 2006), the film makes a plaintive plea about the dangers of a contaminating industry on the natural environment and how it could spawn obscene freaks of nature that may one day bite back. Seltzer specialises in films that explore the end of the world as exemplified in both incarnations of The Omen as well as his bug-movie The Hellstrom Chronicle (1971). Needless to say, Prophecy is equally dour in its predictions.Tagged with the subtitle 'the monster movie', it has its moments of genuine suspense, especially in the impressive opening sequence where several mountaineers descend into a gloomy, Lovecraftian-like pit where the titular monster decimates them in the darkness. Unfortunately, there are not enough scenes of this kind and most other shocks in the film are not so cleverly engineered by the director. This is a shame.The performances by Foxworth and Shire are heartfelt and everybody else tries hard but the material is so ridiculous that the results are sometimes painful to watch. The special effects by Tom Burman are not up to the standards of his work on Philip Kauffman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) or Paul Schrader's remake of Cat People (1982) and at times look distinctly fake and rubbery.Now forget all my previously negative comments and go rent or buy this film immediately. Prophecy is the kind of z-grade, messy, misguided, big-studio trash that is so bad its simply quite brilliant. On the positive side, the film does build nicely towards its climax, wringing quite a few moments of suspense along the way. This isn't the Frankenheimer of The Manchurian Candidate (1962) or Seconds (1966) but Prophecy, though not an entirely successful synthesis of its themes and ideas, is a joy to behold.</p>
