<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Divers Brad and Tony arrive in Jamaica to attempt salvage of the "Lady Luck," sunk with all hands and a million in gold. They charter a boat, "American Beauty," skippered by attractive Terry McBride, but cannot find the ship. But there's more to the "Lady Luck" than meets the eye, and undersea skullduggery forms a counterpoint to Brad's romance with Terry, and Tony's with cabaret singer Venita.</p>
<p>Deep-sea divers Brad Carlton and Tony Bartlett are hired by Dwight Trevor to locate $1,000,000 in gold bullion sunk with the ship "Lady Luck." But, there's no trace of the ship because of a scheme between Trevor and the supposedly-missing captain of the ship. The "Lady Luck" is actually amid the ruins of a submerged city. Following and underseas earthquake, some menacing voodoo drums, and a whole lot of scheming and counter-scheming, the villains are disposed with, and the heroes get the girls.</p>
<p>Two American divers are distracted by fair ladies and skulduggery while trying to salvage a gold ship off Jamaica.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>City Beneath the Sea came on BBC2 one Saturday afternoon some years ago and I was pleased I taped it. This has never been released on video so I was glad I kept this TV copy.Two divers come to Jamaca to recover some gold on a sunken ship off the coast. One evening, they visit a club and meet two girls and both subsequently fall in love with them. Rivalry then breaks out between the two men over who will keep the gold when retrieved. The ship sunk near the ruins of an underwater city (not Atlantis) and the locals are against the men recovering the gold because the city is one of their tabu's. Not surprisingly, danger looms when the city collapses as a result of an undersea earthquake, trapping one of the divers. He is rescued by his mate and neither of them get the gold in the end.Despite being a bow budget movie, the underwater scenes in City Beneath the Sea are not that bad.The cast includes Robert Ryan and Anthony Quinn as the divers and Mala Powers and Susan Ball as the love interests. This also stars George Mathews and Woody Strode.Watching this movie is a good way to spend just under 90 minutes one afternoon or evening. Very enjoyable.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</p>
