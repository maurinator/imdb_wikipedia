<h1>Hilda Crane (1956)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is nothing to commend this poor excuse for a film. They call it a movie, but it is even worse than a stage play. It comes nowhere near the quality of 'Footsteps in the Fog', and obviously Jean Simmons lends her name to this project so that it can sell. None of the characters are sympathetic. They are all one-dimensional, and the story itself is unengaging. It is typical of certain studio films in the 1950s which were poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed.I would advise all Simmons fans to stay away from this film as it adds nothing to her canon of work, nor will you miss anything but not seeing it.</p>
