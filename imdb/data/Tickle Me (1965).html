<h1>Tickle Me (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Elvis is a singing rodeo rider who drifts into an expensive dude ranch patronized by wealthy glamour girls. The owner, Vera Radford, hires Elvis as a stable man. Pretty physical fitness trainer Pam Merritt has a letter from her late grandfather directing her to a cache of gold in the ghost town of Silverado. The sheriff and his gang learn of the letter and plot to take it away from her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While not receiving the same fanfare as some of Elvis' more renowned movies including Viva Las Vegas or Fun in Acapulco, this film is really very underrated and underscores the essence of Elvis flicks.  Perhaps because Elvis is not cavorting with a well known star, such as Ann Margaret or Ursula Andress as in the aforementioned vehicles, this picture tends to always get underplayed.  Most memorable is the ravishing English star, Ms. Jocelyn Lane, who absolutely lights up the scenery whenever she is around - what a stunner!</p>
