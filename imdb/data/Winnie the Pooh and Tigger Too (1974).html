<h1>Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rabbit is tired of Tigger always bouncing him, so he gets Pooh and Piglet together to come up with an idea to get the bounce out of Tigger. Rabbit suggests they take him into the middle of nowhere and leave him overnight. The idea backfires and Rabbit, Piglet and Pooh find themselves lost, but Pooh's tummy guides them home. Then, Tigger and Roo go out for a bounce and get caught in a tree, which Tigger is too afraid to get out of, and Rabbit makes Tigger promise that if they help get Tigger down, that Tigger can never bounce again. So Tigger is rescued and feels sad that he can no longer bounce, but everyone, including Rabbit, agrees they liked the old bouncy Tigger better.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have watched and reviewed a ton of Academy Award nominated animated shorts and this is a rare situation where I saw two films in this category in the same year that I think earned a 10--one of which was this wonderful film from Disney. The other, CLOSED MONDAYS, I loved because of its amazingly cranky main character and the uniqueness (at the time) of Claymation. Both are great and worth seeing, though I can't help but prefer WINNIE THE POOH AND TIGGER TOO!--it just had a timeless magical quality about it.However, I can certainly understand the Oscar people not giving this Pooh film an Oscar--after all, in 1969, WINNIE THE POOH AND THE BLUSTERY DAY earned the award in this category, so it wasn't like this Tigger film was super-unique--which CLOSED MONDAYS certainly was.As for this film, it is available now in a DVD with several other early Pooh shorts and is a must-have for fans of Pooh. It is simply perfect--charming and expertly crafted--with some of the best Disney animation you'll ever see.</p>
