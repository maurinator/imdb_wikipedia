<h1>The Parallax View (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joe Frady is a determined reporter who often needs to defend his work from colleagues. After the assassination of a prominent U.S. senator, Frady begins to notice that reporters present during the assassination are dying mysteriously. After getting more involved in the case, Frady begins to realize that the assassination was part of a conspiracy somehow involving the Parallax Corporation, an enigmatic training institute. He then decides to enroll for the Parallax training himself to discover the truth.</p>
<p>The official line: Senator Charles Carroll was assassinated by a lone gunman who also died at the scene, with no larger conspiracy involved in the assassination. Case closed. In the several following years after the assassination, six direct witnesses of the assassination - those that were featured in a published photograph - have themselves died, nothing seemingly tying these deaths together beyond the earlier event or deemed to be mysterious by authorities. However those four still surviving witnesses shown in the photograph, including television news reporter Lee Carter and Carroll's political advisor Austin Tucker, fear for their lives. Carter's newspaper investigative reporter colleague and former lover, Joe Frady, who was also at the event when the senator was assassinated, does not believe the conspiracy theory that Carter fears. Frady changes his opinion when more witness deaths occur. Frady, who has a history of irresponsibility in both his personal and professional life, decides to investigate. As he gets further into his investigative work, he does begin to think that the conspiracy theorists were correct, but that the conspiracy is much larger than even he could have imagined. Frady decides to go undercover, but there is race between Frady discovering the truth and the possible perpetrators discovering who Frady really is.</p>
<p>An ambitious reporter gets in way-over-his-head trouble while investigating a senator's assassination which leads to a vast conspiracy involving a multinational corporation behind every event in the world's headlines.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The late Alan J. Pakula's 1974 film about political murders is a superbly crafted thriller that holds the audience in its quiet, unsettling grip.Warren Beatty gives his character of Joe Frady, a "third-rate" journalist, just the right balance of recklessness and determination to enable one to have faith in this man to uncover such shady, potentially threatening goings-on.Beatty is ably backed up by the supporting cast, most notably Hume Cronyn as Frady's editor, and Paula Prentiss and William Daniels as, respectively, a television reporter and columnist both in fear for their lives.Composer Michael Small's main theme (used at strategic points throughout the film and often playing on the traditional patriotic sound of the trumpet) has a quality both mournful and despairing that relates effectively to what we are watching. It is a rather sparse music score, but this seems to add to its power. Gordon Willis's Panavision photography conveys threat in even the most everyday of locations (his rendering of modern architecture is especially strong in suggesting a faceless, omnipotent threat), while the editing rhythms and sound design contribute a great deal in throwing the audience off-balance.Pakula has been involved in more widely-known projects such as All The President's Men and Presumed Innocent, but The Parallax View is definitely one of his best and most powerful films.</p>
