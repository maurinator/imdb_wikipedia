<h1>Bulletproof (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of dangerous terrorists succeeds to get hold of a tank of the army and all its crew.</p>
<p>Frank McBain is a big city cop with a habit of surviving getting shot in the line of duty over a dozen times. He earns the moniker "Bulletproof". When a super-secret ultra-comfortable prototype Tank is hijacked by Guerillas on the Mexican border, McBain is sent by the government to retrieve it. Not only does his girlfriend happen to be the commander in charge of the mission, but the terrorists turn out to be a multi-national invasion force with Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Cubans, Libyans, and Soviets all teamed up to destroy America with the help of their new tank.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had such high hopes for this movie when I discovered it. Not only does it star my favorite actor of all time (Henry Silva), but it serves as the vehicle for Gary Busey's ill-fated and misguided debut as an action star! Unfortunately, I was pretty let down by the time the end credits rolled. The only redeeming aspect of this dated movie is the first half-hour, which is a pathetic attempt to mimic Lethal Weapon-styled buddy cop movies. Like many other action flicks starring big ego second-tier stars (Steven Seagal being our number one offender here), they really try to build up the main character as a devil-may-care indestructible ex-CIA supercop who all the bad guys know about. Notice during the ice cream truck chase when the villains have this exchange after they pound Busey's car with bullets:Villain 1: I think we blew him off! Villain 2: You don't blow up a dude like McBain!The story is pretty lame once it gets going. McBain is hired by the army to retrieve a tank named "Thunderblast" (!) that seems to be some armored afterbirth of the Reagan-era military buildup. Henry Silva's role is pretty wasted as a Libyan colonel who is working alongside the Commies. Aside from the hilariously bad first half hour and the introduction of the word "butthorn" into popular lexicon, Bulletproof is pretty much a waste of time.</p>
