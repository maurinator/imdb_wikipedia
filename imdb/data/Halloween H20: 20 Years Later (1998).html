<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Besides Halloween II, no other movie in the franchise hit the chilling shivery atmosphere like Halloween H20. This feeling first sinks in when the opening scenes follow Nancy Stephens who plays Nurse Marion Chambers from the first two movies. Jamie Lee Curtis is also back along with a solid cast around her such as Josh Hartnett and LL Cool J, which really makes the film quality. The direction and dialog was weak in a few spots but the scenes are never bland. H20 also might have the best Myers mask in the franchise and the actor did a great job portraying him to be cold and calculated. It's too bad that this Halloween H20 wasn't the last of the franchise because the ending would have been amazingly perfect but sadly the only real way to kill Michael Myers is by the box office numbers.</p>
