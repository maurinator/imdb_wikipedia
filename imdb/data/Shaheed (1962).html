<h1>Shaheed (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A lone foreigner arrives in Saudi Arabia and treated with generosity and hospitality by the Arab tribals. But the guy (named Lawrence) has insidious motives. He has his eyes on the oil deposits deep under the Arab territories, which the Arab chieftain opposes vehemently. With cunning and duplicity he manages to overthrow the chieftain, and gets his way with the blessings of the incumbent ruler. He sets up an oil drill and refinery, and exports the oil to foreign countries while paying a token amount of cash to the Arab ruler. He also colludes with the local Jews and uses a popular cabaret dancer named Laila to get her followers and fans hooked on opium. But an Arab blacksmith named Haris has been on to Lawrence, and plans a resistance with the exiled former chieftain.</p>
