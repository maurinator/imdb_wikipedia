<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I understand what Schumacher tried to do with this movie...it seems like a giant comic book, but...oh, hell...the movie is horrible.  I don't think I've seen such bad performances in my entire life.  I wasn't only disappointed by this movie, but mildly insulted that something like this was supposed to be a blockbuster at one point;  yeah guys, maybe if we were all five.  Whatever happened to the original Batman?  Michael Keaton and Kim Bassinger?  Yeah, see, back in the good old days, good comic book adaptation movies were made.  Batman and Robin is TO BE AVOIDED LIKE THE PLAGUE</p>
