<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>No need to recap the plot, which at the beginning resembles that of Giant (1956). Musicals generally live or die by the quality of the music. By that standard, this one is pretty much a snoozer following a string of forgettably bland numbers, which at least don't annoy.The movie itself stands as a clear instance of lead performers outshining the materialÂ— mainly, the always sparkling Jane Powell and a fabulous Danielle Darrieux. Even the seemingly miscast Corey, so usually dour, manages an agreeable father. While in a tacked-on role, a hunky Fernando Lamas is clearly on his way up. One can sympathize, however, with boyish crooner Damone in his first film-- his self-consciousness almost flies off the screen.I expect critics are right about the problems caused by Powell's pregnancy. The production has a less polished, more constrained look than the usual high MGM standard. This could well be due to a hurry-up schedule and Powell's growing girth. Whatever the reason, the movie's a chance to catch the ravishing French actress Darrieux in one of her few American roles. Otherwise, it's pretty forgettable.</p>
