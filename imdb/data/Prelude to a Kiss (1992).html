<h1>Prelude to a Kiss (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A couple fall in love despite the girl's pessimistic outlook. As they struggle to come to terms with their relationship, something supernatural happens that tests it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Craig Lucas adapted his own hit play about a nervous newlywed (Meg Ryan) inadvertently exchanging souls just after the wedding ceremony with a lonely, elderly man via a magical smooch. Lucas works hard trying to keep his script free from the often-tread "body switching movie" genre, but he has nothing else to fall back on. Bridegroom Alec Baldwin (who also played this part on stage) fidgets about trying to do something other than look confused, and Meg Ryan (after the switch) is stuck doing even less. The old-fashioned handling by director Norman Ren√© is too-cute--and though Baldwin and Ryan are a nice screen match, this premise never allows that union to become important to us. *1/2 from ****</p>
