<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautifully filmed in Death Valley, a low budget didn't hurt this fine movie, which was crafted with intelligence, wit, and imagination.  Paul Mantee stars as the survivor of an ill-fated voyage to Mars, and he plays his role with zest, humor, and gritty determination to survive despite the long odds against him.Nicely adapted from the classic tale, this movie stands the test of time; despite its being released in 1964, it has a uniquely authentic look and feel, despite the dated hardware.It's a good movie for the kids (they'll probably fall in love with Mona the monkey). Best of all, this movie leaves you with a satisfied, thumbs-up smile when the ending credits roll, and lots of movies with bigger stars and more lavish budgets just don't do as well.I rate it 8.5 out of 10</p>
