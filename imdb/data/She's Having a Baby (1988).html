<h1>She's Having a Baby (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jake and Kristy Briggs are newlyweds. Being young, they are perhaps a bit unprepared for the full reality of marriage and all that it (and their parents) expect from them. Do they want babies? Their parents certainly want them to. Is married life all that there is? Things certainly aren't helped by Jake's friend Davis, who always seems to turn up just in time to put a spanner in the works.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>SHE'S HAVING A BABY (1988) *** Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Mc Govern, Alec Baldwin, William Windom, Cathryn Damon, John Ashton, Edie McClurg, Dennis Dugan.  Frequently accurate domestic comedy about newlyweds Bacon and McGovern who finally decide to procreate amidst the usual barriers including family and money.  Smart script and direction by John Hughes with a sharp turn of events by the film's climax with an effectively dramatic birth sequence; I got misty eyed for Bacon and the plight of his newborn accentuated by the song "This Woman's Work" by Kate Bush.  Wait for the credits with some celebrities coming up with names for the baby.</p>
