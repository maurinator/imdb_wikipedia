<h1>A Delicate Balance (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Connecticut, Agnes and Tobias are an upper-class married couple whose relationship has been uneasy for many years, since at least the time their son died; but they've managed to find a certain comfortable pattern of uneasiness. Agnes's sister, Claire, lives with them and insists that her perpetual drinking is not alcoholism but willfulness. Their daughter, Julia, poised to have her fourth divorce, has come back home. Unexpectedly, her room has been taken over by Harry and Edna, best friends of Tobias and Agnes. Seized by a nameless terror that propelled them out of their own house, Harry and Edna have decided to stay.</p>
<p>The setting is the comfortable Connecticut home of a well-to-do family. Agnes is a determined, powerful woman who feels she must hold her husband together and present a brave face to the world. Her husband, Tobias, is both retired and retiring, a man who cannot quite face up to life. Living with the couple is Agnes' sister, Claire, an alcoholic who sees through and scoffs at the insincerity and pretensions around her. Clare's outrageous comments are meant as much to reflect her own bitterness as to shake Tobias out of his mute acceptance of Agnes' dominance. They are soon joined by Harry and Edna, a married couple who are Agnes and Tobias' best friends and Agnes and Tobias' spoiled 36-year old daughter, Julia, who returns home from her fourth broken marriage.</p>
<p>A well-to-do Connecticut family is upended when the grown daughter's godparents, seized by a nameless terror, decide they've come to live with them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a huge fan of Albee's `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' and that time in cinema known as the 70's when Hollywood temporarily forgot it was a business and attempted to make films that were about something, I approached AFT's `A Delicate Balance' with no little anticipation.Sitting through this lengthy talk-fest of suburban WASPs initially proved unsatisfying. Drawn to something, I found myself unable to turn off the DVD, but wondered if it was merely a hope that `something' was going to happen to explain why these people assembled resembled no human beings I'd ever encountered.Once the film ended, I resigned myself to having endured an inferior Albee production, puzzled by its reputation. Yet somehow my first impression struck me as false. I mean, I had to admit I loved the performances and there was something about the suburban milieu, that atmosphere of `Ordinary People,' that was intriguing enough to keep me watching, yet still left me cold.I watched the film again, and like a pianist who learns to play the music after forgetting about the technique of the notes, I discovered a gripping, bitingly funny and achingly honest look into the fear of aging, the obligations of love, and the price paid for order instead of the messy spontaneity of actually living.  The language of `A Delicate Balance' is both its blessing and its curse. It's distancing in its theatricality, but BOY what those words convey! The performances too suffer the dual burden of being rich characterizations of people you'd hate to spend an evening with.I found the film to be like a great work of literature; its riches aren't laid out easily on the surface for one to grasp, but if you take the time, it can be the most rewarding of experiences. Excellent if not exactly accessible.</p>
