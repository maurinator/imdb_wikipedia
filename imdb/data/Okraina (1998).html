<h1>Okraina (1998)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a very hard movie,and I didn't really find any funny moments-it might be a very peculiar kind of humor which I really don't get.What can I say about Okraina?A very strange movie,somewhere a mix between Tarkovski(the overall mud),Tarantino(the fun of having someone's blood on its clothes),Kurosawa(the gang of men looking for justice),to say nothing about Dziga Vertov,Eisenstein in the expressionistic language.Despite this strange mixture,the movie remains a highly original,and illuminating in understanding why Bakunin,Stalin,the Ukrainian murderers in the Holocaust could exist.It is a movie who needs open-minded,and patient audience.What stunned me-it might be ironic,I hope,it's the collectivist happy end.So,if you love Tarantino,find Tarkovski breathtaking and have nihilistic thoughts,you will like.Others,try it,it might be alright.</p>
