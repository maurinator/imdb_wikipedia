<h1>A Man Called Sarge (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the midst of WWII, a group of half-witted soldiers led by a slightly smarter sergeant, battle the Germans and especially Von Kraut in the desert.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the most wonderful comedy I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot. The humor of this movie defines exactly my kind of humor. From the strange remarks of the persons in the movie to the ridiculous comments of the narrator it makes me roll on the floor laughing. It's been about 7 years since I saw it last. So now I'm looking for it on VHS (preferably PAL). Where do I find it on sale? Can anyone guide me in the right direction? If you ever come across it I can only recommend that you see it. Watch any false teeth when you laugh.</p>
