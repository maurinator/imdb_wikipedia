<h1>Hiawatha (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hiawatha, a member of the Ojibway tribe, is on a peace mission to the Dakotah tribe. He meets and falls in love with Minniehaha. The romance is obstructed by a threatened war between the two tribes, instigated by a hot-headed Ojibway tribe member. The war is averted and Hiawatha learns that he is actually the long-missing son of the Dakotah chief. Hiawatha and Minniehaha set up tent-keeping together.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1952 low budget film is one of the few attempts to depict Native American life before European interference. It is a realistic portrayal of the legend of Hiawatha, loosely based on the Longfellow poem, leaving out the supernatural elements. As such, it is moderately successful. A much depilated Vincent Edwards in the lead role tries hard, but he is a bit of a wooden Indian, thoroughly upstaged by the much more interesting warmonger Popokeewis, his bitter enemy (Keith Larsen). John Ericson played Hiawatha 6 yrs. later in the Shirley Temple Storybook TV production with the fantasy elements very much in play. Film buffs interested in Native American life should see this modest piece, it is a sincere effort, though it's put in the shade by such later films as the splendid 1980 "Windwalker."</p>
