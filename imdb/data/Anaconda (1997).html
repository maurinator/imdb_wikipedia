<h1>Anaconda (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a documentary crew traveling through the Amazon jungle, picks up a stranded man, they are unaware of the trouble that will occur. This stranger's hobby is to capture the giant Anaconda snake, and plans to continue targeting it on their boat, by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Sent on a National Geographic survey of the jungle to capture the largest anaconda, a group of cardboard cutouts posing as actors bite off more than they can chew and get chewed up by an over sized and very agitated snake. That sums up the film. What looks like it may be a turkey is saved by a CGI snake upstaging all the actors and devouring them. Unfortunately J-Lo survives since she would be too glamorous to be devoured and she would have made the snake look tame by comparison by throwing a hissy fit if she was to be eaten. The perfect Saturday night film showing that not all films need to aspire to Citizen Kane and fun for the sake of it is an art form in itself</p>
<p>A film crew headed by anthropologist Steve Cale and director Terri Flores journey through a river to find a mysterious Indian tribe and shoot a documentary on them. They save a guy called Paul Sarone from a sinking boat. He offers to help in their search for the tribe, but he is actually a snake-hunter looking for legendary anaconda snake, and when Cale is bitten by some tropical insect, Sarone takes over the boat.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'Anaconda' (1997) is headlined by a brilliant cast that wouldn't normally be collected for a production of this quality/genre (kudos to the casting crew!). However, its the Anaconda that's supposed to be the real star here. Unfortunately, the snake's CGI isn't quite up to the par of the passable animatronics, so its rarely able to pass itself off as believable, but the remainder of the cinematography is rich & luscious. Additionally, the plot/premise are let down by an loose & inconsistent script, mediocre editing (continuity errors galore!), & direction that could have gotten more out of this cast/production; 'Anaconda' however, still views as thoroughly enjoyable entertainment with great (if not campy) acting, & somewhat thrilling adventure & suspenseful action. Although the level of cast says otherwise, this is no Academy/AFI experience. Instead, what you view here, is your better than average light horror, thriller, action, adventure film that is perfect for a home matin√©e on the weekend, or an intimate midnight view on a dark & rainy night. 'Anaconda' is therefore recommended for light monster/horror genre fans & for the casual horror/thriller genre enthusiast. For similar themes consider watching: 'Alligator' (1980); 'Python' (2000); 'Anaconda (2): The Hunt for the Blood Orchid' (2004); 'Lake Placid' (1999); & 'Komodo' (2000). Also consider: 'Crocodile' (2000); 'Crocodile 2' (2001); 'Python' (2000); 'Venomous' (2001); 'Boa' (2002); 'Congo' (1995); 'The Relic' (1997); 'Mimic' (1997); Snake Woman' (2005); 'Boa vs. Python' (2004); & 'Snake Island' (2002).</p>
