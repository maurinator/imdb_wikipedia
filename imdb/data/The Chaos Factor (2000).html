<h1>The Chaos Factor (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An American army intelligence officer discovers corruption and murder by American soldiers in Vietnam.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A total waste of time, car chase after car chase and unbelievable situations. This is a bummer. I gave it a 1 only because I could not give it a 0. In a class with Executive Power. I wish reviews were more honest. Fred Ward is growing old and Antonio Sabato, Jr. needs better material. What a waste of time.</p>
