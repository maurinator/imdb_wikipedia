<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this movie i went and saw when it first came out.  After watching the behind the scenes promos on nickelodeon i was really shocked that Nickelodeon can do movies as well as a television network.  Brilliantly written and acted i loved the acting and all the characters.  It shows that what you are thinking is not always good to write down for fear of someone finding it.  It also show's her trials and tribulations going through 6th grade wanting to be a spy and having a nanny in the mix.  I loved Rosie O' Donnell in this film she is truly an awesome actor and during the movie you can't help but get a little teary eyed and crack up when your supposed to.  I recommend for anyone especially a movie night for the family and/or friends! ~!</p>
