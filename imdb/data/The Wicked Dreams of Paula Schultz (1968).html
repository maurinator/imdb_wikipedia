<h1>The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A beautiful East German Olympic hopeful pole-vaults over the Berlin Wall to freedom.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The idea of using the Hogan's Heroes cast in a cold war farce could have been delicious.  The Paula Schultz character, her circumstances, and goals, could have made for a very interesting cold war farce.  Bob Crane, stepping out of character, to form a complex blend of con man, sadist, and American patriot, had definite possibilities.  Unfortunately, when they put them all together.  This is the mess they got.  I can hardly believe that George Marshall (!!!) is the credited director on this disjointed, slapsticky, murky mess.</p>
