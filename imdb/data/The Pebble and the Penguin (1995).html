<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this animation as I collect penguins and there were some cute pictures with a _little_ factual information in the story, but the dialog and songs did not live up to the high standard of classic Disney films.  The little plot seemed too simplistic and obviously going to end happily-ever-after. There was none of the suspense caused by a good score and life-or-death situations with last minute saves which  characterize good fairytales.Overall: 5/10 - passes the time, just</p>
