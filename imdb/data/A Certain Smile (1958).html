<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here's a film that's boosted by its spectacular scenic splendor and a lovely title tune, A CERTAIN SMILE, sung by Johnny Mathis and immediately becoming one of his favorite hit tunes, which is about the only thing that will linger in your memory once the tawdry tale is over.The simple story is a trifle (as all of Francoise Sagan's novels are), dealing as it does with the subject of flirtation and affairs. The affair is between a pretty young law student studying at the Sorbonne, CHRISTINE CARRERE, and ROSSANO BRAZZI, her Uncle Luc who is married to the sophisticated JOAN FONTAINE. Christine is also being pursued by a fellow law student, BRADFORD DILLMAN, but seems to prefer Brazzi's continental charm to callow youth.Most of the trite story centers on the budding romance between Brazzi and Carrere, leaving Fontaine on the sidelines wondering what the glances between the two really mean. Does it really matter? She gazes with sophisticated charm at Johnny Mathis as he sings "A Certain Smile", all the while knowing that her husband is a philanderer.It really has nothing new to say, but can be enjoyed on the basis of its CinemaScope grandeur and the performances of the leads, all of whom have done better work elsewhere and are pretty much wasted here.</p>
