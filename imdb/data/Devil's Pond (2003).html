<h1>Devil's Pond (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>What starts out as a romantic honeymoon on a deserted island turns into a horrible nightmare as Julianne discovers that her new husband is psychotic. Trapped on the island, he has no plans of ever returning to civilization, or even of letting her go. She slowly realizes that only one of them may ever leave the island.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked this movie. I thought that it was something different and realistic. It goes to show that sometimes you never really know someone. The only thing that was unrealistic was the fact when he came back from the truck with a lit cigarette and the gun dry. That would never have happened.I liked how Julianne fought for herself. She became sneaky about her tactics and overcame fears. She wasn't willing to give up. I also liked how she found out that he had stalked her before they ended up together. It really brought everything into perspective. It really shows that no matter how much you know a person, sometimes there are things about them that you never thought possible.</p>
