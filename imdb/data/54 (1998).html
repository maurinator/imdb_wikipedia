<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Studio 54 was a swift, colourful flick that showed us the true ins and outs of the seventies.  The only difference is that the writers remembered the seventies .. thus, they obviously didn't really live the seventies atmosphere to its fullest. Mr Ryan Phillippe, in my opinion, took on an enormous task in performing this role ... I mean who else could you get to wear tight clothing, push pills, make drinks, take sexual harassment from a male employer, and still look pretty?  Ms Campbell' purpose in this movie showed young girls that you can get somewhere with talent and not just looks.  Basically, the script was compelling, the acting was sought as half way and ended up getting three quarters ... so overall I say that this isn't that bad of a flick if you are looking for something out of the everyday norm.  I gave this movie a rating of a "9" because it is a personal favourite of mine, and the casting was one of the best combos, for my taste in movies.  - David Wills christian 11/01/99</p>
