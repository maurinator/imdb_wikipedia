<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, I did not have huge expectations from Ghatak, but it worked for me on several levels, although the overall product is not particularly impressive. Rajkumar Santoshi is one director who has done some very good films, my favourite being Damini, Lajja and The Legend of Bhagat Singh, but this one is a mixed bag. The movie has good and bad points, but it is quite uneven and works mostly in parts. It started off very well, and looked rather promising especially because of the father-son relationship, which was beautifully portrayed. Sunny Deol is the devoted son, Amrish Puri is the kind, idealistic and caring father who suffers from cancer and yet never lets the nearing death deter him. Even the romantic scenes, which are given minimal screen time, are simple and pleasant. One of the best scenes in the film is the one in which Sunny is told of his father's state and lack of chances to survive. The subsequent interaction between the father and son when the latter tries to contain himself but finally breaks down, is so real and emotional that it really tags at the heartstrings. But then we also get a typical Hindi film villain in the form of Danny Denzongpa, and what initially looked like a touching drama about family struggle gradually transforms into a messy, painfully loud and over-the-top action flick. Too bad the story took such a drastic turn because rarely do we get to see films about relationships in families, and while it is according to me one of the best things about this film, it is totally sidelined by the end of the show. There was one particular scene when the villain humiliates the father but unfortunately it looks embarrassing and unintentionally funny. The movie does try to bring about some substance, like the moment when the father convinces the son to use his brain rather than his strength. This is a novel concept, but it is eventually poorly executed, lacking depth and relying on too much melodrama, ultimately failing to convey the planned message. In the middle we also get some unnecessary sub-plots including the disclosure of the leading lady's true identity. I cannot think of a more clich√©d and banal way to ruin a film.The film's acting wavers between good, average and bad, and the problem is that so do the performances. Sunny Deol does really well in some scenes, particularly those showing his deep care for his father and his huge grief upon finding out about the latter's health conditions. But then the film lets him down by turning him into a typical hero of sorts. Danny Denzongpa as the villain is pretty bad. Meenakshi Shshadri gets little scope and although Santoshi tries to emphasise her role by giving it a story of its own, one would expect to see a better role to complete her career. She looks beautiful and dances very well though, but it was expected. The only one who is consistently great is Amrish Puri who steals the show with his excellent performance. Whether he is a loving father, an idealistic man of high moral principles, or a cancer patient who does not let his illness take over his positivity and optimism, he is throughly convincing, heartfelt and moving. I still give Ghatak some credit for some of its high-points, Amrish Puri's performance, and Sunny Deol's one to an extent.</p>
