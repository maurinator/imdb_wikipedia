<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film when i was about 13 and it had a huge impact on me. Everything comes together so well to produce a stunning overall effect. The animation is unique and uses many contrasting styles from soft, cartoony character design to harsh, powerful and sometimes disturbing imagery reminiscent of some of Gerald Scarfe's work in 'The Wall'. The soundtrack is also superb and subtely integrated into the storyline, using both instrumental and vocal tracks from David Bowie, Roger Waters and Genesis.As you watch the film you are given a 'fly-on-the-wall' perspective of an elderly couple 'preparing' for a nuclear blast. Their innocence and naivety is moving whilst at the same time full of hope. They dutifully follow governmental leaflets firmly believing that the powers that be will never let them down. This viewpoint is harrowing for the viewer as we know that there is no real hope for either of them and yet still they carry on even after the blast, with a quiet dignity and bravery which is very endearing.This is not a film with a happy ending and nor should it be. For this reason some may call it depressing but the media of film should not always be used to merely entertain.There are few films out there that truly have the power to make an impact on us that will last the rest of our lives, thankfully When The Wind Blows is one of them. A daring and innovative movie which is so much more than just a cartoon.It is also now available at last on DVD. I intend to order my copy very soon. Highly recommended.</p>
