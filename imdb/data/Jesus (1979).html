<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I always like it when Hollywood tries to make a film with a positive mesasge about religion in it. Sunn Classic made this documentary about Christs life and death and the mystery of the Holy Shroud. It is very well done and acted and very respectful in terms of how it depicts our savior. They re-enact his journeys, healings and crucifixion. Brad Crandall was a great nararator with a wonderful storyteller voice. He made Sunn Classic Pictures come alive the way that Leonard Nimoy made In Search Of... or Robert Stack makes Unsolved Mysteries come alive. About nine years after this film came out however, there were scientific tests done on the Shroud that seemed to prove it was nothing but a medievil forgery.</p>
