<h1>Grease 2 (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Return to rockin' Rydell High for a whole new term! It's 1961, two years after the original Grease gang graduated, and there's a new crop of seniors - and new members of the coolest cliques on campus, the Pink Ladies and T-Birds. Michael Carrington is the new kid in school - but he's been branded a brainiac. Can he fix up an old motorcycle, don a leather jacket, avoid a rumble with the leader of the T-Birds, and win the heart of Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone? He's surely going to try!</p>
<p>An English student at a 1960's American high school has to prove himself to the leader of a girls' gang whose members can only date greasers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film to me is not that bad, most the people who have seen it compare it to the original. What I reckon is that if this was just a film and not a sequel to Grease it would probably be appreciated more.In my opinion I like Grease 2 better, I actually found Grease to be quite boring, but hey that's just me. In Grease 2 I like the songs better and the guys are much more better looking than the first one.Overall this movie for me is quite entertaining and I like it, and I certainly do not compare it to the first one as it is a whole new different movie and storyline.So if you haven't seen Grease 2 before because people say it's crap and that it's a waste of time, at least give it a chance and watch it, it might surprise you.</p>
