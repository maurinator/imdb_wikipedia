<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not one for comic books. The comic book lore for a lot of characters is still rather foreign to me, but I'm always open for some DC animation so I gave this a try. I thankfully came out of this liking it although I think there's some flaws to it.Good: I like the storyline overall with Damian and Batman working together as father and son. I like the moral dilemmas brought on with Damian. There are some great action sequences in here especially the one in the beginning and its surprisingly violent. The voice work is good also.Bad: Damian at first got on my nerves as he came off as a brat, but that was the point so I can let it slide. However, I think the movie is fine, but I think could benefit with a longer runtime and a bigger budget. The lack of emphasis on the villains and the rushed setup hurts the momentum and with enough resources it could have been something great.Overall, it's not one of the best Batman animated films, but it's entertaining enough and worthy of a rental.</p>
