<h2> Summaries </h2>

Through a baggage mix-up at the airport, grumpy old Mrs.Hess gets the toy and gives it to her neighbor, 8-year-old Alex. Spies want to get the toy back before their clients get angry and decide to burglarize every house at Alex's street to find the chip. But Alex is prepared for their visit...</p>
<p>Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger, after stealing a top secret computer chip hide the chip in a remote control car. After going through security at San Francisco International Airport, they grab Mrs. Hess's bag off the X-ray belt while Mrs. Hess grabs the bag containing the toy car. They then see that a flight to Chicago is showing "now boarding" on the monitors showing all the flights, so they decide to board that flight. When in Chicago the crooks ask the cab driver who drove Mrs. Hess home where her house is, and for a description, and the cab driver says that her house is the only house whose driveway was not shoveled. At Mrs. Hess's house that night, Alex Pruitt shovels snow on Mrs. Hess's driveway, and he gets the toy car as a thank-you gift. The crooks get there to see that every driveway has been shoveled. The next day, Alex, who is home sick from school, spots the crooks in one of the neighbors' houses, so he calls the police to report the burglary. By the time the police get there, the crooks are gone, and no tracks that anyone broke into the house are left. Therefore, Alex is accused of turning in a false police report. The next day the crooks are spotted in Mrs. Hess's house, so Alex calls the police again. Once again, the police find no evidence that the house was broken into, so the chief comes to speak to Alex about how serious it is to call the police. The next day, the burglars are spotted again, but this time Alex decides to attach the camcorder to the top of the toy car, and attempt to get footage of the burglars in action. After a fight with the burglars to gain the toy car, Alex sees that they took the tape, and he finds the chip hidden inside the car. He then reports the chip to the local Air Force recruiting office, who informs the FBI. The burglars, figuring that Alex has the car, approach the Pruitts' house, only to find booby traps. In the end, an FBI agent comes to the house, and Alex hands the chip to the FBI agent, and the crooks are all caught.</p>
<p>Peter Beaupre is the leader of a group of thieves who have stolen a valuable Air Force computer chip. When a bag mixup at the O'Hare Airport in Chicago causes Mrs. Hess, a grouchy old lady, to unknowingly take home the chip hidden inside of a toy remote control car, Beaupre and his followers Alice Ribbons, Earl Unger, and Burton Jernigan begin searching Mrs. Hess's neighborhood and breaking into houses searching for the chip. 8-year-old Alex Pruitt reports seeing Beaupre and his followers, but Alex's sister Molly, his brother Stan, and his parents Jack and Karen refuse to believe him. Beaupre and his followers figure out that the chip is in the Pruitt home, because Mrs. Hess has given the remote control car to Alex. Alex is left home alone with the chicken pox when Karen goes to work, Jack goes out of town on a business trip, and Molly and Stan go to school. When Beaupre and his followers break into the Pruitt house, Alex is ready with some of the most painful booby traps Beaupre and his gang will ever face.</p>

Alex finds out about the chip in the car, and that terrorists are looking for it. So he sets up traps in his home when his house was their target.</p>
<p>Alex Pruitt, a young boy of nine living in Chicago, fend off thieves who seek a top-secret chip in his toy car to support a North Korean terrorist organization's next deed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While the story is once again written by John Hughes, the directorial duties are this time taken over by Raja Gosnell. While it's not an absolutely terrible movie, this sequel to the first two, hugely successful, films suffers from a few major problems.Problem one  no Macaulay Culkin. He may not be the best, or even cutest, kid actor in the world but Culkin was the undeniable star of the Home Alone movies and so setting up a story in which some other kid (young Alex, played by Alex D. Linz) has to stay at home on his own thanks to a case of the measles just isn't going to please those who wanted more of Culkin's antics.Problem two  no Daniel Stern or Joe Pesci. The baddies of the piece are a bunch of agents (three men and one woman) who are after a special chip that has been placed in a remote control car given to Alex by one of his neighbours. The actors all do fairly well with their roles but they're no match for the gut-busting physical comedy that Stern was able to showcase in the previous films.Problem three  it stretches believability, even for a Home Alone movie, in places and the complexity of some of the booby traps here make the kid look more like a new MacGyver than a new Macaulay.But for those not feeling overly precious about things and willing to give it a go, these problems can also be turned around and viewed as positive. At least with a different kid as the focus of the attention we don't have to try to believe that the same thing would keep happening again and again to little Kevin McCallister and Alex D. Linz is quite a likable little moppet so that also works in the film's favour.And while we're lacking "The Wet/Sticky Bandits" we at least get double the amount of victims trying to navigate their way through numerous, inventive booby-traps. Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny von Dohlen and David Thornton may have weaker material to work with but they still provide a good mix of menace and idiocy.The other big bonus for the movie is that, although it's inherently repetitive when compared to the concept of it's predecessors, it doesn't identically replicate moments as the second film did. This means that things feel familiar but also a little fresher this time around.The cast all do well enough and there's the lovely Haviland Morris playing Alex's mother while a very young Scarlett Johansson appears in the role of big sis, so completist fans may be interested in this for that reason alone.Director Gosnell doesn't do anything spectacular but he's far from incompetent and paces the film well while leading everyone towards that big, trap-laden finale that we all want to see. An easy film for fans of the first two to be harsh towards, this actually makes for mildly amusing family fun and I'm sure it would keep some kids happy on a dreary afternoon stuck indoors. Though it would never be a first choice.</p>
