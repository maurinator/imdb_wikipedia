<h1>End of the Game (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While investigating a high-profile murder case, a savvy but unorthodox veteran police inspector has to cope with a bad conscience, bad health, an overzealous partner, a timid superior and interference from political interests. This is an existential whodunit, but a good one, and like any good whodunit, ends with a very surprising conclusion, which will be spoiled for you if you read much of anything at all about the movie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Martin Ritt is absolutely spellbinding.  He embodies one of the most unforgettable men I have ever met on the screen.  It is a neat little thriller, and Shaw is fine as the would-be super-villain, but it is Ritt that still haunts my thoughts and dreams years after my three viewings of this film; I would love to get it on tape.</p>
