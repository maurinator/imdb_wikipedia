<p>A man, John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell), wakes up in the bath of his hotel room. He has no memory, not even of his name, and there is a dead prostitute in his hotel room. He then receives a phone call from Doctor Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), telling him that some people are coming for him and he should leave immediately. He flees, becoming the prime suspect in a series of murders of prostitutes. On the case is Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt). Bumstead is intrigued when Murdoch's wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly) reports Murdoch missing. Meanwhile, it is clear that some strange people with special powers are after Murdoch. Turns out he has these powers too...</p>
<p>John's life has become a nightmare. He is hunted by the police for a series of murders he knows nothing about, a woman who claims to be his wife is after him, and so is a mysterious "doctor". But his worst trouble is the strangers, a series of vastly powerful beings who seem to manipulate just about everything in the city, and want him because of the extraordinary powers he manifested. John decides to find out what is happening in his city; why is it always night? And why can nobody tell him a way to leave the city?</p>
<p>A man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>simply wonderful on every level. A matrix meets Truman show if you will. Remarkably the film works despite its weird. wonderful and uncomfortable story line. Genuinely disturbing, as interesting as any murder mystery and beautiful atmosphere with art deco, film noir, and night on elm street under belly.At first you will be tempted to draw comparisons with the matrix and at other times the mind wonders and the ghostly tall men enter our dreams, but as the film progresses the human heart begins to take centre stage particularly in the characters of the two police chiefs as well as the central figure of John Murdoch. All in all a cascading and multi-dimensional cinematic delight that left me feeling unsettled and warm at the same time.watch it.</p>
