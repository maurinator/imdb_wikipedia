<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Parts are slow, and parts are non-sequitirs that don't quite add up.  But the dialogues is marvelous, the acting terrific, and the suspense constant. Great bits by James Woods, Christopher Plummer, Stephen Hill, and Morgan Freeman add to the irony and the enjoymnent.  It's fun to watch William Hurt before he got so jaundiced.</p>
