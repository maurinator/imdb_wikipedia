<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>None of the characters in this film are the stereotypes you might expect, and a few of the performances are simply magnificent.  Patricia Clarkson in particular probably won't be an Oscar contender, but certainly should be. The two leads are also played to perfection, and I enjoyed the film far more than I had anticipated.  Definitely should not have been relegated to the art-house circuit.</p>
