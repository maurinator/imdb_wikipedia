<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Christopher Reeve had starred in some good thrillers when he wasn't flying around as Superman. This is a gripping thriller for him. Reeve plays a top detective Dempsey Cain who is paralyzed after a drugs operation. Thus, he resigns himself to life in a wheelchair but that is when things get going. Also, Dempsey's brother and wife have been having an affair and now that he is paralyzed, he may just notice what has been going on...I cannot say any more. The film has such twists that if I say anything more I will end up giving it away. I cannot even go into detail about Joe Mantegna's role without potentially spoiling it. I urge you to watch the movie and be prepared for a real twist. If you like thrillers that involve murder and adultery, then this is the one for you.This was Reeve's last film before he became paralyzed in the riding accident he had. This was one of those rare but disturbing occasions of life imitating art.</p>
