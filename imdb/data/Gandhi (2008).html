<h1>Gandhi (2008)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Written by Gandhi' uses brilliant quotes from Mahatma Gandhi counterpointed by a very simple visual style to explore the timeless theme of human conflict. Cartoon animation allows Gandhi's powerful message to be accessible to all ages, races and regions of the world, while the bare-knuckle narrative provides comic relief for a topic as heady as universal brotherhood.</p>
<p>The film is a hilarious and uplifting animated sixty second sprint toward world peace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film about a month or so ago. It's a charming film in a tiny package. The film runs for only a minute which is impressive considering the impression it left on me. The message it conveys imparts a valuable lesson in which we can all benefit to learn. The animation is pleasantly and appropriately designed; it's simplicity creates an endearing motif. Many films tend to have overly flashy animation that can actually distract the viewer form the film's content but this is not one of those films. I especially enjoyed Anna Halldorsdottir's music. I found it to have a very uniquely wholesome appeal that complimented the film's style. Kudos to Mr. Spaid for creating such a delightful little movie.</p>
