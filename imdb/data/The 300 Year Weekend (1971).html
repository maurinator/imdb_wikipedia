<h1>The 300 Year Weekend (1971)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This tv movie was very entertaining and daring. It nearly took place in real time, involving several people at an encounter group. It's full of detailed and involving characters. Had a documentary feel to it. There was one guy in the group who was constantly threatening people's lives. I've talked with guy who was at such a group, and that seemed plausible.</p>
