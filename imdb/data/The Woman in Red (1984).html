<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wilder's only film he directed in a contemporary setting is by far his most successful effort. His other films (most notably "The Adventure Of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother" 9/10) have had higher levels of zany gags in them, but here he has crafted a down to Earth domestic comedy and it is very funny. His performance is, as usual, superb and he is surrounded by well chosen actors who also provide laughs. The ending leans a bit too close to whimsical, but it hardly deters the viewer's enjoyment. Scenes involving Wilder's character and his friends jokingly discussing each other's affairs is equal to the perfectly written exchanges of a Woody Allen movie. Also worth noting is Gilda Radner's brilliant love lorn and scorned office colleague. Her presence on screen is a real high point.</p>
