<h1>Bedrooms and Hallways (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Keith runs a male bonding group, which was meant to be macho fun, but acts as therapist as dreaded-unmanly emotional and even relational problems prove unavoidable. Openly gay Leo is delighted to find hunky, straight Brendan is a closet-bi and becomes his lover. Things risk ending ugly as it turns out Brendan's girlfriend is Leo's school ex and still able to seduce him.</p>
<p>A man enters therapy after many failed relationships and is disconsolate about having any social life. In the group session, he comes clean about his feelings for another group member which leads to a homosexual affair. Then the situation is complicated by the re-union with his original high school sweetheart and the whole thing transcends into sexual ambiguity.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of a straight friend, gay man Leo joins a men's group, where he causes some upsets by declaring his attraction to one of its members.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the UK, it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humour is centred around a new-agey men's self-help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth'.  They also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.</p>
