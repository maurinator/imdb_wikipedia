<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>any baby boomer who lived through- and went to college during the late 60s will identify with this charming movie. The Motown music, the parties, waiting breathlessly glued to the TV set watching the draft lottery, the protests, ....oh, and the romances!...I have never seen a movie that captured that very special time better. You will fall in love with these characters who could have been your own friends and classmates. And you will almost wish to be back in that situation again. Because even though it was scary and painful, what some of us did, collectively, changed history, and that is an empowerment that is hard to come by these days. The movie does not strike me as dated, even though it authentically recreates the look and feel of the era. Today's 'young people' should discover this movie, and us aging folks should enjoy it again.</p>
