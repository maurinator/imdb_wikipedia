<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was probably better if viewed when it is not one a.m. in the morning but the BBC in their wisdom decided to relegate a classy film like this to the slot around midnight. In fact if it had not been on straight after Highlander I probably would not have watched it. If I hadn't I would have missed a treat. Tommy Lee Jones was at his brilliant best as the private dick hired to find a man's dead wife. I did miss a bit in the middle which did not help but I was a little confused for quite a while about who was and who was not dead. Maybe that was the entire point of the film. But the film does carry an important message "The dead can't lie. It's something I've learnt."</p>
