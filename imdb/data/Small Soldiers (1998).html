<h1>Small Soldiers (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>15-year-old Alan Abernathy, the son of a toy store owner, tries out some new action figures: The Commando Elite vs. The Gorgonites. But three months ago, a toy company believes it is onto something when it employs the latest government military technology in a series of action figures, enabling them to talk. They underestimate the power of the special micro chips they've employed, however, as the two opposing sides of the toy line start thinking for themselves and engaging in real combat! The Commando Elite vow to wipe out the Gorgonites in a suburban neighborhood. Alan, his neighbor Christy Fimple, (on whom he has a massive crush) with the help of the kind Gorgonites, must protect his home and family from the Commandos.</p>
<p>After military manufactured computer chips are put in a line of action figures, they end up with minds of their own and try to invade an Ohio suburb, and do battle with another line of toys that have the same chips.</p>
<p>Alan, son of a toy store owner, tries out some new action figures: The Commando Elite vs. The Gorgonites. What he does not know, is that both sets of toys were designed to move, talk and play back. The Commando Elite's purpose is to destroy the Gorgonites. Unfortunately, the toy designer who was responsible for the programming, bought highly intelligent military computer chips that are usually used for steering missiles - and are able to learn. Now, the Commando Elite, led by Major Chip Hazard, is up to destroying the Gorgonites, led by peaceful Archer, who hide in Alan's parents' house. Now, a battle, in which the destructive ability of creative computer chips against creative computer chips with a different attitude comes to light, is about to begin.</p>
<p>When missile technology is used to enhance toy action figures, the toys soon begin to take their battle programming too seriously.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not really sure who this film is aimed at.  At times it seems to be a child's movie and at other times it seems to be for adults.  But nonetheless, I loved the film.  I thought it was a fun story.The special effects alone are worth watching the film.  It's truly amazing how fluidly the toys move and life-like the little toys are.  Also, I really liked the various Gorgonite characters, they all looked quite unique.The cast is quite good too.  Phil Hartman is quite funny in the film, as usual.  Kirsten Dunst pulls off a great performance.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well: Gregory Smith, Jay Mohr, David Cross, Denis Leary, and Kevin Dunn, to name a few.  I really feel that actors in films like this don't get the credit they deserve, because they are acting against small little harmless platic or metal animatronic toys, or, in some cases, against nothing at all.  So just keep that in mind when you're watching this film.  The voice talents in this film are also quite good, with plenty of big names to go around including Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy, Clint Walker, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christina Ricci.This film is just a fun film, there's nothing terribly deep or mind-boggling about this film, just enjoy it for what it is.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but if you read the plot description and it sounds interesting, then by all means, check it out.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris</p>
