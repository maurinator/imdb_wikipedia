<h1>Uncle Joe Shannon (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A trumpet player, self-destructive after the death of his wife and child in a fire, befriends a crippled youngster and together they battle obstacles through each other's encouragement.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with another reviewer, it is low budget, but it still has that vintage late 1970s warm fuzzy glow around it along witht the waste and the emptiness that gets to the pit of your stomach (remember the scenes, in the long run it'll warm your heart.  A few nice props being a NJ boy is that Doug McKeon, the actor who plays the little boy, is from Pompton Plains NJ and Mr. Cassidy is in teh NJ Boxing Hall of Fame.</p>
