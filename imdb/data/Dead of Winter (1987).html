<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't know what to except, reviews didn't give a clue what I'm going to watch.Well first of all, big minus for the beginning, somewhere in 10 minutes or so you get the idea of whole movie. Don't get me wrong, this was very interesting and very well acted and all, nicely put together, and the ending was little twist that saved a lot.Few parts doesn't make any sense in the movie but that didn't bother me. It was lovely to watch the whole movie with huge interest for the ending.Truly worth of watch if you can handle thrillers and 80's style doesn't bother you.And for the last words, this was pretty original for a thriller.. legendary maybe. Now I got lost in nostalgic, enjoy!</p>
