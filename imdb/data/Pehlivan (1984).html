<h1>Pehlivan (1984)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie is about a Turkish wrestler who very much wants to win the Kirkpinar Championships. He isn't getting younger and so he decides this year it would be his last chance to be champion. Tarik Akan is one the best male actors of all time in Turkey, (unfortunately he never had the desire to go to Hollywood). He plays his role brilliantly till the very (anti-climax-esque) end... Note: Tarik Akan was covered in olive-oil voor this role. The oil the wrestlers use is extra "thick", therefore the smell of olives is present for a few months.Another great movie with Tarik Akan is "KAN", which means blood.</p>
