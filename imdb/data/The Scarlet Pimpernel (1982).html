<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the French Revolution, a mysterious English nobleman known only as The Scarlet Pimpernel (a humble wayside flower), snatches French aristos from the jaws of the guillotine, while posing as the foppish Sir Percy Blakeney in society. Percy falls for and marries the beautiful actress Marguerite St. Just, but she is involved with Chauvelin and Robespierre, and Percy's marriage to her may endanger the Pimpernel's plans to save the little Dauphin.</p>
<p>During the time of the Reign of Terror, French aristocrats are being sent to the guillotine for the merest infraction. There is only one man who is seemingly able to save them, the Scarlet Pimpernel. He is really Sir Percival Blakeny but his true identity is known only to a very few. Acting effete and foppish in society, he's actually a dashing hero who personally rescues those he knows have been unjustly convicted. While in Paris, he meets and eventually marries the lovely stage actress Marguerite St. Just. His nemesis is Chauvelin, the head of state security, who will use any means, including threats to Marguerite's brother, to get the Pimpernel. For his part, Sir Percy's goal is to save the young Dauphin, heir to the French throne.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I absolutely loved this movie!  The first time I saw it I was totally on the edge of my seat.  It's not a movie where you can predict what happens next. Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKlellan are wonderful!  I would recommend The Scarlet Pimpernel to anyone and everyone.  It has suspense, romance, adventure, it's absolutely incredible!  I could watch it everyday and never get sick of it!</p>
