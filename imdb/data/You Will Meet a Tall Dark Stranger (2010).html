<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>great script as always embedding with woody's insight to spot on the truth of human nature, it's wonderfully true. Funny to see that 100% of the characters in the story are all mess-up in the way they live their life, with lies, hurts, ignorance, fear, denial, confused, wonderful character studies in this script, and daring of Woody to try a new way to end the film, new way to edit the story, much mature it is. I personal sees that the case might be the reason this film doesn't deliver to what it had been able to, but also, it is the evidence too that Woody is like Picasso in movie, Picasso is never afraid of painting, he paints almost every day and he never intends to make each painting a master piece, he just paint, as a painter's vocation, he tried all the mediums, he try move away from getting use to one look in his paintings, so within thousands of picasso's painting, there are enough master pieces to make him the Great, and that's how I see Woody, he is a brave film maker, he never cares too much about what people say, he never stops to write and to film, he never stop to try new cast, new career move, if the location is done with New york, fine, London, and Muses come and go..fine, try to film another one till he finds one and he did, he had all these great actresses to work for him in his lifetime and this time, he comes to a new group of casts, though it's not delivering as the other group of talents, it's a new look on Woody's never-ending -trying career, and I am sure, he is going to always get the GREAT Work soon or later and his film would never be the last one, he is always producing, it is just to live, you will always meet another new stranger...</p>
