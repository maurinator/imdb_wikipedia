<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>GIRL OF THE NIGHT is amazing in that it was produced at a time when such themes as are involved remained taboo. Yet, here it is...and it is a formidable film, with an exquisitely modulated performance by Anne Francis, whose beauty probably prevented her from being considered for some of the powerful roles she could have done easily.John Kerr is excellent as well, especially due to the fact that such a role is played against accepted thought of the period. Who could have envisioned a pimp so good looking. Kerr was a far better actor than his credits indicate -- he had proved his ability on stage AND screen in Tea and Sympathy. Lloyd Nolan, whose abilities grew stronger as he moved away from leads into supporting roles, is superior as the analyst (though his office hours in the same building are slightly askew). Dark and brooding and often brutal, this film would have been an award contender in later years. Now, it remains a wonderful artifact of an era when not everyone was holding back against the formulaic look at the world.</p>
