<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>You can see the joy on the faces of Noemie and Marc when they reunite after being apart for six weeks. During a week-long vacation with Laure (Marc's distant cousin) and Cyril - a French expat couple vacationing on Galiano Island off the coast of Vancouver - Marc and Noemie meet Lyse. Lyse is friend of Laure and Cyril from Quebec. She joins the group regularly, helping them discover the island, which she knows like the back of her hand. But the group dynamic changes when, attracted to Marc, Lyse attempts to seduce him. Marc and Noemie suddenly find themselves confronted by the temptation to explore the unchartered territories of love, forever altering the delicate balance of their relationship, until now committed, trusting and tightly-knit...</p>
<p>A group of young Francophones visiting the west coast decide to stay on Galiano Island, where things turn out to be very different from back east.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is very much an easterner's view of the west coast, everything is goofy and unstructured, and adultery is a habit very easy to slip into.Numerous California-comedies have dealt with this theme, this time it is done in French - the characters combine French and Quebecois. It is about their reaction to post-modern Vancouver, and then to Galiano Island, where they decide take a holiday.It seems like a sitcom made into a movie, maybe when it gets English subtitles its greater depths and existential angst :) will become apparent. As it is, you get pleasant entertainment with some wonderful scenery.</p>
