<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In medias res: narrator Jerry Falk, a fledgling comedy writer with an inept agent, is about to celebrate an anniversary with his girlfriend Amanda. There's trouble in paradise: she's late (and has already eaten), she's been uninterested in sex for months, and her quixotic mother is moving in with them. Jerry looks back to meeting Amanda and dumping Brooke. A constant is his friendship with another wannabe comedy writer, a 60 year old teacher named David, prone to long walks and advice filled talks. As Amanda and Jerry's relationship founders and her mom's noisy presence makes writing difficult for him, he and David plan something different. Wouldn't anything else be better?</p>
<p>Jerry Falk is an aspiring writer living in New York City who falls in love at first sight with Amanda and dumps his girlfriend to get with her. Seeking advice, Jerry turns to the aging struggling artist who acts as his oracle -- and that includes trying to help sort out Jerry's romantic life.</p>
<p>Jerry Falk learns a lesson the hard way when he falls head over heels in love with a beautiful but flighty girl, Amanda.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here's a Woody Allen film that makes sense. Here we have a two guys Jerry(Jason Biggs, "American Pie Movies", "Saving Silverman") and David(Woody Allen) who is a complete neurotic all through here. Jerry has this problem about finding work in New York. COME ON! Everything is here in The Big Apple! However, his love life is more complicated than his line of work. His girlfriend Amanda(Christina Ricci) is totally unpredictable. Jerry should have known in the first place to break off the relationship with her, but no, he has to go along with her game. David's character is a mirror image of the master himself. The storyline of the movie is an exact duplicate of New York life itself, it was well-made, the scenery is absolute perfect, and the characters of the movie are amazing. I agree with some of the things David says about what's going on in the world. And Jerry ended up going solo to the West Coast because of David's own problems. What a pity for David, but I do wish the best for Jerry. This movie go style, it got class, its got plenty to say, "Anything Else?" Get a clue! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!</p>
