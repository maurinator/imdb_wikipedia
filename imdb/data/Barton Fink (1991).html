<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liken the Coen brothers to Haagen-Daz ice cream, i.e., various stages of good.  I would argue this dark film, laden with more allegories than Dante, is not their best...but, it's good, damn good.  To begin with, stellar performances form Turturro, Goodman, Mahoney, Buscemi and Lehner.  The thing I find amazing is the skill in bringing so much darkness to such a bright, colorful cinemagraphic work-- remindful of Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers, in that regard-- that teeters on the edge.  Goodman's last scene walking into the burning hotel room is eerie but very bright (why not?  The damn place is burning down.)  This is another great Coen brother film and let's hear it for Ethan and Joel!  See it!</p>
