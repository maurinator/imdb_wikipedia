<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Karen has to take a ride in Frank's car. He's travelling with his wife, on his way to sell computer chips, which he obtained illegally. He suspects his wife is being unfaithful and tragic things happen, following a discussion. Karen escapes, reaching a lab where a scientist has discovered how to go back in time, and she returns by accident some minutes before the violent events. Then she tries to make things better, but things tend to become worse, as time cycles keep being repeated.</p>
<p>A woman, whose car breaks down on the highway, is picked up by a crazed stranger and his obviously threatened girl friend.

After a series of murders, including the girl friend, the woman manages to escape to a scientific lab where time travel is being experimented with. Here she asks to go back in time to try to stop the killings. Repeated attempts results in the same deaths.</p>
<p>A psychiatrist makes multiple trips through time to save a woman that was murdered by her brutal husband.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My 14 year-old son and I really enjoyed this movie.  Belushi did a great job as Frank,  the good-old southern boy that has a bad-d-d-d-d temper.  We classify this one as a sleeper,  because most people have never heard of it. Good time travel movies are hard to find,  but as most of us learned back in the original Star Trek days,  time travel is VERY dangerous.   In this movie,  we learn that right away,  but it goes even farther to show how even when we redo the trip back in time,  even good intentions by supposedly intelligent people,  can make things even worse the 2nd (or 3rd) time around.  I guess the best part of movies like this is that they make you think 'What if I could go back and do something over again?'  Word to the wise,  if you do.... be very careful.</p>
