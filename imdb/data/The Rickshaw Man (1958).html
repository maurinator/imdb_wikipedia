<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why on earth its so hard to get this film on video? Only an extreme bad English subtitled VHS, a good Chinese subtitle, but no German subtitle or German synchronized. I saw this film 40 years ago in German cinema, and except a Japanese VHS or DVD (see above)there's nothing to receive. This film is so good, that I even can understand the meaning of the Japanese Video. (With the help of my Japanese woman) The tragedy of a Rikshaman is shown in an excellent way, how he helps a young boy, when his father died, and that he cant marry the mother of that boy, because he is from a "lower Kaste". I hope one day I will get a German - or at least an English copy, to understand all the words, they say.</p>
