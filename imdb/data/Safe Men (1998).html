<h1>Safe Men (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two untalented singers are mistaken for a pair of major league safe crackers in Providence, Rhode Island. The two are pressed into service by the local hoodlums and quickly find themselves in conflict with their professional colleagues. Romantic interest is added by the daughter of the underworld leader who won't date the men she knows are gangsters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Safe Men" plays as if you took a nice assortment of Woody Allen comedies and put them through a blender. The Jewish jokes, including a hilarious bar mitzvah will appeal to the ethnic audience, while the outrageous ideas like exploding pants, will appeal to almost everyone. I have never seen Jewish stereotypes portrayed better, in part because of the incredible casting choices. Each character is so interesting, you will wish they each had more screen time. Sure it's ridiculous, but so are "Idiocracy", "Strange Wilderness", and "Office Space". Along with "Safe Men" the common thread between these comedies , is that each one will hold up to multiple viewings. - MERK</p>
