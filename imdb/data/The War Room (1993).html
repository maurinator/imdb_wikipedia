<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's 1992. This documentary follows the Clinton campaign from the New Hampshire primary to its Little Rock headquarters as they win a landslide victory over Bush Sr. The team is led by the bombastic raging Cajun James Carville and the scholarly Greek George Stephanopoulos. They face scandals like Jennifer Flowers and draft dodging allegations. They try to work on a story of Bush printing campaign material in Brazil but nobody is willing to write it up. Then there is Perot walking away from the election and finally entering the fight. It's a great insight into the heart of the operation. It's not all cleaned up for the camera such as when George plays hardball against a final minute allegation that Clinton fathered a black baby. It is possibly the first of its kind and maybe not to be repeated. It's also fascinating that these characters would become political TV stars. It's a behind-the-scenes look unlike anything before or possibly since.</p>
