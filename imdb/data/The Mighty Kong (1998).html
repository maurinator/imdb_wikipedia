<h1>The Mighty Kong (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ann Darrow, a down-on-her-luck actress looking for work, meeting film director Carl Denham, who offers her a job in a new movie. They board the Venture to leave for the film shoot. The monkey that lives on board causes trouble throughout the trip. They arrive on the island and the natives, who are friendly to the crew, ask that the crew leave Ann so they can sacrifice her. Ann is then sacrificed to the giant ape King Kong who makes off with her into the jungle. Together they fight a dinosaur and are off the island in five minutes. The film then follows Kong's rampage of New York City. Kong takes Anne up on top of the Empire State Building. The biplanes come and attack Kong with guns, but miss most of the time. When all the planes have been knocked down the army sends two blimps with a net in between them to catch Kong. They catch him successfully. Kong tries to get out of the net, but the net rips and when Kong reaches for Ann, he falls from the net. He bangs into a balcony and plummets to the ground. During his fall he is shown crying. Kong's "mightyness" ends when he slams into the streets of New York. However, Kong survives the fall to make a more family-friendly ending.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The only reason why this isn't a 1 is because of the voice cast, both Dudley Moore and Jodi Benson do play Kong and Anne very well. However, the animation quality is very uneven, the colours are nice and Anne looks lovely but some of the other character designs are wonky and the backgrounds especially after the Skull Island sequence, sequentially the film's best bit, are shoddy. The story meanders at this point too, with subplots that unravel faster than a ball of wool and a romance that feels contrived in alternative to poignant, and when it came to the characters Carl's part is very corny and the cabin boy was completely unnecessary. While most of the dialogue is embarrassing being quite hackneyed, the musical numbers are where the film really falls down. Not only are they not needed but they are very dull and insipid, with Carl's number faring worst mostly because the lyrics were so gut-wrenchingly awful. After seeing this, I have changed my mind which is the worst King Kong movie(initially the 1976 movie), this takes the cake. 2/10 Bethany Cox</p>
