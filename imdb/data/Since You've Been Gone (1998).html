<h1>Since You've Been Gone (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of a 10th anniversary High School reunion, told through the eyes of a doctor who was humiliated on graduation day by being badly beaten up by a fellow graduate.</p>
<p>Kevin MacEldowney, a struggling doctor, doesn't look forward to his ten-year high school reunion ever since he was humiliated on graduation day after being beaten up by the school bully Pat Prince. But at some urging, Kevin reluctantly attends with his wife Mollie and their gay family friend Zane, a struggling singer/composer. At the reunion, Kevin not only encounters his former nemisis, but an assortment of troubled people each with their own agendas who include: lonely psychopath Grace, business loser Duncan, angry publisist Clay, writer/therapist Holly, back-luck streak Electra, wealthy European business woman Maria, and the obnoxious host and former class president Rob Levitt.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was really interesting. It is a complex, multifaceted examination of life after high school. Every character is fun and special in a certain way, and the story itself is well woven. The few things that peeve me: one is how Schwimmer got first billing on the cover - he's not the main character, Kevin is. The other is Marisa Tomei. Her name is ON THE COVER, but NOT EVEN in the movie. Argh!</p>
