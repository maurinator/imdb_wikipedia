<p>Big time Texas Wheeler Dealer (Ivy league educated, but plays dumb) runs out of money and goes to NYC to raise 1.5 million.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since accidentally catching this film several years ago on cable, I have counted this as one of my favorite films. It is dated by its 60's chauvinism but sports some of the snappiest dialog and humour since George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart wrote. My favorite movie quote of all time comes from this film. I hope you give this a viewing. I promise if you like subtle and not so subtle dialog driven satire, this is a film for you.</p>
