<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There aren't too many sports-centered stories I've seen that are quite as well done as "Streets of Gold."  The character development is well done, and the pace of the story is lively. The acting is good, and the dialogue engaging.This is a story that I'm guessing most sports-fans will enjoy, but has enough depth to make it appealing to those who usually prefer something with a bit more emotional depth.</p>
