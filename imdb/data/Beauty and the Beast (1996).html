<h1>Beauty and the Beast (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The program sees controversial radio broadcaster, Stan Zemanek, matching wits with a panel of beauties including Belinda Green, Jeanne Little, Johanna Griggs, Julia Morris, Donna Gubbay, Lisa Wilkinson, Prue MacSween, Maureen Duval and Ita Buttrose. When they are not tearing strips off each other in the battle to have their opinion heard, Stan and his panel offer sound advice to viewers seeking answers to life's toughest questions. The opinions and the advice offered are as diverse as the guests, and no topic is taboo.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since Beauty and the Beast started in 1996, the show just continued to get stronger and stronger every year. 2001 was the best season. The show was hosted by Stan Zemanek, better known as 'The Beast.' Stan was opinionated, intelligent, and more importantly honest. Sure Stan was rude to the women, but he was able to give the viewers who wrote to the show the answers they needed to hear. At the same time, Stan was able to make the show funny with his sense of humour.And then Foxtel replaced Stan with Doug Mulray. Mulray is no Beast. It gets really annoying when all the beauties laugh at him, and when he laughs at himself. The reason it's annoying is because he's not funny. And every time the beauties answer the questions, he agrees with every one of them. Though it may sound rude that Stan was always interrupting, at least he was able to say what was right or wrong with the answers.And what the hell is with these new beauties? Hey Foxtel, why don't you bring Jan Murray back? Are you scared she'll walk all over Mulray.In conclusion, the show is not worth watching now. The only thing that can save Beauty and the Beast is to get rid of Doug Mulray, and bring Stan back. Unless Stan returns, do not waste your time watching this now boring piece of crap.Until he returns, catch Stan on 3AW radio station (I listen to it through the internet), or read his book The Thoughts of Chairman Stan.</p>
