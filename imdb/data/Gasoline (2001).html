<h1>Gasoline (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fiery, dark-haired Stella, an intense auto mechanic, and nervous, blonde Eleonora (aka Lenni) are young and in love, and are from opposite ends of the social spectrum. They operate a gas station peacefully, until Lenni's mother appears and voices her disapproval of their lesbian romance. When Stella takes action in the heat of the moment, blood flies and the young women end up with a corpse on their hands. The lovers realize they must flee in order to stay together.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are looking for lesbian sexploitation, you are in the wrong place. Sure, Stella (Maya Sansa) and Lenni (Regina Orioli) are lovers, but their sex scenes are chaste.Lenni's mom (Mariella Valentini) is visiting and slaps her and Stella hits her back. She dies and they put the body in a dump and plan to get out of town. Mom brought 20 million lire (10,329.20 Euros or 14,539.38 U.S. dollars), so they had money.They keep getting chased by this band of thugs who want their money. They have no clue how much.The film starts in a gas station, and they end up back there and end in a Thelma and Louise variation.The movie just never had a spark that made it great. I was good enough for a GLAAD nomination, but not for a win.</p>
