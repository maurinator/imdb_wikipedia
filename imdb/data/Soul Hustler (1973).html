<h1>Soul Hustler (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Matthew Crowe, a whoring, pot-smoking, wandering singer teams up with a tent-show preacher. The preacher recognizes Mathew's charisma, and together they collect big donations delivering sermons with rocking gospel songs.Soon enough, Matthew lands a record deal, and the older man becomes the manager of Crowe's new act: Matthew, Son of Jesus. They hire a backup group of mustachioed rock musicians, who play in brown monks' robes, in contrast to Matthew's white robe and sandals. Their debut album becomes a huge hit so they go on a concert tour to promote it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since Casey Kasem died a few weeks ago, I've been going on the internet searching for his various movies in which he played parts, as opposed to just being himself. Here, he's Birnie, a public relations man for Fabian and his manager, Evin Calder (Tony Russel), a preacher who discovers him when Fabian tries to bilk some money from him during one of his sermons. Oh, and did I tell you Fabian plays Matthew, a sex and drug addict? Anyway, Casey is very much a '70s character with the bushy mustache and curly hair and that familiar voice was a great asset here. The film itself is quite good in exploring the complicated feelings of Fabian's character especially when he falls for a woman played by Nai Bonet. So on that note, Soul Hustler is worth seeking out. I saw this on YouTube.</p>
