<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I vaguely remember seeing Recess: School's Out in theaters when I was a little kid. I remember watching the television show and enjoying it. Many years later, I get a chance to watch the movie from my adult eyes. On the whole, the film is not a bad movie. I liked the story and the characters of the film. The story is simple, but nostalgic and the characters simply have life to them. Not all is perfect, though. The animation is quite shoddy and some of the dialog is not entirely effective.This film is about a bunch of kids who are out on summer vacation. T.J Detwiler is bored, because all his friends are at summer camps. Detwiler happens across a scheme where an old principal is trying to get rid of summer vacation forever. So T.J must grab his friends and some unlikely allies to stop this man from ruining these kid's lives. The voice cast of the film is not too bad. I am not too familiar with the actors who played the main characters, but they did a good job. James Woods did voice the villain of the show and his villainous character is actually quite scary. Overall, Recess: School's Out is a pleasant diversion for families and especially the young ones. It's based off the hit TV show and I feel they did the show some justice. It's nowhere near the best of animated movies and it does have some faults, but there is no denying the charm of the film. Fourteen years after I saw this film in theaters, I still enjoyed it. My Grade: B-</p>
