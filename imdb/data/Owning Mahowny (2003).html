<h1>Owning Mahowny (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dan Mahowny was a rising star at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. At twenty-four he was assistant manager of a major branch in the heart of Toronto's financial district. To his colleagues he was a workaholic. To his customers, he was astute, decisive and helpful. To his friends, he was a quiet, but humorous man who enjoyed watching sports on television. To his girlfriend, he was shy but engaging. None of them knew the other side of Dan Mahowny--the side that executed the largest single-handed bank fraud in Canadian history, grossing over $10 million in eighteen months to feed his gambling obsession.</p>
<p>Based on the true story of a Toronto bank manager, Dan Mahowny is addicted to gambling. Horses and sports are only a few of his interests. Eventually, he creates dummy accounts at his bank and uses that money to fly to Atlantic City to gamble. He seems to get little joy from winning and his addiction is such that he is unable to stop in any event. Even if he wins huge amounts - which he does - he simply continues to play until he has lost it all. It's a frighteningly lonely experience that cannot include friends or anyone else around him. In the end, his hours and hours at the tables give him nothing and as his embezzlement catches up to him, he is arrested and sent to jail.</p>
<p>A bank manager with: (a) a gambling problem and (b) access to a multimillion dollar account gets into a messy situation. Based on the story of the largest one-man bank fraud in Canadian history.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I chose this film based on its cast, not its plotline, which I didn't really think sounded very interesting.  However, I've been a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman since State and Main, and I also like Minnie Driver, so we took a chance and bought tickets for this film.  I was so glad I did.  It was a fascinating (kind of like looking at an accident) look at a "nice guy's" descent into gambling.  It started small, and continued to spiral out of control as we watched in horrified disbelief.  In fact, I would say that the script was unrealistic if I didn't know this was based on a true story. One little complaint...Minnie's blond wig was rather distracting, and truly not necessary. Other than that, I highly recommend this film.</p>
