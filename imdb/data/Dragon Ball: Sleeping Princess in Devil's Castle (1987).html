<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In order for Goku to become an apprentice of Master Roshi/Kame Sennin, he and a bald boy named Kuririn must fulfill an assignment. Master Roshi wants a woman around his home for cooking and cleaning. The assignment is to retrieve the slumbering princess from the lair of Lucifer. Once Goku and Kuririn bring back that princess, then they will become the students of Master Roshi himself.But both Goku and Kuririn will learn that Lucifer's Lair is a ghoulish and hellish place to visit. As it's fully populated with goblins and night dwelling beasts. With the help of old friends and personal strength, Goku will have a winning chance in retrieving this princess.Like the previous movie, this is an alternate retelling of how Goku first met Kuririn, how he became Roshi's student, as well as how they first met Lunch(the split personality woman).The story to this one is enjoyable with all the recognizable and made for the movie characters. Only down side is it's less than an hour. But if you are a fan of the Dragonball series, then you wouldn't mind that at all.</p>
