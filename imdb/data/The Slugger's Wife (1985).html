<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this was going to a different movie. When I saw it, I thought it was going to be about baseball. Well, "technically" it was about baseball. A guy walks into a night club with some of his baseball buddies and ends up falling for the singer that was on stage. She doesn't seem interested in him until he offers a wager that they go out together. They hit off for a little while then they get married. The two come from different backgrounds so they really can't understand each other. He wants to play baseball and she wants to sing and perform. They really can meet together at a common ground but where is that fine line?</p>
