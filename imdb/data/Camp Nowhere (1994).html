<h1>Camp Nowhere (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Morris "Mud" Himmel has a problem. His parents desperately want to send him away to summer camp. He hates going to summer camp, and would do anything to get out of it. Talking to his friends, he realises that they are all facing the same sentence: a boring summer camp. Together with his friends, he hatches a plan to trick all the parents into sending them to a camp of his own design, which would actually be a parent-free paradise. Blackmailing former drama teacher Dennis Van Welker into helping, they must convince the parents that the camp is genuine, and that they aren't allowed to visit...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is another of those films made about and starring kids where adults are really rewriting history in a fantasy way. Wouldn't it be neat if we had taken the money that mom and dad spent on camp and conned them into sending us to an unsupervised camp run by kids? Well, the story is enjoyable enough, the parents are simple (stupid) enough and the kids all get something they really wanted (without recognizing it beforehand) Not a great movie but an ok time. I'd be surprised if the critical reviews of this film don't mostly come from kids (or soon to be ex kids) who think its dumb. But that silliness is part of what makes this light comedy enjoyable.</p>
