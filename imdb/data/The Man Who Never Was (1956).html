<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>British Intelligence during World War II is trying to get the German High Command to shift its forces away from Italy prior to the invasion. To create the illusion that England is in fact planning to invade Greece, they plan to procure a dead body, plant secret papers on it, and arrange for the Spanish authorities to find it and send the papers on to the Germans. That's the plan, anyway. First they have to find a body that will look drowned, then create an identity for it that will pass German scrutiny. Based on a true story.</p>
<p>True story of a British attempt to trick the enemy into weakening Sicily's defenses before the 1943 attack, using a dead man with faked papers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on "Operation Mincemeat" during World War II, this film is an  excellent example of a spy movie that is interesting without being  gimmicky or melodramatic. An excellent cast is headed by the  redoubtable Clifton Webb.The elaborate plot to trick Nazis by using a corpse masquerading as a  dead Royal Marine officer is amazing in its detail. The film is all  the more astonishing because it is based on the actual ruse to deceive  the enemy into thinking that the invasion of Italy would take place in  a location other than where it actually happened. A good film for  espionage lovers.</p>
