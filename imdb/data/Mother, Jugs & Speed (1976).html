<h1>Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Los Angeles: A new law says that the first ambulance that arrives at an accident obtains the contract to transport the injured person. The result is ruthless competition between several companies.</p>
<p>Two privately owned ambulance companies compete for the city contract in LA. The focus, F+B Ambulance Service, has the wildest crew on the block. Cosby (Mother) plays the veteran driver to whom rules are meant to be bent. Keitel (Speed) is a cop on suspension for suspicion of drug peddling to minors who needs to pay the rent. Welch (Jugs) is the dispatch secretary with secret ambitions who won't give the boys in the bunkhouse the time of day. Drama and comedy bleed together over who makes the right decisions to land them in the money and keep them out of the hospital.</p>
<p>Competition between privately owned LA ambulance companies is played for humor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A '70s masterpiece, MJS is a dark comedy about rival ambulance companies working the tough streets of modern-day LA.  It is Bill Cosby's movie all the way as a smart-aleck driver, but he is lent able support by a large cast that includes a young Harvey Keitel as a suspended cop and freshly minted driver and Raquel Welch as a dispatcher and secretary with higher aspirations.  Lots of ribald humor and gritty scenes, not all of them played for laughs, by any means.  Sort of like CAR WASH, only more dramatic and shocking, even by today's standards.  I would say it is due for a remake, but Hollywood would probaly screw it up.</p>
