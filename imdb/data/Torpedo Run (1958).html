<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are interested in the way the Navy crew operates under the ocean floors,  you will love this great Navy story about how the U.S. Navy was able to out wit the enemy which was Japan during WWII and all the tricks of the trade that were utilized under the very depths of the Pacific Ocean.  The photography was great for a 1958 film and  Glenn Ford( Lt. Cmdr.Barney Doyle),"Pocket Full of Miracles",'61, gave a great performance along with some mental blocks that was interfering with his command of his submarine. However, Ernest Borgnine(Lt.Archer Sloan),"Marty",'55, was a loyal officer to Barney and turned down his own commission as Commander to assist Barney in  his hopes to destroy a FLAT TOP (aircraft carrier) of the Japanese Navy.  There was a very interesting scene where the submarine crew was able to evacuate their sub and be able to surface to another submarine for safety.   This is truly a Classic film from the past and I am quite sure some of these events actually happened during WWII.</p>
