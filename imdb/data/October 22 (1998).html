<h1>October 22 (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An almost typical day in the lives of several Los Angeles residents, with their moments and experiences intersecting in many different ways in stories involving love, desperation, obsession. All those men and women are finally put together by the tragic fate of going to a diner that was about to be attacked by a dangerous armed man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is exactly why there are indie films... for smaller, dramatic stories that don't fit neatly into one specific genre. But this is an involving, emotional movie full of extraordinarily strong acting from its ensemble cast. It's especially rewarding to see Michael Pare do such a great job, and to see Broadway star Donna Murphy in a motion picture. And I especially loved the score, by UK pop star Midge Ure. I also like seeing Amanda Plummer, Ernie Hudson, and Colm Meaney cast against type, but Tate Donovan delivers the majority of the comic relief in the film, as one might expect from his exemplary sitcom work. Not a theatrical gem, but a classic rental. Too bad there are no extras on the DVD.</p>
