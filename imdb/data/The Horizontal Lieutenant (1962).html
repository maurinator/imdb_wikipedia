<h1>The Horizontal Lieutenant (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>1944. Hapless Second Lieutenant Merle Wye of the US army's intelligence service is dismayed that he has not seen any action - he imagining himself as a suave undercover agent, worming secrets out of exotic female spies - instead being confined to a desk job in Honolulu. For non-military reasons, Merle is assigned a new posting - his first field job - that on the South Pacific island of Rodahan. He eventually learns that both his job on Rodahan and the posting in general are rather innocuous, as the Americans liberated Rodahan from the Japanese eight months ago, there has been no action there ever since, and as such it is a rather quiet, idyllic locale. All the Japanese soldiers on the island surrendered at the time, that is all except one, a man named Kobayashi, who is unarmed and seen as being harmless because of it. Merle's job is to locate and bring in Kobayashi, solely because he has been pilfering luxury goods from the US army commissary and officers' quarters the last little while. Merle's task, however, does take on some urgency as his new superior officer, Colonel Charles Korotny, who sees Merle as being useless, threatens to ship him off to what is the remotest of the remote army outposts if he makes the Colonel look bad by not being able to achieve this one simple task. Merle's job is not made any easier by the presence of Navy Commander Jeremiah Hammerslag, also newly posted to the island and a man who is overly officious also to be rather useless, and the help of Merle's underling, Sergeant Roy Tada, who is more interested in the twelve women he is currently courting back home than he is with anything to do with the army, especially if those army tasks get himself killed. Through it all, Merle tries to bolster the nature of this job and its dangers to woo the woman of his dreams, army nurse Lieutenant Molly Blue, who he knew and basically dismissed while in college back in Kansas, but who has blossomed since, and as such can have her pick of any man she wants, most who outrank Merle.</p>
<p>A military comedy about a luckless army intelligence lieutenant who finds himself stationed on a remote island army outpost during World War II, where all the action is between the sheets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jim Hutton is a fond favorite actor of mine, and at his best he could be quite funny -- his best comic effort in my opinion is in "Who's Minding the Mint?" He teamed up 4 times with Paula Prentiss, mostly due to the fact he was tall enough at 6'5" to tower over the 5'10" young lady. These four films with Hutton were Prentiss' first 4 films of her career. She was also a talented actress adept at comedy - her best comedy role, again in my opinion, was in "Man's Favorite Sport?", alongside Rock Hudson.Hutton and Prentiss were an attractive couple - she very sexy and long legged, he somewhat gangly and bean-pole thin, but with a great deal of boyish charm and a winsome self-effacing manner. Hutton was groomed to be a new version of Jimmy Stewart, in fact. he stayed youthful enough to successfully play Ellery Queen in a TV series when he was over 40.With this nice pairing of leading man and lady, and the always funny Jim Backus added to the mix, this should have been an engaging comedy. The fact that it is no better than so-so is not the fault of the actors.The film, which is based on a novel, is meant to be similar to a number of World War II military service screwball comedies that were released in the late 50's and early 60's. It tries to capture the spirit of "Teahouse of the August Moon" and "Don't Go Near the Water", both starring Glenn Ford, and "Wake Me When It's Over" starring Dick Shawn. However, it never quite makes the grade. The situations that are supposed to funny just don't quite hit home. There is a bit too much reliance on slapstick pratfalls that you can see coming a mile away, and a couple of scenes with good humor potential are wasted by sub-par dialog.But, the cast is gamely trying their best and the great chemistry between Prentiss and Hutton comes through in some (but not all) of their scenes together. This movie is a nice time-killer, but it was not nearly as good as I had hoped.</p>
