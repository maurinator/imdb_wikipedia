<p>SIB recreates the true story of twin 12-year-old daughters whose poor elderly father and blind mother kept locked away inside their small house for their entire lives without any playmates or visitors. The girls are released to experience the sweet joys and harsh dangers of the outside world. The actual family members involved in the case play themselves in the movie.
