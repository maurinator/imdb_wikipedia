<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>James and the Giant Peach was for me one of the most magical animation movie i have ever seen. I enjoyed every part of this film, the music the dancing and most of all the unique voice of Ms. Ladybug she was the best. Most of the times when i get sad i just play that first song that James sang it truly lifts my spirit, even though it made me cry. I also must say that James two aunts acted well in this movie even though they where monsters i enjoyed them. overall this is a great movie for anyone who likes adventure a family movie that brings sadness and joy altogether. James and the Giant Peach i give it a 9/10 for its well casted and well acted which for me made this movie a must see.</p>
