<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film, admittedly, is not the best of the genre but it is entertaining if you set aside the obvious parallels to films that came before. In fact, the script intentionally incorporates previous films by references from Dodge and Piper. The one at the end was hilarious!It could have been better in a few places and it certainly could have been worse. Better: have a little more animated performance from Baldwin, perhaps a little less gore and sadistic behavior by the Cubans and a bit more believability in the fire-fights. Kudos to Mr. Hooks for keeping it from becoming worse! My wife and I enjoyed watching this film and would recommend it to any free-thinking adults looking for a fairly good film to watch after the kids are in bed. Don't forget the popcorn.</p>
