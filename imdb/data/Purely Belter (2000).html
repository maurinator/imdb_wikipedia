<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's not everyday that a movie moves you beyond words. As a football fan myself, I totally understood how important it was for those kids to have season tickets for Newcastle United. I could totally relate to the love they had for their club and the way they wanted to be respected. After all, that was all they ever wanted: respect. How to get it? Well, those are just boys with difficult lives. Their way to get respect was unorthodox, but how can I blame them? It has some funny moments, but this is mostly a sad story. Sure, this is not a feel-good movie. But why would it be? It is much better than that. And despite all the bitterness, I was left with a smile in my face and a lonely tear in my eye: those boys were happy and I was happy with them. Maybe the direction is too much predictable (after you see one Mark Herman movie, you pretty much saw all he has to offer as a director), but it has amazing characters and unpredictably amazing acting. I just love a movie that doesn't let me be indifferent to the story and the characters. This is such a movie. Totally recommend it.</p>
