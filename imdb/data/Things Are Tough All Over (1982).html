<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well folks if you liked Up in Smoke, Next Movie and Nice Dreams then you should give Things Are Tough All Over a try even though they didn't smoke pot in this movie but there is a little drug humor in this movie.This movie is about the duo working at a car wash in a very cold freezing weather in Chicago and they got fired and they decide to drive a limousine all the way from Chicago to Las Vegas and there are two guys (Cheech and Chong in a double role) who are after them and what C&C didn't know was that the limousine was filled with money.This movie was a different approach to Cheech and Chong cause it didn't take place in L.A. and there was alot less drug humor than the previous movies and while it may seem a somewhat forgettable movie, it's a pure classic compared the Still Smokin' and the Corsician Brothers and I think that all C&C fans should watch this movie.6/10</p>
