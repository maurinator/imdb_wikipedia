Among the girls are Tiffany, (who her father has to bribe to attend meetings, Emily (the daughter of an out of work actor, whose financial difficulties hinders her wanting to participate in certain activities), the neurotic Tessa (whose parents divorce has forced her into therapy twice a week), the hostile Chica (whose parents are too busy with their own lives to even remember her birthday), and Claire (the child star who see the wilderness girls as her chance to lead a "normal" life). Phyllis then begins to take the girls camping at a Beverly Hills hotel and earn patches relating to material things. The district leader, Velda, feels the troop should be disbanded.

Then Velda begins to sabotage the girls endlessly.</p>
<p>Phyllis Nefler, a soon to be divorced Beverly Hills society wife is determined to prove to her husband Freddy and herself that she can finish what she starts out to do.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pure Silliness makes this one a classic.  I loved it as a child and continue to watch it as I grow up I recommend this picture to anyone who enjoys a silly good time. Oh and they have to be able to stand Shelly Long, which I've noticed some people can't.  Oh well their loss. Beverly Hills What A Thrill!!</p>
