<h1>Truth or Dare (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From the rain of Japan, through threats of arrest for 'public indecency' in Canada, and a birthday tribute to her father in Detroit, this documentary follows Madonna on her 1990 'Blond Ambition' concert tour. Filmed in black and white, with the concert pieces in glittering MTV color, it is an intimate look at the work of the music performer, from a prayer circle with the dancers before each performance to bed games with the dance troupe afterwards.</p>
<p>This movie reveals Madonna as she really is, on stage and off - den mother to her family of dancers, sex goddess to her millions of fans, business woman, singer, dancer... the biggest superstar in the world of music. Join her and experience an intimate backstage look at her Blond Ambition tour.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I feel that this film shows Madonna at her best. Sure, there are some embarrassing moments but isn't that what is so great about the whole film? Here, we get to see Madonna as the bossy control-freak, as the carer, as the organiser, as the comedienne and more. As Madonna once said, the film is worth about 5 years of psychoanalysis so why not see it and find out about the real Madonna? You might not like her; but you can't help but love this film.</p>
