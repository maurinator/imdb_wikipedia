<h1>The FBI Story (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the FBI unfolds through the eyes of one of its agents. During his career he investigates gangsters, swindlers, the klu klux klan, Nazi agents and cold war spies.</p>
<p>This film follows the career of fictional FBI agent Chip Hardesty. It starts off with the 1955 airline bombing by Jack Graham who placed a bomb in his mother's suitcase so he could collect the insurance and killed 44 people in the process. The story then goes back to 1924 when a dissatisfied Hardesty is thinking of leaving he agency. His interest is reignited with appointment of J. Edgar Hoover as the new Director and a renewed sense of mission for the FBI. Working with his good friend Sam Crandall, he tells the story of some of the major cases he worked on: the fight against the Ku Klux Klan; the case of Oklahoma Indians who were being killed for their oil-rich lands; and the fight against the slew of high profile 1930s bank robbers including Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, John Dillinger and Ma Barker. During World War II their focus was on Nazi spies and subversive elements. By the 1950s, the focus was on communist spies.</p>
<p>While giving a lecture at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, veteran agent Chip Hardesty recounts his career with the bureau. He goes all the way from the days when the bureau was nothing more than a over-glorified legal clerks office to the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country. He also recounts the various cases he worked on from fighting the Ku Klux Klan to fighting communist subversives.</p>
<p>A dedicated FBI agent recalls the agency's battles against the Klan, organized crime and Communist spies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Entertaining docudrama about the history of the FBI, as told by one agent in particular named Chip (James Stewart). Yes, it's more fiction than fact but it's also a good movie. Judging by some of the reviews here, most of the people hating on the movie seem to be political ax grinders. Obviously J. Edgar Hoover had a hands-on part in the making of this film. He inspires Jimmy to stick with the FBI in an amusingly corny scene. But I'm judging the movie on an entertainment basis, first and foremost, and this movie is entertaining. The FBI parts are great. The parts dealing with Jimmy's domestic life not so much. Vera Miles is very attractive as a blonde and plays the clich√©d but likable wife role well. It's just this part of the movie isn't that interesting and takes up too much time in a movie that goes on for over two hours. Murray Hamilton is good as Jimmy's partner ("I never want to cool off! NEVER!"). If your blood boils about J. Edgar Hoover or you demand absolute historical accuracy from any film depicting real people and events, you'll hate this. But if you like Jimmy Stewart, you'll certainly find things to enjoy here. He's really the whole show. Whether he's taking on the KKK, gangsters, and Commies or just getting ticked off at his kids, he's fun to watch. It's a little long but never boring.</p>
