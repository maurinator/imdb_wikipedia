<h1>The Girl on the Broomstick (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Saxana has the enthusiasm, but lacks the right talent to become a witch. So she's kept in for 300 years - nothing unusual for a sorceress' school. Being bored, she skims through the magicians' lexicon and finds a formula which brings her into the world of the humans for 48 hours. There she meets the friendly Peter who takes her with him to school... and the adventures begin.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a fun this movie! It's a continuous flow of gags from beginning to end, a mine of ideas and fantasy. The "theme" - a beginner witch is trying her first spells Â– has nothing to do with the real witchcraft, because it's a mere narrative handle to build funny, hilarious, ironic situations. A very successful handle indeed, because the plot runs riot with very entertaining scenes. What makes this film so funny is its not taking itself seriously and its joking without malice on persons and themes. The school teachers turned into rabbits and locked into a hutch, the pupils who suddenly get donkey ears and their she-teacher walrus teeth, the boy who "looses" his head and tries to replace it with a clay head of Napoleon.... these are just some of the situations of this movie. I kept on laughing almost the whole film through. Special effects are simple, but not at all childish and unsuccessful. After all, with good ideas, modern technologies and heaps of money are not necessary for making a good movie. The Czechs were great in the fairy tale genre, and had at least one precious quality which the other Eastern Europe countries did not have: the absence of political propaganda. The Russians or the Germans of GDR couldn't refrain from putting it in almost every movie. And the political propaganda spoils the magic and the lightness of a fairy tale. In this one you will find none. Somebody says that it is an ancestor of the Harry Potter saga. Nothing of the kind! The child wizard takes himself tremendously seriously, and pushes the poor children of the real world to emulation. This is just an innocently funny movie, where spells are almost laughed at, because they are only a way to.... laugh.</p>
