In the end, Leo returns to Piper telling that The Powers That Be have given a second chance to them."Once Upon a Time" is a very silly and boring episode of "Charmed", where the transformation of Cole into Belthazor is the best part. I had good expectations for this show after "Magic Hour", but I was really disappointed with the fate of Piper and Leo. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Era Uma Vez" ("Once Upon a Time")</p>
