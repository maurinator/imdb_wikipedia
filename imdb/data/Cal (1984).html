<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this film very much particularly because of its Irish flavor. John Lynch is incredibly real as an IRA member(not of his own doing) who really hasn't the stomach for it.  Everything about the film is as it should be.  Lynch's long suffering Cal who has helped murder the Protestant husband of the woman he is now infatuated with is wonderfully portrayed.  Day to day life of the people is almost like watching a documentary. Cal's guilt-ridden life couldn't be more boring from playing his guitar to borrowing tapes at the library to spying on Marcella all the time aware that the UVC will burn him and his "Da" out.Love the Irish lingo and wit as well as the Uilleann pipes and traditional Irish soundtrack that make it sing.  The sensual relationship between Cal and Marcella is bound to take off but you know it is doomed from the start. Two people searching for meaning in a harsh and lonely world.  Helen Mirren gives another great performance as the unsatisfied older woman giving in to love.  If you want to see a simple film about real people don't miss this sad, revealing tale.One of my all time favorites.</p>
