<p>A chronicle of the lives of several teenagers who attend a New York high school for students gifted in the performing arts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant. Plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great.I've seen it at least dozen times and still I'm not tired with the plot, characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack that I've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that I owe).For me it's a must-seen kind of movie, great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end.</p>
