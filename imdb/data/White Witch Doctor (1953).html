<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rather enjoyed this film even though it was a little slow in some places. The cinematography alone should have garnered an Oscar nomination (if it didn't) as the settings in Africa were brilliantly and beautifully photographed.  The story revolves around a nurse played by Hayward who goes to Africa to assist a woman doctor in taking care of the sick people there. Susan Hayward plays the nurse and upon arrival meets a businessman played by Robert Mitchum.  He thinks she's crazy for staying and she's definitely going to stay!  Hayward's and Mitchum's lives become endangered when someone decides to make greed the name of the game.  Definitely worth watching and sorry it is not available on video.</p>
