<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie with my dad when it first came out at the now long-gone Cinema Theater on Miami Beach.What I recall most about it was the rare beauty of Inger Stevens. What a beautiful, lovely, sexy, talented actress. It is really a sad state of affairs that her personal demons ended her life so young. I recall hearing about her death on the t.v. news and how I cried a few tears; even though I was a young child of 9.The movie is fast-paced, exciting, well-acted, and the Paris of the 1960s is in all it's glory.Unless this movie comes out on DVD, it will be lost to the ages. Most likely it's about forgotten, except for those lucky enough to have seen it. I even have the original movie poster of this film hanging on the wall of my apartment.</p>
