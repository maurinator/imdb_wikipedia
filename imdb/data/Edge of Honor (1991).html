<h1>Edge of Honor (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of scouts stumble onto a cache of stolen weapons hidden in a forest. They meet up with a girl and get involved with the men who originally stole the weapons. The men try to shoot the scouts every time - but are thwarted at the end.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This time it's scouts/kids vs. gun-runners/killers. The plot is exchangeable, the faces are exchangeable, the fights are exchangeable.Nothing new here or so it seems... But there's something very odd and it's got to do with the character played by Meredith Salenger who seeks revenge on the crooks who've killed her family right before her eyes. Salenger's traumatic conversion from happy and likeable country girl into gun-tooting, vengeful vigilante doesn't help the whole movie (which rapidly goes downhill afterwards) but it remains a very impressive sequence. ></p>
