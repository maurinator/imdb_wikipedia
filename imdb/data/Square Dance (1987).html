<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Greetings, readers. I played Dub Mosely, the preacher in this film. I thought you might like to read a few notes about Winona, who was around 15 at the time we shot this on a sweltering summer day in Waxahatchie,Texas. I have met few young women of her age with the poise and sophistication she possessed. Working with her and Jane Alexander was truly a learning experience and a wonderful one. Although I didn't have scenes with Rob Lowe, I'm proud to have been in this film with him. His portrayal of the young violinist was astounding. I have never seen him do better work, either before or after.Now, here's a little inside stuff. After we shot the film, Daniel Petrie, the director, found that my southern accent wasn't broad enough. He and I discussed the situation after the film was cut and I explained my thoughts as to the reason I kept the "twang" to a minimum: It was at the time of Southern preacher Jimmy Swaggart's problems with a woman of -shall we say- easy virtue, and my characterization was founded on the feeling that "sounding" like that sort of a preacher might remind the audience of Swaggart's indiscretions and they could maybe "lose their concentration" on the film and,instead, wander to thoughts of the current events of the day, making it difficult to get back into the film at hand.Petrie had actually booked me to fly from Texas to Los Angeles to re-voice the role in the required accent. Naturally, I would do anything he wanted -he was the director and it was his film. Unfortunately I was performing in a stage production in the Houston area at the time and could not make the scheduled taping session. Another actor was flown in and the part was, indeed, re-dubbed.Petrie didn't like what he heard, evidently, and decided to stick with my original voice and accent. As a result, what you hear is my original interpretation. Actually, you hear me more than you see me. That's my voice over the shot of the radio during the opening moments of the film. And, don't blink during the revival scene. That's your's truly at the pulpit.I don't know if they'll let me cross-recommend here, but if you want to see more of me check out "They Still Call Me Bruce" and "Not For Publication". I hope you enjoy "Square Dance". It is definitely worth your time and should be in your home library, if only for Winona's and Rob's portrayals.</p>
