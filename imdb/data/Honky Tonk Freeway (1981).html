<h1>Honky Tonk Freeway (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ticlaw, a small town in Florida, has only one attraction: a safari park. The government constructs a freeway that passes near Ticlaw, but decides not to put an exit into the town. The people of Ticlaw, led by its Mayor, will do anything in order to convince the governor to alter the project.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the early '80s, I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable.  Since then I have waited, hoping it would be on DVD.  Yesterday I found it.  It is one of the best humorous character studies I ever saw.  The Old Fashioned episode is priceless.  At this time (4/28/02) only two have reviewed it. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, either rent it, or buy it as I did.</p>
