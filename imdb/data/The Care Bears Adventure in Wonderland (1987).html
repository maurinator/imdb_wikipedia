<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>*********************** S P O I L E R S ************************* This is a classic movie. Much better than the first for young kids. So it is only loosely based on the Alice in Wonderland concept but it is highly inventive and colourful and loveable.It also has a rare thing - some good songs! Nowadays it seems Childrens movies just get thrown around for commercial value and stuck together in no time. Effort has been put in over the songs in this movie.I bought the video (or rather had it bought for me) back in the 80s and although I'm now in my twenties I still go back and watch it now and then.Sad maybe but this is a great movie and definitely recommended for children and especially those born into the world of dire late 90s children TV.</p>
