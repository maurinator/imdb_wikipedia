<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kagome Higurashi is like any other 15 year old student. Like any other, until she discovers that she can travel through time via the Bone Eater's well...Not unlike the series, Toki Wo Koeru Omoi takes place in Feudal Japan with a bit of Present day mixed in. Unlike the series, the first of currently three movies strays from the Naraku plot and into another enemy.Enter Menomaru. A demon who's father, Hyoga, was sealed beneath the Tree of Ages by Inu-yasha's father 200 years past. He fools Inu-yasha into attacking the claw which sealed away Hyoga's power, thus destroying it and releasing Hyoga's power. His power takes the form of a great orb. Menomaru allows himself to be engulfed into it, thus absorbing the power of his father.Collecting the souls of every living thing, Menomaru's power grows to immense size and soon, he becomes reborn with near limitless power as the New Hyoga.(Side note: During all this, Sango and Mirkou are fighting battles against Menomaru's servants, Ruri and Hari, who both are slain)While this passes, Kikyo sends Kagome to her own time, as she was not meant to be there. Kagome and Inu-yasha somehow manage to contact each other, although 500 years apart. Inu-yasha gets Kagome to come back to Feudal Japan.With the help of Kagome's arrow, Inu-yasha's Backlash Wave hits Hyoga, killing him and earning them a Shikon shard.Overall, this is very much like what happens in the series, but with larger detail. One detail I didn't enjoy was the 3D effect on the Tree of Ages. It takes away from the overall picture. But, in a grand total, I give this movie a 9.5/10(1/2 point for 3D)</p>
