<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Back in college "midnight movies" at the local theater primarily showed "Barbarella," "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," or "The Groove Tube."  "The Groove Tube" was the best of that era's skit movies that included "Dynamite Chicken," "The Boob Tube," and even lesser known attempts at showcasing underground comedy troupes like Second City and The Groundlings.  The original version was rated X and featured full frontal male and female nudity.  I understand that later versions were edited for an R-rating but perhaps with time the film is back together.  At the time it seemed raunchy, dirty, gross, underground, and subversive, but with twenty years of Saturday Night Live, Howard Stern, and films ranging from "Porky's" to "Something About Mary," it's more like 'Saturday Night Live, the Movie' (some skits are funny, most are not, nothing we haven't seen elsewhere.)  The funniest and most original skit has to do with a children's show that features a man's private parts dressed up to resemble a puppet.  I remember real children's show hosts standing on their head and putting a doll's outfit around their upside down mouth.  I always thought that was sick.  At the time I couldn't believe that "The Groove Tube" got an actor to do a routine with his exposed penis (this was 1975 after all) and it was pretty shocking...and hilarious.  It is no longer shocking, but it is still pretty funny.  I hope that they didn't edit that out of the recent showings of the movie.  I also always wondered who's penis it was.  I think it would have been more provocative if they would have had a female host ala Sheri Lewis or Fran of "Kukla, Fran, and Ollie" talk to the penis but like I said it was only 1975.</p>
