<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>well,I'm two episodes in and I'm hooked.i was a bit dubious at first about the cast,but i have to say they've all got into their roles brilliantly.its especially worth noting the performances of steve evets and ricky tomlinson,both truly underrated actors who have a larger than life screen presence and boy can they deliver those emotional scenes...'in the flesh' is gritty,solid,brilliantly written and delves into questions never asked before.even the soundtrack has its moments of simple beauty.if you like zombies and you like good television,'in the flesh' is well worth watching.9/10.....(it loses a star because 3 episodes is not enough...which when you think about it,is a compliment to the writers and their ability to weave a gripping story....I'm hooked and 3 eps just isn't enough)</p>
