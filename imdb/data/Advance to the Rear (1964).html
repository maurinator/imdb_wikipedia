<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Union army outfit of misfits and rejects is sent to the Western territory. Southern spies try to figure out what they're up to.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one heckuva fun film. Although a pretty descriptive writeup has already been given, I gotta tip the proverbial hat to what seems to be the inspiration for the F-TROOP television series that debuted the following year. And, the use of balladeers, THE NEW CHRISTY MINSTRELS, to help set scenes for the film hearkens unto many a great "tried and true" stories of the period...including the legendary CAT BALLOU with Stubby Kaye & Nat King Cole as the Balladeers in question.I am going to have to track this down and plant it near THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL (another good comedy set in the same time period) on my viewing shelf.</p>
