<h1>The H-Man (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a narcotics deal goes sour and a suspect disappears, leaving only his clothes, Tokyo police question his wife and stake out the nightclub where she works. His disappearance stumps the police - until a young scientist appears who claims that H-Bomb tests in the Pacific, evidenced by a "ghost ship" that has turned up in the harbor, have created radioactive creatures - "H-Men" - who ooze like slime and dissolve anyone they touch.</p>
<p>A drug dealer named Misaki disappears leaving only his clothes. The next day the police go to question his girlfriend, singer Chikako Arai, and she informs them that she doesn't have any information on where he is. Later that evening one of his associates comes by to try to beat the truth out her. After he leaves he disappears in the same way that Misaki did. A short time later, a young scientist named Masada informs the police that there was a similar case of people disappearing and leaving just their clothes on a seemingly abandoned ship that was found by a group of fishermen who say that three members of their crew were dissolved by a living liquid that was created when the crew of the ghost ship went through a radioactive cloud. The police are skeptical at first but when they witness the liquid creature, now called the H-man, kill three people, including a policeman at a the nightclub where Chikako worked they now believe him. Now the police must not only find the criminal gang, but figure out a way to destroy the H-men before they kill all the citizenry of Tokyo.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the police are investigating a growing number of disappearances. They're primary interest is in a drug dealer but their interests quickly shift to the strange occurrence where they find people's clothing as if people just vanished while wearing them. The story starts to make sense when a fisherman tells them he and others from his village found an abandoned merchant ship. On board they too found clothing but no people. They also found a gelatinous green-glowing substance that attacked them and consumed some of them. The police soon realize that they are dealing with a creature created as a result of H-bomb testing. They also realize that the creatures is living in the Tokyo sewer system.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this when it was first released in 1958 in Sydney. The theatre was a very large and cold cinema. The atmosphere of the environs only added to the atmosphere of the film. I was six at the time but I can still remember it fairly vividly today - nearly forty years later. It gave me nightmares for weeks. I always thought this was the movie that the Blob was based on although the release dates seem to be fairly close. This by far was the better movie of the two. I have seen this once again in my older years and it still resurrects memories of those childhood nightmares.I would love to be able to obtain a copy of the film but it seems these days no-one seems to know of it.</p>
