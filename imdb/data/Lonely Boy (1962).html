<h1>Lonely Boy (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A documentary chronicling the career of teen singing star Paul Anka (the title is taken from one of his hit songs).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You can see the influence this film has had on countless other documentaries, and even feature length films, when you watch it. The jittery, being right there style that is presented in this film was very new at the time it was made, and it was good. It wasn't merely presenting the facts, but presenting them in a way that shapes how the audience will react to them.I thought the film was really exciting, even in 2003, and it is an inspiration.</p>
