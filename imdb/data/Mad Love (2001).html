<h1>Mad Love (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Juana is married off by her pious parents, the Catholic kings Ferndinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille, to ally Spain, united by their marriage, to the Burgundian and other Habsburg heritage of archduke Maximilian's son Philip. When they meet, it's love at first sight, for her all-consuming, for him one of many happy bed partnerships as she later discovers. Deaths in her family soon make Juana Isabella's heir, but Ferdinand suggests she inherited her grandmother's madness and supports Philip's ambition to rule instead, which becomes the stakes of political maneuvering in the Cortes (nobility-dominated parliament). Combined with Philip's incurable infidelity, which includes a Moorish whore-princess, multiple drama is inevitable, and worse follows.</p>
<p>In 1496, Juana de Castilla, daughter of the Catholic Kings, travels to Flandes to marry the Archduke Felipe de Austria, known as 'El Hermoso' (The Handsome) and son of the emperor Maximiliano. Even though at the beginning this marriage obeys a political decision, later on passion and desire appear beneath the couple. Juana becomes queen of Spain when her mother and her older brothers die in 1504. However, due to the pressure of being queen and the discovery that her husband has many lovers, her mental health starts getting worse. Felipe, seeing his wife in these circumstances, makes the Burgos Court to declare the insanity of Juana and recludes her in the Monastry of Las Huelgas, proclaiming himself as the king.</p>
<p>The love story who transformed Juana, Queen of Spain, into Juana "The mad". A story of passions, lies and jealousy with a politic fight behind.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>10 points from 10 for *Juana la loca*! And if there were 100 points I'd give all 100 for this amazingly beautiful and touching film!I've read all the comments and couldn't resist leaving here mine. *Juana la loca* is a film for sensitive people whose intellect has gone far than watching trashy actions and shallow soap operas. This Spanish drama makes a viewer use his intellect, it's not an entertaining film - it is too deep and too emotional, and too well-played to be called *soap opera*. Based on real events the film gives us the full description of those beautiful and at the same time sad pages of Spanish history. Pilar Lopez de Ayala is an unsurpassed young actress! She was so convincing in this role, so touching and so brilliant. She had no such a love tragedy in her own life but she managed to portray it on the screen. As if she had suffered it herself. All her words, especially those cried out in a heavy rain are pierced with pain and desperation. She played so naturally no matter whom - an innocent young girl, a woman in love or a miserable queen driven into madness from jealousy towards her husband. Bravo, Pilar !!!As for Daniele Liotti, Felipe el Hermoso, he also did great job portraying this monarch. Someone mentioned Antonio Banderas for this part? I'm sorry. I can't even compare these too men. Daniele is the embodiment of man's beauty! When I saw him for the first time it was quite enough for me to understand that PERFECTION DOES EXIST. No one better than him could fit for the part of the king known as *the Handsome*. So, farewell, Banderas. Not this type. Who said Felipe couldn't have such chiseled body as Liotti has? No matter that Felipe was a king, his body would be just the same as shown on the screen. First of all, he led an active way of life - constant hunting and riding a horse.These factors made him look like that. And his acting was appropriate for such a womanizer as Felipe. Great job, Daniele! Giving you 10 points also! And bravo, Vicente Aranda! Beautiful drama!</p>
