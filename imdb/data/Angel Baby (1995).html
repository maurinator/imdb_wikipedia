<h1>Angel Baby (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two schizophrenics meet during therapy and fall passionately in love. Ahead of them lies the inevitable road to disaster - one they share to the end.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know enough about psychosis to comment on the accuracy of the film, but it was certainly convincing to me.  I can only hope that Australian society is as sympathetic as it is presented here.  As a matter of fact, my personal contact with a psychotic showed American society off the screen much more civilized than Hollywood does.All the actors come through well, but my prize would go to the woman.  Some may think the ending a cheap shot, but it's hard to stop a realistic film from going on forever.</p>
