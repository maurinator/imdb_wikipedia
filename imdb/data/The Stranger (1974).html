<h1>The Stranger (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Will and Holly have been fighting more of late, which Rick knows can't continue as they need to work together to survive and get home. This cooperation is even more important as they end up trapped in a cave by the Sleestak. However, they encounter another Sleestak, who speaks English and seems not the same as the others. They learn this other creature's name is Enik, and has arrived here through a time portal as he is an evolved and peaceful descendant of the Skeestak. He is in possession of a device called a megeti, that if they know how to use it may be able to get them home. However, Enik warns them that he doesn't know if it can get them home as he doesn't know where home is for them. Their encounter with Enik may show especially Will how he as a being needs to evolve himself. But the Marshalls may be able to help Enik in return. In the Marshalls providing that assistance, Enik learns that his calculations of where he is is different than he first thought, and that he is not as evolved as he believed compared to humans.</p>
<p>The Marshalls meet Enik, an intelligent, time-traveling relative of the Sleestak.</p>
