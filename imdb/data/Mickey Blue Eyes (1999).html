<h1>Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An art-house auctioneer finds himself getting in deeper and deeper with the mob after learning that his teacher girlfriend is the daughter of a major mobster. Things get worse when a godfather decides to launder his no-talent son's gory paintings through the art house and gets the FBI into the picture. Everything then falls apart when the son is accidentally shot.</p>
<p>An English auctioneer proposes to the daughter of a mafia kingpin, only to realize that certain "favors" would be asked of him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So perhaps this isn't the best romantic comedy out there, but it certainly did have a few interesting twists, and some generally funny moments to it. Hugh Grant was the bumbling and charming Brit he always is, Jimmy Caan was great as the mob member daddy to Jeanne Tripplehorn. It's a fun film to watch and I think most people will enjoy it.</p>
