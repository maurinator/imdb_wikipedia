<h1>Harry and Tonto (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry is a retired teacher in his 70s living in the Upper West Side of New York City where his late wife and he raised his children--where he's lived all his life. When the building he lives in is torn down to make way for a parking garage, Harry and his beloved cat Tonto begin a journey across the United States, visiting his children, seeing a world he never seemed to have the time to see before, making new friends, and saying goodbye to old friends.</p>
<p>Widowed septuagenarian Harry Coombes lives with his beloved cat Tonto in the same inner city New York apartment he has for much of his adult life. So it is with great resistance that Harry moves from that apartment as his building is scheduled for immediate demolition. With no plans as to where to live, he and Tonto move in with his son Bert Coombes and his family in the suburbs. Independent minded Harry knows this situation is not either to his liking or to Bert's wife's liking. Before making a decision as to a more permanent living situation, Harry, with Tonto in tow, decides to visit his bookstore owning divorcée daughter Shirley Mallard in Chicago. But the planned New York to Chicago flight changes out of circumstances to a road trip. Along the way, Harry and Tonto meet a variety of people which affect his thoughts and ultimately where he goes, which includes a possible visit with Jessie Stone, an old flame he hasn't seen in fifty years, and a visit with his irresponsible playboy son Eddie Coombes in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>When his apartment building is torn down, a retired lifelong New Yorker goes on a cross country odyssey with his beloved cat Tonto.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Every once in a while - but less and less these days - a movie comes around that has some impact, in that you find it hard to get it out your mind for awhile. That's what "Harry and Tonto" did to me, recently.It wasn't the world's greatest film but it was great storytelling, sometimes a lost art among filmmakers in recent decades. "Harry" is a retiree and "Tonto" is his cat. The movie follows the two around as the pair travel from the East Coast to the West. It all begins when Harry's building is demolished as part of "urban renewal." He quickly finds out he doesn't want to live with his quirky son and his even-stranger kids, so he hits the road to Chicago to seek out other relatives. It goes from there.The movie is filled with little vignettes. For instance, how the cat adapts for doesn't adapt to some modes of travel and the interesting and very diverse people Harry meets on the way (which winds up going all the way to Los Angeles).Art Carney as "Harry Coombes" got the Academy Award for best actor. My vote might have gone to the cat. If you've ever owned a cat, you can appreciate how unbelievably-trained this feline was in the film. Tonto was amazing! Almost everyone in this film is a good person who tries to befriend Harry and Tonto, so you get a good feel throughout this almost-two-hour movie. It's one memorable short story after another - some funny, some sad. I hate to use this cliché, but it's the kind of slow-moving, human-interest story movie you don't see anymore. That's a shame, because these kinds of films you don't forget.</p>
