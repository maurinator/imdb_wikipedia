<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a perfect example that most of the games that come out when a huge movie is to hit cinemas can't be really good, because they either come AFTER the movie premieres, in this case they use to be better cause the STORY from the movie can be used, this is the other example, this game came out BEFORE the movie hit cinemas, it has different story, it's clich√© driven, has, shame to say, GRAPHICS on the level of 2008, mediocre sound effects, no special awards or bonuses can be collected, no bonus material, musical score is pretty good though and intense when needed and as for the overall keyboard/mouse handling thats yet again just OK, BUT it has a spirit to it, and fans of Star Trek will enjoy this few hours short adventure ;)There were tons of games in the past that came out when a huge movie was going to be released, most of them were BAD or MEDIOCRE at best, few were GOOD or REALLY GOOD, this is the MEDIOCRE case, you've got all your favorite characters lookalikes with the original cast voice-over, mostly they at least tried to deliver their lines properly, and as I'm a huge fan of Star Trek reboot, i would give this 7/10 just for the sake of it. This game's simply one time adventure, has by all means no repeating quality, while it's story takes place between Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and from the look of it, Cpt. Kirk and Cmd. Spock weren't "too busy".P.S. Just to make myself clear, i gave this 7/10 because i really do like both movies, if i should be really honest after playing all kinds of Video Games past 15 years, this wouldn't pass over 5/10. Also i would like to say GRAPHICS and SFX is NOT on the level of 2008, honestly, i could program and script a better video game in 2004, but hey, all of you Star Trek fans all over the world, do you really care what i think? I don't think so, Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, judge by yourselves and go buy it.</p>
