<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My dad took me to see this movie in the theater in 1975.  I was around 7 years old.  I guess I remember it most because it was one of the first movies my dad took me to see.  It is definitely  a tough guys movie.  The violence portrayed in the film stayed with me for years.  Especially the scene where Slim Pickens is thrown in front of a speeding semi truck. I've seen the movie many times on television since 1975 and have grown to appreciate it more.  Not being close to the trucking industry, I don't know how accurate a picture it paints for today, but I believe it hits pretty close for 1975.</p>
