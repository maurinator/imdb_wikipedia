<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From the tacky opening credits to the kitschy music, to the meandering script, to a supporting cast blending old stalwarts (Joan Blondell, Kent Taylor) and unknowns, to the "guest star" (Steve Inhant, Chips Rafferty) to the "special guest star" (Vera Miles), KONA COAST screams "unsold pilot." Calling from the home of a rich drug dealer (Steve Inhant)  A "party girl" loaded on smack Sam "the Man" Moran (Richard Boone) a bigger-than-life fishing boat skipper.  Boone begins a search for the "party girl;" whom, of course, is Boone's daughter.  With a minimum of information, Boone shows up at Inhant's home and makes not-so-veiled threats.  Though dialogue, we learn four days have passed since the girl's disappears (Aha!  Station Break), and the police pick up Sam because the girl has "washed up on the beach". Boone "puts the word out" on the street, and gets beaten up by a couple of Inhant's henchmen.  Boone's "neighbor" on the pier (Chips Rafferty), gets his lungs badly burned putting out a fire which destroys Boone's boat. Rafferty, who makes no attempt to act as if he is gasping for breath, asks Boone to put him on Rafferty's boat and take him home to die.  Rafferty's Aussie accent is thick enough to spread on a cracker. When Boone arives at Kona Coast (Rafferty's home), he meets Rafferty's "sister" (Joan Blondell), who sounds closer to Yonkers than Sydney.  Boone has never met Blondell before, but he know's the local tavern owner (Kent Taylor) as though they were old friends!  Blondell runs a retreat for reformed alcoholics, and one of her guests just happens to be an "old flame" of Boone (Vera Miles).  Boone meets Miles at the tavern rather than the retreat (I imagine, to save the number of shooting locations), and the tavern owner seems to know an awful lot about both Boone and Miles (?) Of course, none of this has anything to do with solving the case.  Not a problem; Inhant, for some reason, considers Boone enough of a challenge to come after him (!) exposing himself to the kind of public scrutiny even the most daring drug dealer wouldn't risk.  After all, wouldn't Inhant's suppliers feel "uncomfortable" providing "pharmasuticals" to a man this reckless? Further, Inhant's men don't carry any guns, and are pretty stupid to boot.  So, of course, Boone prevails, makes a business partnership with Blondell, and revives a noncommittal romance with Miles. As bad as this movie is (And it is REALLY bad), I've wanted a VHS copy for twenty years.  The movie is fun, in a mean-spirited way.  Boone is a delight to watch; this man laughs and snarls with such gusto, you can't help but like and respect him; even when the script calls for him to do some incredibly stupid things; and even when he is verbally abusive to Miles.  Boone is a man you can BELIEVE would take care of the "baddies."   Despite the horrible shot mismatches (closeups aren't even  properly posed), KONA COAST is also beautifully photographed, and has a more Hawaiian flavor than either HAWAII 5-0 or MAGNUM P.I.  The young supporting cast of Hawaiians and Polynesians is attactive, if not particularly talented.  And both Kent Taylor and Joan Blondell make the most of their few scenes and cliched characters.  Shut off your brain, watch KONA COAST and enjoy.</p>
