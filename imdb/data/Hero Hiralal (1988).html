<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Naseeruddin Shah is Hero Hiralal, a Hyderabadi Auto-driver, who happens to meet a Newcomer (Played by Sanjana Kapoor) starlet. Becomes a tourist guide to her, and in-turn they fall in love.Cut the starlet is back in Bombay and Hero wants her and follows her to Bombay, but her family wants him out of her life. She is made to say that she does not like him (but she actually does like). Dejected Hero wants to commit suicide. Saved by a Show Lady who wants Hero to die like a great lover in a greatest show on earth (played by Deepa Sahi). But will he die? Let it be suspense!Amitabh Bachchan has made a special appearance as himself. The movie has brilliant moments and the first half is very good, second pales in comparison (but is still worth watching). Naseeruddin Shah is dramatic, but good. Sanjana Kapoor (the first Kapoor daughter on screen - her niece Karishma is latecomer by over half a dozen years) is charming and has underplayed her role. Deepa Sahi in small role is good. Overall a movie worth watching!</p>
