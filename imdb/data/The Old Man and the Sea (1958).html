<h1>The Old Man and the Sea (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Now an old man, a lifelong fisherman sets out to sea to ply his trade as he has done all of his life. He's not had much good fortune of late and has gone almost three months without a major catch while others are catching one or even two large marlins every week. Many of the locals make fun of him and some say he's too old now to be fishing but he still loves what he does and is encouraged by a young boy who loves him and has faith in him. On this day he hooks the fish of a lifetime, a marlin that is larger than his skiff. As it slowly pulls him out to sea, the old man reminisces about his past, his successes and the high points of his life. When he does finally manage to land the fish he has to fight off sharks who are feeding on it as he tries to return to his Cuban village.</p>
<p>Based on the classic, Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name by Ernest Hemingway. The story of an aging, life-long fisherman attempting to find himself, and hopefully a fish, on a fishing trip in the gulf waters off Cuba. After spending most of his life alone, and losing his only companion, a young Cuban boy, the old man heads out to sea once again, the laughing-stock of all other fisherman. His 80+ days without a notable catch end on this trip, but will he be able to defeat the odds after catching a gigantic marlin?</p>
<p>An old Cuban fisherman's dry spell is broken when he hooks a gigantic fish that drags him out to sea. Based on Ernest Hemingway's story.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Sturges directed this reportedly-troubled production, a handsome adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story about an old salt who wants one last chance to catch a prized fish before he dies. This scenario puts extraordinary demands on lead actor Spencer Tracy, who is forced to hold the screen nearly alone for ninety minutes. Although he manages to ingratiate himself early on to the viewer, one still doesn't know how to take this character--is he likably stubborn or stubbornly foolish? Either way, Hemingway's tale doesn't quite make its mark as rousing cinematic material, however the finish is very satisfying. It gets a helping hand from Dimitri Tiomkin and his score, which won an Oscar. Remade as a TV-movie in 1990 starring Anthony Quinn. ** from ****</p>
