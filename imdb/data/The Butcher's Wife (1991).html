<h1>The Butcher's Wife (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A clairvoyant thinks she's met her husband to be because she's seen him in her dreams. They marry quickly, and return to the husband's ("the butcher"), home in the city. She has a big impact on everyone she meets by anticipating their questions and actions and advising them on their love life. Her interference then brings her into contact with the real man of her dreams.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>few drops of fairy tale. few clich√©s from classic romantic comedies. Demi Moore in a role with high potential and decent solutions. different family/personal crisis. solutions who remind old truth. nothing new. but a nice story about magic, expectations, true love. useful after a long work day. and for the fans of Demi Moore. boring for the predictability. because the few ornaments not are so attractive for ignore an old story, sweet, pink, lovely but far to be great about dreams and their clash with reality, compromises and the happiness as result of self definition. the different stories are a not bad spice. and the performances are far to be bad. but , after its end, the strong feeling - it deserves be better- is the basic gift from this version of fairy tale.</p>
