<h1>Tom Horn (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A renowned former army scout is hired by ranchers to hunt down rustlers but finds himself on trial for the murder of a boy when he carries out his job too well. Tom Horn finds that the simple skills he knows are of no help in dealing with the ambitions of ranchers and corrupt officials as progress marches over him and the old west.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Such a shame that the last two films Steve McQueen made didn't do very well, although it was probably a lot fairer on The Hunter which had the potential to be a great film, but the plot lost it way a bit. Tom Horn is considered to be one of the last great westerns, which Unforgiven was influenced by and got the recognition that Tom Horn didn't.The scenery is amazing especially the shot of the court with the sunset as the verdict is been given. This is such a great film, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
