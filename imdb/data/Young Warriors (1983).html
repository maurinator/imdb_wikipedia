<h1>Young Warriors (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young woman is gang raped and murdered in a California college town, sparking her brother Kevin to take up arms by night with a gang of like-minded vigilantes from his fraternity, brutally punishing any miscreants they catch in a criminal act. In the meantime, Kevin debates the issue of violent crime in the U.S. with his teachers and others during the day. As Kevin and his gang head toward a final, bloody confrontation with the low-lifes who murdered his sister, other scenes show the difference between his character, now violent, and the normal people he is supposedly protecting.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A party-hardy frat boy's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang, sending the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage.  He and his buddies massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life.SAVAGE STREETS was released a year after this film, and was more entertaining.  Linnea Quigley, who has a costarring role in this film as the sexy (and briefly nude) girlfriend of one of the guys, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS.This film is subpar, though it delivers enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience (me).MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language, and some sexuality.</p>
