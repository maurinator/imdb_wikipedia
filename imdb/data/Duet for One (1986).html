<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>...and also make a nonsense of your title.  The film is based on a stage play, which is so called because, although a two-hander, it is much closer to being a one-woman show.  The stage version was produced for BBC Television with Frances De La Tour, the original star, and is much more worth watching than this sentimentalised claptrap.  For one thing, when in a magnificent outburst she attempts to shock the psychiatrist by admitting that she has been "f***ing a totter", part of the power of this is by your wondering what is going on in the head of this refined and cultural woman, for her to be taking a dirty Steptoe-like rag and bone man into her bed. The point is completely lost if you *show* the totter, and what is more cast Liam Neeson in the part!Kempinski remained on the credits as the screenwriter, so it seems he only has himself to blame for this utter emasculation of what was really an excellent play, loosely based on the shattering loss of Jacqueline Du Pr√©'s art, career and normal life to multiple sclerosis.</p>
