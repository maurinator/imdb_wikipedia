<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anna Kalman is a London based actress. She has been unable to find love in her life. The reason why she came home early from a vacation to Majorca fits into that theme, as the man she met there and was initially attracted to ended up not being who she thought he was as a man. Upon her arrival home, she meets the suave Philip Adams, a financier who is a work acquaintance of her brother-in-law, diplomat Alfred Munson. Philip initially states that there is no Mrs. Adams in his life. But when Anna later asks him out, he clarifies that statement in that there is no Mrs. Adams in London, as she is at home in San Francisco. Regardless, Anna decides still to ask him on the date she had intended to the ballet. He accepts, letting her know that whatever happens between the two of them that he will never be able to leave his wife. As time goes on, the two fall in love, their happiness which can only be sustained as long as Philip has his Paris-based contract with NATO. So when Philip announces that he is being transferred to New York for five months, Anna comes to the realization that she truly cannot live without him and wants to marry him. Shortly thereafter, Anna learns something about Philip's background, which not only threatens their relationship, but leads to a night that Anna wants to give him that he will never forget, and not in a good way. But the best laid plans may have a bumpy road to being executed effectively...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is more than a little irritating that many men improve in looks with age but that only a few women do.  Cary Grant, James Stewart, Paul Newman, Sean Connery, Gregory Peck and many other male movie stars ( not Clark Gable though) seem to develop more charm and sex appeal along with the wrinkles and grey hair.  This preamble is by way of saying that Cary Grant is convincingly cast in 'Indiscreet' as a middle aged Romeo (he was 54) whereas the beautiful Ingrid Bergman is a tad too old at 43 to be playing the role of a beautiful theatrical star with whom Cary Grant falls instantly in love and gives up his bachelor life for.  I could not help but compare 'Indiscreet ' with their last pairing together in 'Notorious' in 1946 twelve years earlier.  Cary Grant is as suave, debonair and handsome as ever in 'Indiscreet '.  Ingrid Bergman's beauty though, has by no means waned but rather matured into middle age -  as well as becoming a size bigger.  Or perhaps it is just that every movie star looks better in black and white.No matter, it is still an endearing film with elegant sets and costumes. If only the comedy element had been played up more and the dewy romance element played down - in the style of the 1930s films such as 'My Favourite Wife' and 'The Awful Truth'.  Cary Grant is at his supreme best in this type of comedy. The best part in 'Indiscreet' for me was the comedy scene when Cary Grant danced in a highland reel - it was hilarious.  I am sure that with more emphasis on the comedy side and with better lines, Ingrid Bergman could have been a match for Irene Dunne or Rosalind Russell.Don't let my comments put you off.  Any film starring these two incomparable and much loved stars is worth a watch.</p>
