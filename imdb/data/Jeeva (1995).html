<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie brought back literate/educated Pakistani viewer back to theatre (cinema). It's one of the Lollywood good movies and nice attempt of Syed Noor. The movie story is not powerful but the songs and the acting of Javed Sheikh and Nadeem let the viewers to be in their seats during the movie. Syed Noor shot this movie in Pakistan and Turkey. The movie depicted one of the touching issues of Pakistani people where Syed Noor showed some Pakistanis guys try to go Greece illegally for job and better future of their families through the sea and get slaughtered by men-traders/smugglers. Two songs, 'Janu Sun Zara..' and 'Choo Kay Teray Man Ko Hawa.', of the movie were very popular during 1995 and 1996 and hit on 'Lollywood Top Ten' music chart for many week. The movies also included some of the religious sites of Turkey where the remains of popular Islamic personalities are on display for the public. Syed Noor is very talented write, director and producer in Lollywood world and always looked for new talents among teenagers and other experienced actors. He is also one of the directors of Lollywood industry who tried his best to bring back Pakistani viewers back in theaters (cinemas) during the era when every theatre (cinema) got converted to Shopping Mall by businessmen due to falling situation of film industry.
