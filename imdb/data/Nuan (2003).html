<h1>Nuan (2003)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with Ron Chow. This movie turned up one evening on national TV and proved to be well worth my time. And yes! The bike ride down the mountain and the duck-herd scenes! Unlike Ron, I am not a native Chinese speaker and relied on the English subtitles, which were well-written although suffer from the usual problem with subtitles, that much of what is said goes past one, untranslated, and one only gets a summary of the dialog. However, with actors like these, one could nonetheless enjoy this story. In that sense the subtitling was as good as that in Crouching Tiger, although this is not to say that the two films are in any other way comparable.Li Jia (aka Jia Li (II) on IMDb) is fantastic and deserves to be better known in the west, but I haven't been able to find anything about her anywhere. The casting of Teruyuki Kagawa, a Japanese actor, in the role of the deaf-mute was a stroke of genius.Definitely worth a watch.</p>
