<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Buddy (Affleck) has just signed an airline in Chicago as a big client, but is ironically delayed at the airport waiting for a flight to LA on that same airline. He meets fellow passenger Greg, who opts to be bumped, even though it means missing an activity with his older son. When the flight gets resumed, Buddy thinks he's doing a good deed by swapping tickets with Greg so he can get home to his son. Sadly, the flight crashes. Buddy conspires with his friend, the ticket agent that night, to take his name off the passenger list and put Greg's on. Once he's back in LA, his new client dictates that the company run a series of feel-good ads about the crash. Buddy feels very hypocritical, and completely loses it when the commercials win a Cleo. After going through re-hab, he decides he needs to check on Greg's widow. But he doesn't plan on falling in love with her.</p>
<p>Just prior to Christmas, O'Hare Airport in Chicago is snowed in, delaying flights in and out during which time many stranded passengers at the airport connect with each other, such as Los Angeles based ad man Buddy Amaral, Los Angeles based struggling writer Greg Janello, and Dallas based Mimi Prager. When Buddy's Los Angeles destined flight on Infinity Airlines is about to leave - the Chicago based airline which Buddy has just signed as a client - Buddy, in what he believes is a win-win situation, offers his ticket to Greg, who is trying to get home earlier to his family: wife Abby Janello and their young sons, Scott and Joey. However, early in the flight, it crashes, killing all on board. In the aftermath, Buddy's life quickly spirals downward out of control as he turns to the bottle, unable to deal with the guilt associated with how his innocent action saved his life but destroyed that of the Janellos. Going through therapy, Buddy feels the need to make amends by helping Abby without telling her about his connection to Greg. Buddy finds that Abby too is not coping well, telling white lies as a measure to deal with her grief, while not fairing well in her new job as a real estate broker. Following his good deed, Buddy tries to stay away from Abby knowing that nothing can come out of being with her because of his history with Greg, but with a little help from Buddy's new assistant Seth, Buddy and Abby fall for each other. The question becomes if there truly can be a future for the two of them either if Abby finds out the truth or if Buddy can deal with forever hiding the truth from her.</p>
<p>A man switches plane tickets with another man who dies in that plane in a crash. The man falls in love with the deceased one's wife.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I never even heard of this movie when it was in the theaters, not that that's anything all that new - but if Affleck and Paltrow were going to appear in it, it was worth a look-see.  The plot summary on my TV movie channel made it sound a bit like "Random Hearts" which was a good enough movie, but I wasn't all that interested in a copy-cat type of thing. But Paltrow and Affleck... Thankfully, this movie had a very different and very interesting plot. As I expected, Platrow and Affleck did a find job, in fact, my husband, who usually doesn't comment on such things, noted the fine acting.  But beyond that this was one of those movies that even though you know a lot up front about what it's going to be about, the writers have managed to pleasantly surprise you with how they handled it (and with no loose ends). Hope this gets better known as it hits the video stores and movie channels and a lot of other people get to enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
