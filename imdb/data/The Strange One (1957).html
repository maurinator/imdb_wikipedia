<h1>The Strange One (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jocko De Paris, cadet leader in a Southern military academy, so manipulates events that George Avery, Jr., son of the school's executive officer, is found drunk and expelled. Through various pressures, Jocko silences such involuntary accomplices as his roommate Harold Koble, football star Roger Gatt and freshmen Robert Marquales and Maynard Simmons, a girl-fearing cadet whom Jocko terrorizes into dating Rosebud, a town girl.</p>
<p>Jocko De Paris is an upperclassman at Southern Military College. As a platoon leader, he is generally well respected by the officers and the other cadets, the freshmen in particular who must obey his orders as a leader and upperclassman. He is also seen as overly tough on his charges. However, he is a sadist, initiating hazing rituals carried out by his fellow upperclassman Harold Koble against lowerclassmen, using fear and intimidation for them to keep quiet, despite those lowerclassmen knowing that they could be expelled for following illegal orders. Jocko also does not hesitate to direct his psychological torture against any of the other upperclassmen for whatever reason, his victims who sometimes don't even know what he's done to them until after all is said and done. Jocko does whatever he needs to to protect himself. One of those late night hazing rituals, which involved two freshmen, leads to another upperclassman, George Avery Jr. - the son of Major George Avery, one of the college's officers - being expelled, he who did nothing wrong. The two freshmen victims of that hazing are: Simmons, a milquetoast with strict Christian morals; and Robert Marquales, who quietly takes what is happening to him. While Major Avery deep in his heart knows that his son did nothing wrong and goes about trying to get anyone to provide evidence to that end, some of De Paris' victims may end up getting consciences, reporting De Paris at the risk of expulsion for all those in the know.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Back in the 1950s the movie Production Code in the U.S. censored topics and dialogue that it considered morally offensive or too provocative for a general audience. To get around this, Hollywood disguised the plot and dialogue in some films. The disguise allowed the presentation of underlying subversive themes, but in veiled form. "The Strange One" is a film with a provocative premise rendered opaque by its plot and dialogue.A Machiavellian-minded Cadet named Jocko DeParis (Ben Gazzara) throws his weight around at a Southern military academy. DeParis is a terrible human being: bullying, manipulative, and sadistic, yet unemotional, always in control of the situation. In the film's plot, he carries through on a well-thought-out scheme to have a cadet he doesn't like expelled. He uses other cadets to implement his plan, so that he personally cannot be blamed. One of his puppet cadets is a visually unappealing Cadet Simmons (Arthur Storch), a guy with a mouth full of conspicuous teeth, who doesn't approve of alcohol and doesn't like women.Another Cadet in Jocko's orbit is Perrin, (a.k.a Cockroach), a slightly effeminate guy, played by Paul Richards. Cockroach hero-worships Jocko, which thus allows Jocko to humiliate him in front of others. Yet, Cockroach, who refers to Jocko as "Night Boy", has his own plans, disguised by the script's dialogue, when he tells Jocko: "All I want to have is your confidence and your friendship". Well, you can see where this is headed in one sense, though the plot implies something else. The dialogue is heavy on subtext. And the film was quite subversive in its day.The film's B&W visuals are rather dark, in keeping with the story's subversive theme. A jazzy score amplifies the seedy nature of these inter-relationships. The film's casting and acting are quite good, Arthur Storch's bizarre performance notwithstanding.On the negative side, the plot doesn't explain why Jocko had such a grudge against others at the academy, nor do we learn the basis for his apparent political hold on the academy's higher-ups.Yet these are fairly minor issues. And my overall impression of "The Strange One" is highly favorable. In addition to a deeply thematic story, we get to see a number of actors early in their careers, including Gazzara, Pat Hingle, James Olson, and George Peppard, among others. This is a film that would have been all but forgotten had it not been released recently on DVD. It's worth a look.</p>
