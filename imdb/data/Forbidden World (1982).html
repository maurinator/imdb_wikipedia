<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ooohhh...for crying out loud ... If this isn't your cup of tea then WHY do you watch it AND feel necessary to rate it poorly ? If you're in sf and/or horror get this on a friday night, make sure you're in the right mood (ie a few bottles of beer wouldn't hurt )and you'll have riot... Just watch those 'multi-million dollar special effects'... I'm looking for it on DVD but so far no hope..</p>
