<h1>Code of Silence (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eddie Cusack is a Chicago police officer about to bust some members of the Comacho gang when the gang is shot up by a rival drug gang from the neighboring building, led by Tony Luna. Victor Comacho is the only survivor of the Comacho gang and his older brother, Luis, who is the leader of the gang, retaliates by killing Luna's family and kidnaps Luna's daughter, Diana. Cusack must face Tony Luna and Luis Comacho alone because nobody on the police force is willing to help him since he was the only cop who broke the code of silence by testifying against a fellow cop who killed an unarmed teenager, but Cusack is not really alone. A police robot called "Prowler" aides Cusack as he takes down the gangs.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris plays a tough, honest, Chicago cop. He gets trapped in the middle of an Italian-American mob war and tries to rescue an innocent kidnap victim. An underlying plot is Norris bucking the department over a questionable shooting of an Italian-American kid by a veteran cop. The only witness is a young police officer.</p>
<p>Eddie Cusack is an honest cop, who was conducting an operation involving some Columbian drug dealers. Now someone attacks the Columbians, killing all of them, and in the melee, one of the cops shoots a boy. He then proceeds to plant a gun on the boy. Now the brother of the Columbians, wants revenge on the one who did this. It turns out that the one responsible is the relative of a local mobster, he runs away when the retaliation starts. Most of his family was killed except for one daughter who doesn't exactly like what her father does. Cusack manages to save her and gives her some protection. Now the cop who shot the boy is given a hearing to determine if he was responsible. At the hearing Cusack denounces him. He then learns that the girl's been grabbed by the Columbian, he goes to help her but no one in the police department is willing to help him. He has to help her own his own.</p>
<p>Eddie Cusack is a tough Chicago policeman facing two crises stemming from a bloodily botched narcotics sting. The first involves a war that ensues between the gang of Tony Luna and Felix Scalese against Columbian "businessman" Luis Comacho, a war that sweeps up Tony Luna's daughter. The second involves Cusack's new partner, Kopalas; during the botched sting Kopalas witnessed another cop, a burned-out alcoholic named Craigie, shoot and kill an innocent youth then plant a gun on the youth, and Kopalas is torn because he fears breaking the code of silence that exists among his fellow Chicago cops - a code of silence that sweeps up Cusack when, at a civilian review board he testifies against Craigie, and is abandoned by his fellow cops when Luna's daughter is kidnapped by Comacho, Cusack is badly beaten by Comacho's gang, and Cusack must settle the gang war (and rescue the girl) once and for all with a "borrowed" robot police tank.</p>
<p>A Chicago cop is caught in a middle of a gang war while his own comrades shun him because he wants to take an irresponsible cop down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To me,it's kind of unfortunate that many people,when people mention the name Chuck Norris think mostly of "Walker:Texas Ranger"(if they're not thinking of the barrage of Internet facts and the Home Gym infomercials he's been doing with Christie Brinkley),which is a shame. "Walker..." may've offered people who enjoy their television simple,straight-forward and moralistic(not to meniton full of round-house kicks),but to me,Mr.Norris seems better suited for movies,where his quiet,confident and likable minimalism as an actor--which perfectly balance his awesome fighting skills--can go from introduction through denouement of a three-to-four act movie involving situation,rising tension,action,climax and conclusion,all in the tight space of two hours or so(As opposed to a recurring character over the space of twenty-plus episodes per season). But that's just my humble Opine.THis story isn't particularly taxing,as following suit with many of this genre: Tough,upright,fair and moral Chicago Sgt.Eddie Cusack(guess who?)has two looming problems on his hands--an IAD investigation into the shooting of a young boy in the projects involving two of his undercovers,one of whom becomes his de facto partner,and a gang war brewing between Italian and Bolivian(?) drug-families,which has him becoming the guardian of a scared Mafia princess(Molly HAgan). Cusack'll need his not only his toughness but also his wits(And a police robot,to boot)to play both families(the Latino family led by Henry Silva,a piece of excellent casting) off each other AND dodge the repercussions of bitter,corrupt fellow cops to make sure that justice is preserved and the innocent young woman in his care is not made yet another mob war casualty.Directed by rising star director Andrew DAvis(in another seven years,he'll helm the surprise hit "UNder Siege" and in eight,the blockbuster "The Fugitive"),this show uses A lot of Chicago--it's scenery,it's landmarks,neighborhoods and(last but not least)it's actors,none the least of which is someday acting staple but then former Chicago cop himself Dennis FArina(As Chuck's easy-going partner and erstwhile comic relief)--and it's all used to very good effect. About the only thing that doesn't cut muster here is the almost CAsio-like music that scores this,but being that this was a 1985 release,I'm figuring that this show was no more or less guilty of that than most films of the era. I got this movie out of the cheap,cheap CHEAP bin at the local music and movie resold store,and I must say that it better than makes up for the price paid. This film's been swept under,but to me,coupled with such lost classics as "The Octagon","Lone Wold McQuade" and "Eye for an Eye" are definitely worth your Norris film library,if you are so inclined to start one,of course.</p>
