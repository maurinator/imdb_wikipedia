<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen this movie in a couple of decades, but I was looking for good SF/Horror films to give my hubby for his birthday and immediately thought of this one. I saw it when I was a kid and it made a lasting impression on me because it uses the plot device of reincarnation and uses it well. I'm sorry to see it has received such a low rating here because it is an excellent film with a plot that deserved better than to end up as a second-rate drive-in flick. If you can find a copy or see it on some mid-night viewing you will do yourself a favor by watching it. It has a homey kind of class like a woman of the night whom you know is from a good family. It's a find, how ever you come across it. Having said this, I am off to try to find a copy for my library which has been without this treasure for far too long.</p>
