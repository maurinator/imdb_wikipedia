<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie back when I was 12; I liked it then, and still wouldn't mind seeing it again. Like all kids' movies, this movie has just a few corny kid moments that older viewers, especially teenagers, wouldn't prefer. But, unlike countless other movies, "The Parent Trap" included, this movie doesn't let all those annoying little things, like "I love you, honey! I love you with all my heart!..." get too far and make the viewer want to put a grim on his face and turn off the TV. They do it by using great acting skills by countless ingenious actors and actresses, and by not having a moment of nothing, but smiles, hugs, and extra-corny laughter get too long.Also, another advantage this movie has over "The Parents Trap", is that even 'though the main characters are both young girls, and one is an orphan in a group home, they are never portrayed as completely helpless, and in need of adult supervision; throughout the whole movie, all the adventures and gigs the girls think-up and go through they do with the help of no one, but themselves, and constantly help each other when either would get in a tough spot. The reason this is such a big advantage for this film is that in most real life, and most movies we see, all the main action is done and held by adults, and kids are treated as little and somewhat spoiled helpless creatures, who can't take care of themselves. This fact, often unconsciously, bores and sickens the audience, sometimes even bringing feelings of disgust towards kids. But in this movie, this problem is dealt with masterfully. Not only do kids here do things all on their own, but many times the adults, when in the same situation, look up to to them for help and advice. I thought this movie was made with a beautiful plot, truly great acting, very nice camera work, and, very importantly, very good character development: enough time is taken to introduce every important character's life before getting anywhere near the main idea of the movie. I would, personally, give this movie a 10/10, hands down.</p>
