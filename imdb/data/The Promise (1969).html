<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this on late night TV here in California in the late '70's, and was totally caught up in it.  The story concerns a love triangle between some kids caught up in the horrors of WWII Stalingrad during the battle, how they struggle to survive, and how their relationships carry through their later lives.  What kind of things are really important, what things last in people, and how people grow are the major themes.</p>
