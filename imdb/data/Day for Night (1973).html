<p>In Nice, the Studios La Victorine is producing the film "Je Vous Presente Pamela", about a French man that marries the English Pamela in England and brings his wife to France to introduce her to his parents. However, his father and Pamela fall in love with each other and she leaves her husband to live with him. The producer Bertrand and the director Ferrand invite British Julie Baker, who had a nervous breakdown and married her Dr. Nelson, to the role of Pamela. During shooting, the cast and crew are lodged in the Hotel Atlantic and Bertrand and Ferrand have to deal with problems with the stars Severine, an aging actress with drinking problems that affect her performance; the immature, spoiled and needy Alphonse; Julie that is emotionally unstable. But in the end, they succeed in completing the film.</p>
<p>French filmmaker Ferrand lives for movies, he dreaming about his fondest memories of them when he sleeps. He is currently at the Victorine Studios in Nice filming his latest movie "Je vous présente Pamela" - English titled "Meet Pamela" - with production and post-production services handled in Paris. The story is about the recently wedded title character falling mutually in love with her new father-in-law upon first meeting. There are a slew of potential problems in this production. British born Hollywood actress Julie Baker, who portrays Pamela, recently had a nervous breakdown, and as such the film's insurance company will not cover any issues that arise on set because of her. Alphonse, who portrays her husband, is still at an immature stage of his young real life, he who has managed to get his current girlfriend, Liliane, a job as the movie's script girl. In his fragile state of mind, he may be more concerned about what Liliane is up to on set than his own performance. Alexandre, who portrays the father-in-law, also has other things on his mind as he is awaiting the arrival of an unknown someone at Nice Airport, most believing that person being his latest conquest. Séverine, who portrays the mother-in-law, laments her aging movie star status, and thus has taken to drinking on set to calm her nerves. She and Alexandre also had a falling out of sorts during the filming of their last movie together twenty years ago. Stacey, who has a small supporting role as a secretary and who has an iron-clad contract, did not tell Ferrand or any of the production executives that her appearance would be changing as filming progresses, which could be a problem the longer she needs to be on set. And the production manager has allowed the wife of the location manager, Lajoie, on the set as a constant presence as she doesn't trust her husband around all these immoral movie types. As filming progresses, Ferrand's goal of making a great movie may change to his worst nightmare in merely trying to complete a disaster of a movie if these potential problems, and other unforeseen ones, end up rearing their ugly heads.</p>
<p>A film company at work. Actors arrive and depart; liaisons develop. Julie, the beautiful but possibly unstable lead, is recovering from a breakdown, aided by an older physician, her new husband. Alphonse is insecure, he babbles. When his fiance exits with a stunt man, he threatens to quit. Julie must convince him to stay. Alexandre, a consummate pro on the set, runs back and forth to the airport hoping a certain young man will visit. Severine, no longer young, hits the bottle and covers blown lines with emotional outbursts. At the center is Ferrand, the writer director, who must make constant decisions, answer a stream of questions, and deliver the film on schedule.</p>
<p>A committed film director struggles to complete his movie while coping with a myriad of crises, personal and professional, among the cast and crew.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many movies have been made about moviemaking but none surpass Day for Night (La Nuit Américaine) for its humanity, its warmth and its genuine feel for Director François Truffaut's approach to his art and craft.  The film follows Truffaut, in effect playing himself, as he makes a somewhat banal little romance called "Meet Pamela" (Je Vous Présente Pamela) with Jacqueline Bisset, Jean Pierre Aumont, Valentina Cortese (who was nominated for and should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress) and Jean-Pierre Léaud.  It conveys the chaos of filmmaking process in front of and behind the camera and behind the scenes.There are occasional false notes - the production manager's wife who insists on being on the shoot and watches disapprovingly as the cast and crew move in and out of each other's rooms, as funny as she is, simply doesn't ring true to the film - but in so many more cases, the details, the emotions, the mad combination of giddiness, passion and meticulousness that are needed to make a film, are captured so as to make you forget the slightly dated early 70s look.  And Jacqueline Bisset is timelessly stunning in this film.Minor notes:  The movie launched the film career of Nathalie Baye as the continuity girl - her first major role; Graham Greene, the great English novelist (The Quiet American, Brighton Rock, etc.) had an uncredited cameo as the Insurance Agent - Truffaut directed the scene but did not know who the actor was until after the shot was in the can; Maurice Séveno, who appears briefly as a TV reporter, was a well-know French TV news anchor in the 60s and 70s; the score by Georges Delerue, who collaborated on many Truffaut movies, is lovely without being cloying.</p>
