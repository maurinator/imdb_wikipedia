<h1>Mickey One (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After incurring the wrath of the mob, a comic flees Detroit for Chicago taking the name "Mickey One" from a stolen Social Security card from a homeless bum he witnesses being beaten up and robbed. As he returns to the stage and becomes successful, he fears that the mob will track him down. He wishes to square himself with the mob, but doesn't know what he did to anger them or what his debt is.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie for the first time in a film appreciation class and at first I was put off by its style and opaque content.  But I felt compelled to seek out and purchase the laserdisc, and subsequently I enjoy it very much. Basically, Warren Beatty is a nightclub comic on the run from the mob. Along the way there is much symbolism, events which may or may not be hallucinations, and spoken words with double meanings which may or may not be significant.  What makes this movie successful is that very little is 100% clear, and I am actually in the minority who believe that Mickey One's paranoia is indeed justified. An underground film which deserves its cult status, see it if you get the chance.</p>
