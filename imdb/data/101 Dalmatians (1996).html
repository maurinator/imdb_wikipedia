<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>101 DALMATIANS, in my opinion, is an excellent remake of a pure Disney classic. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Pongo and Perdita set out on their mission. If you ask me, Cruella (Glenn Close), Horace (Mark Williams), and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita, I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the production design was beautiful, the performances were top-grade, the direction was flawless, and Disney has done it again. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.</p>
