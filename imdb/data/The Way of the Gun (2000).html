<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>now some of you are wondering what this movie is about. i don't blame you.the title says it all. now usually the title is a cryptic clue, but in this case--it says it all.if you are wondering why devote a film exclusively to gun-play, then ask yourself why devote a summer movie solely to computer special effects.i know most of you are guilty of seeing one of the hot season flicks because your friends said it looked awesome. it's the same motivation for a different audience.i'm an old pro, and let me tell you the action direction in this film is awesome, and i don't use that word often.this film is a gunfight pasted with story, instead of the other way around. and i believe it shows a director who wanted to direct the ultimate action+editing rendition of a running gunfight.i can only say, that if the director and the technical adviser ever read this statement, you have my vote as one of the best, most thrilling and realistic film gunfights ever. thank-you.</p>
