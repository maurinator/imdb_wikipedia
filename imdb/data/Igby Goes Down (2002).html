<h1>Igby Goes Down (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Seventeen year old Jason Slocumb, Jr. - Igby to most that know him - comes from east coast old money, the second son of self-absorbed and controlling Mimi Slocumb and medically-diagnosed schizophrenic Jason Slocum, Sr., the latter who has for several years been institutionalized in a Maryland psychiatric facility. While Igby's economics-studying Columbia-attending older brother Ollie Slocum has embraced and aspires to continue their wealthy life, Igby has rebelled against it, considering his brother a fascist (although he could soften that label to Republican). Because of Jason's situation, Mimi has largely left the role of male role model for Ollie and Igby to their godfather, D.H. Banes. Igby's rebellion has led to him being kicked out of one prep school after another, the latest, a military academy, from which Igby escapes before he can graduate. As such, Mimi and D.H. arrange for Igby to live in New York with Ollie for the summer while working for D.H. renovating some of his properties, before Mimi arranges for yet another strict school for the fall so that Igby can at least graduate. Igby is largely able to hide out for most of the summer with the help of Rachel, D.H.'s younger heroin addict mistress, and Sookie, a slightly older waitress with who he falls in love. An issue with Sookie and the aftermath of a joint mission with Ollie leads to Igby having a clearer picture of what his immediate future will look like.</p>
<p>Igby Goes Down is a personal tale about a 17 year old misfit boy who copes with his mother's cancer and his father's insanity by pursuing relationships with older women. Truly an intellectual, Igby is a modern day Holden Caulfield, and the world he lives in is far removed from the high standards of expectation he holds for it.</p>
<p>Igby Slocumb, a rebellious and sarcastic seventeen year-old boy, is at war with the oppressive world of his East Coast "old money" family. With a schizophrenic father, a self-absorbed, distant mother, and a shark-like young Republican big brother, Igby figures there must be a better life out there, and he sets out to find it. After happily flunking out of several Prep Schools, Igby escapes into the bohemian underworld of Manhattan. His darkly comic trip--shared by a deviant cast of characters, including his terminally bored, part-time lover Sookie, his Godfather's trophy mistress Rachel, and smack-dealing performance artists Russel--veers from bizarre to tragic in Igby's ultimately noble attempt to keep himself from "going down."</p>
<p>A young man's peculiar upbringing renders him unable to competently cope with the struggle of growing up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Igby Goes Down has remnants of Catcher in the Rye, but I don't think that it is precisely in relation to the novel.  First off, while the main character Igby looks on the world with a spiteful, scathing perspective, there are character elements, with him and with the supporting cast, that don't match.  Still, this is not a deterrent to the picture; Kieran Culkin gives a breakout/breakthrough performance as the troubled youth, who has problems with his boarding schools, and his parents (Bill Pullman and Susan Sarandon).  The film has an astute, sarcastic sense of humor that is so subtle that if it doesn't get you to always belly laugh it puts you in a little awe.  Deep down it's a view on the rich, bleak, befuddled lifestyles of not just Igby but of others, and also a compelling character study that doesn't cheat from first frame to last.  Writer/director Steers has created a provocative serio-comedy that gets a great boost from supporting roles from Sarandon (although she's played many mothers before), Pullman, Goldblum, Phillipe, and Claire Danes in a choice pick.</p>
