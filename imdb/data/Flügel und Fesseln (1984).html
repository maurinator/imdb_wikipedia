<h1>Flügel und Fesseln (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Emily, a child, stays with her bourgeois grandparents during frequent periods when her mother makes films. Isabelle wraps a picture, flies to her childhood home to pick up Emily, and plans to leave for her place in France. Old wounds between Isabelle and her parents open around Isabelle's life style. It's also apparent that Isabelle's mother, Paula, is unhappy - with her husband and with her youthful hopes dashed when she became pregnant with Isabelle. Unbeknownst to Isabelle, the co-star of the film she's just made has followed her, checked into a nearby hotel, and wants to begin an affair, even though he's married. Can Isabelle sort it out? What's best for Emily?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After finishing her tiring movie shoot star actress Isabelle flies back to Germany to spend some time with her (much more tiring) daughter who stays with Isabelle's parents. What follows is very reminiscent of Bergman's 'Autumn Sonata', conversations that revel in the generational jealousy and bitterness between Isabelle and her mother. Things that are said at one time (e.g. the parents not approving of Isabelle's lifestyle, especially in regard to men) at other times are revealed to run much deeper.For a while when they both feel particularly lonely (and are a little drunk) they seem to be best friends, and almost behave a little like lovers, talking about their dreams that didn't come true and whatnot. But the harmony doesn't last long and Isabelle gets the blame for the cards that fate dealt the mother and what was love in one minute turns into hate in the other. Like 'Autumn Sonata' it takes its sweet time to get started. The roles here are reversed since the daughter is the successful artist and the mother the devout housewife. With Isabelle having little time to spend with her daughter one can imagine her to grow up to be the Liv Ullmann character and 35 years later she and Isabelle play out the events in 'Autumn Sonata'. Its high points maybe aren't as high as in the Bergman film but I think it's more consistently insightful. And although I compared them a lot 'Flügel und Fesseln' very much stands on its own. If 'Autumn Sonata' is one of your favorite Bergman films this comes recommended.</p>
