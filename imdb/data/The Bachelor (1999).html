<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maybe it was just the theater, or maybe the projector person didn't know what he was doing, but in 75 percent of the scenes the boom mike was just hanging there above people's heads! In the scene on the pond, it looked like the priest was being attacked by a furry bird, and you could see where the actors were going to walk next because the mike was leading the way. It was so bad it was hilarious. Which is good because there wasn't that much else that was funny in this movie. Renee Zellweger shone far above the rest of the cast, Chris O'Donnell still needs to work on his comic timing, and the entire plot was an insult to women. Oh sure, everyone has a wedding dress just sitting around, just in case some stranger wants to marry you with little notice. Overall, a horrible experience. My girlfriend and I fought for the rest of the day.</p>
