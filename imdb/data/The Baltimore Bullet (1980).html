<p>A tale of two hustlers trying to set up a big game.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Baltimore Bullet is the best movie about pool hustlers ever produced. James Coburn is fantastic in a role that should have been nominated for an Oscar. But the absolute best in the film is the script. Great lines, always moving plot, all connected in a clever, funny and intriguing manner. Totally new stuff. (see how much directors and writers seemed to have learned from this one.) Other pool hustler movies were star showcases that gave a weak story at best, Baltimore Bullet racks em up. Anyone who watches this will enjoy the heck out of it, and watch it again, and again - I guarantee it! I just saw this for the first time and had not known it existed. At the screening, the host told us how Dolly Parton had been available for the film but the director disapproved. This should be screened at every Coburn retrospective, and also shown on AMC or TCM network. A great surprise find!</p>
