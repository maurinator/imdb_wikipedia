<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Father Brown visits student Jacob Francis at the family home as Lady Felicia is worried about him. Jacob's father died a year earlier, a presumed suicide, but Jacob is sure that he was murdered and has built a time machine in which he claims he can travel back to prove the case. His other relatives are cynical though his vision of the near future seems to be accurate. But when Jacob also dies Father Brown suspects that his theory was correct and tries out the time machine for himself.</p>
<p>Lady Felicia asks Father Brown to speak to the nephew of a family friend, 22 year-old Jacob Francis, who she describes as manic depressive, obsessive and delusional. The young man's father Frederic died a year ago, an apparent suicide, but Jacob is convinced he was murdered and says he can prove it. Jacob now lives with his aunt and uncle, Georgina and Arnold, and their two daughters, Sarah and Angelica, but spends most of his time in his laboratory working on his time machine. He believes his uncle Arnold killed his father to inherit his half of the estate. After a second death however, it's left to Father Brown to take a spin in Jacob's time machine to identify the killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the story of a boy named Jacob that is very smart. He invents a time machine to go back in time to see who murdered his father.Jacob heard his father argue with his uncle Arnold and not long after that he heard a thud and found his father on the ground in the room with white fluid dripping out of his mouth and a empty bottle of strychnine poisoning. The police put it down as suicide.Jacob believed they fought about the large estate which was under both their names. Jacob's mother was dead and now his father. He has two female cousins that are in race competitions and are constantly pushed by their father to do better. This seems like a very unhappy family.Father Brown is very funny. He sneaks into the time machine room and plays around with it. The machine is electric, that heats up, blows smoke and sends lighting like static through out the room. He is caught by Arnold the sole the owner of the estate and told to leave.Inspector Sullivan gets ticked off by Father Brown because of his nosiness and the ability to solve the crimes with his cleverness and help from his church workers and friends.Funny and suspenseful episode and nice family ending.</p>
