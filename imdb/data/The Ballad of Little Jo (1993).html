<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a true story, this is the tale of Josephine Monaghan, a young woman of the mid-19th century who is thrown out of her parents' home after being seduced by the family's portrait photographer and giving birth to an illegitimate child. Josephine quickly learns that young, female, pretty, and alone are a bad combination for life in the wild west. In her desperation to survive, Josephine disguises herself as "Jo", a young man, and struggles to make a life for herself in a dingy frontier mining town. Can "Little Jo" live and love without revealing his/her secret?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is really a great movie. Believe it or not, I saw it 6 times in 2 days!The performance of Suzy Amis and other actors are really excellent, the music and the photographs are excellent too!I am so exciting to find such a good movie. I feel it unfair that this film hasn't been given enough attention. Again, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen!</p>
