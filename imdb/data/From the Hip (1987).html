<h1>From the Hip (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Apprentice lawyer Robin Weathers turns a civil suit into a headline grabbing charade. He must re-examine his scruples after his shenanigans win him a promotion in his firm, and he must now defend a college professor who is apparently guilty of murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is Bob Clark's cleverist and best film as a writer/director. The casting is superb (especially Judd Nelson and John Hurt), the story is incredibly clever in it's construction (I defy anyone to figure out the ending prior to the final scene !), the humour is very-well inter-woven into a very inticate, and challenging drama. The film really does expose the moral/ethical dilemas faced by a defence attourney, when faced with defending a particularly difficult and vicious murder case. I won't disclose too many details as it would ruin the film, but if you enjoy a thought-provoking yet very funny and hugely entertaining court-room drama..... then WATCH THIS FILM IMMEDIATELY !!!!!!!!!</p>
