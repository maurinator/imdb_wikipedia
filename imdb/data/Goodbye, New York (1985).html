<h1>Goodbye, New York (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young New York woman, devastated to find out that her husband has been cheating on her, decides to hop a plane to Paris to get away. However, she falls asleep on the plane, misses her connection, and winds up in Israel, with no money, no luggage and no friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ditzy comedy--with a become-a-better-you story slant--has flighty Julie Hagerty cast as a wealthy, spoiled American who inadvertently winds up in Israel, broke and homeless. Quickly discovering she'll have to work for the first time in her life, Hagerty learns the meaning of survival, finding friendship along the way. Minor excursion in the wake of "Private Benjamin" is pretty silly. Amos Kolleck wrote, directed and co-stars...and may have been in over his head. The picture isn't overly-ambitious (I didn't detect any hidden agendas), though it could have stood some extra input. Kolleck's writing is spirited in the same sense that most TV sitcoms are spirited, and Hagerty is never encouraged to give her sassy character added dimension or emotional weight. *1/2 from ****</p>
