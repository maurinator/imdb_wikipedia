<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Muqaddar ka Sikandar is and will probably remain one of the greatest movies you and I will ever watch in our lifetime.The drama,pain,suffering,love are some of the things that leave you spell bound.The acting ,the story and suffering of this little boy "sikandar" and how he becomes a feared man in his neighborhood are breath taking.Like all great movies of this golden period,this movie too has a social message -"love the pain and laugh at misery".Once you finish watching the movie you will be overwhelmed and will never forget those haunting moments.like the one where sikandar stays outside the house with the doll,like when his mother dies,the beautiful songs - all breathtaking.And yes , Amitabh Bachchan is Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
