<h1>A Ticklish Affair (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young widow Amy Martin with three young boys is investigated by the Navy after one of her children inadvertently sends out a distress signal in Morse code by the blinds on his upstairs bedroom window. Commander Weedon and crew observe the signal from their ship and investigates. He falls for the young mother and proposes marriage. However, she is reluctant to have her family live out of a suitcase and initially declines. Gramps tries to bring her on board to sail the sea of love with the commander.</p>
<p>Navy widow Amy Martin lives near Halsey Field - a naval base - in San Diego with her three adolescent sons, Luke Martin, Alex Martin and Grover Martin, and Grover's imaginary friend Harrigan. Amy has been around the navy all her life having been a navy brat. Despite missing their brother and son, Amy's nearby sister-in-law and father-in-law, Tandy Martin and Captain Martin, want Amy to move on with her life by getting remarried. They believe their wish for Amy may be realized when she meets Navy Commander Key Wheedon, who is stationed at Halsey Field. The two, attracted to each other, begin dating despite Key stating that he is not the marrying type, and Amy stating that she wants a more stable life for her sons than what a military life offers. Regardless, the two end up falling in love. But when Key announces that he has been assigned to a naval base in Italy, they have to decide if there is indeed a future for them despite their earlier assertions. A plan executed by Grover and Harrigan, with a little unwitting help by Amy's visiting airline pilot brother Cy, may make Amy and Key understand what is best in this situation.</p>
<p>The SOS from the boys upstairs bedroom is made by a Navy Signal Lamp, which was a gift from Uncle Cy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What can only be described as a sweet film, this family comedy is bright and sunny even when the situation takes a turn for the perilous. Full of sprightly performances this is the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore and when it does is drowned in sugary sentiment. The Jones girls, Shirley and Carolyn are both most engaging, play well off each other and look great. In Carolyn's case this might be the most attractive she ever was on screen. As the men in their lives Gig Young get a rare chance to be the romantic lead who doesn't lose the girl in the end performing with his customary charming agility. Red Buttons provides comic relief but his character is more than that and he does it well, he and Carolyn are a surprisingly compatible couple. A film that will leave you charmed at the conclusion this should really be more widely known.</p>
