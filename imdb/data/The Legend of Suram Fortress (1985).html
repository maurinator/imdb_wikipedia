<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Way. Search of essence. This world against faith. Death. And the way is not over. Sacrifice as soul of a city. End of circle. Gift of reconciliation. Result - movie as amber sea.Every wave - part of a ladder. Every beach - skin for ambiguous dreams. Every boat - bridge to understand roots of gestures and happiness. An experience and golden peach. As each film by Paradjanov. Basic truth and force of love. As parts of a fairy tale in which end is more than happy. It is fly of soul, leaf of peace, finish of a long trip, answer to old questions, testimony of innocence and rain for new crops.The death of Zurab is same than Manole's Ana sacrifice. The hero is only crumb of huge bread of saints and ancestors. His body is proof. For motherland love. For God sage, For things who must exist behind particular lives . For lost dramas. A film about religion as reflection of a family history</p>
