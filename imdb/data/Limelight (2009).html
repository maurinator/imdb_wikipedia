<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a musician, so I was interested after the promo, but man it needs some trimming.Overall I liked it, but definitely as a DVR-and-watch-later type of deal. The Zoe and David relationship was good, the Georgia Peech character is just off the wall unbelievable though. Does EVERY series need a whorish blonde girl to be the foil for the spunky brunette lead? Vincent? Wow, what a jerk. Over the top and unbelievable as well, and honestly sabotaging the gala fundraiser was just ridiculous.And to close, what the hell?? CHILD PRODIGY? Don't need it. Doogie Howser called and wants his jacket back.So in short, great concept, wobbly implementation, tighten it up and it'd be really watchable.</p>
