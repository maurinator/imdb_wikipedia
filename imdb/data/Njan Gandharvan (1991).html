<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Njan Gandharvan(I, The Celestial Lover) -Malayalam 1991Last of padmarajan's movie.This is a beautiful fantasy story, filled with magical moments. Many movies were inspired by wim Wender's "Wings of Desire", like City of angels etc.Padmarajan takes a leaf out of Wings of Desire and spins the story around our mythology and legends for this movie.Unlike the other movies where the angels are philosophical and dull, the gandharvan in this movie is a lively character. Padmarajan enriches the scenes of gandharvan with his imagination. When ever he appears there is a feast for your senses. Beautiful visuals, good background music, nice dialogues/songs and the characters talk about how there is a good smell of Palla flower when ever he appears.Cast and Credit: Nitish Bharadwaj .... Gandharvan Suparna .... Bhama M.G. Soman .... Gopalakrishnan Nair Ganesh Kumar .... Pradeep Philomina .... Bhama's Grandmother Vinduja Menon .... Bhama's Sister Thezni Khan ....
