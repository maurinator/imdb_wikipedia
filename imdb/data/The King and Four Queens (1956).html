<h1>The King and Four Queens (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Smooth cowboy Dan Kehoe arrives at a ranch run by an old widow and her four daughters-in-law. He's been tipped off that the proceeds of a gold robbery are hidden on the ranch, but only one of the women knows where. He plays them off against each other in his quest to discover the location.</p>
<p>Opportunistic con man, Dan Kehoe, is on the run when he stops off at a small town saloon and hears stories of the four notorious McDade Brothers. Three of the career outlaws were killed on their last job while one escaped... his identity unknown. Hearing that their $50,000 cache of stolen gold is hidden somewhere on the family ranch at Wagon Mount, Kehoe ignores warnings about their feisty mother, who dislikes visitors and is a crack shot, and ingratiates himself with the old woman with a phony story about meeting her surviving son in a jail cell. He also uses his charm on the four beautiful man-hungry McDade widows, who have stayed with their cantankerous mother-in-law for the past two years - each hoping that her husband is the surviving son and sole claimant to the money. Ma guards her daughter-in-law's chastity as tightly as the hidden gold and soon realizes that with Kehoe, she has let the fox into the henhouse.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Surely stars like CLARK GABLE and ELEANOR PARKER deserved better material at their home studio than this trifle about hidden gold and its effect on The King (Gable struts around like he's just left his throne for some slumming in a western shack), and four Queens (lovely looking ladies who seem out of place in this mock western).It's a light-hearted romp for all concerned, except JO VAN FLEET who gives a dynamo performance as the tough old westerner who is hiding the loot from a bank robbery committed by her now deceased sons. When Gable comes sniffing around to discover the loot (which he endeavors to do by charming the four widows into revealing where the gold is hidden), it sets up a series of mildly suspenseful scenes where we wonder how the whole thing is going to end.Since it's all played in rather tongue-in-cheek style with Gable handling the ladies with his usual masculine charm, it makes a rather faint impression when the tale ends without much of a bang and maybe one or two revelations.Credit has to go to Gable and his co-star ELEANOR PARKER, both of whom share some effective moments in a rather weak tale that comes off as mildly disappointing as they ride off into the sunset together.</p>
