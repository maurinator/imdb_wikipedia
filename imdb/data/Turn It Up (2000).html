<h1>Turn It Up (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Trying to bootstrap his way out of Brooklyn's mean streets is Diamond, a rap musician. With his long-time pal Gage acting as his manager, he's trying to lay down a demo tape with cut-rate studio time. To pay the bills, he and Gage run drugs for "Mr. B." Inside a week, Diamond's beloved mother dies suddenly, his father appears after an absence of 12 years and wants a relationship, and his girlfriend Kia tells him she's pregnant, asking him if he's ready to be a father. Gage steals $100,000 in a multiple-felony robbery so that Diamond can record a full album, not knowing it's Mr. B's money he's taken. B wants his money, Diamond wants his music, Tia wants an answer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a film where you think the hero is a good person, but he usually does some stupid things that in a moral movie woulnd't be redeemable.  But not here.  Pras has a fair performance here as a rap star who wants to make it big, legitimately, but he has to worry about his long time record producer, drug pusher and friend (Ja Rule in a not too bad first role), his father who returned after a 12 year absence and his girlfriend (Tamala Jones) who is pregnant.  A couple of good points on the black music industry (literaly and figuratively) and a couple of stand out performances are cluttered by a lame excuse for a music video plot.  Oh well, I guess you could catch this type of thing here, or somewhere else.  Jason Statham is exceptional though as a british drug dealer, but even he can't help much. C+</p>
