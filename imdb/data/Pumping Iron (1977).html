<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From Gold's Gym in Venice Beach California to the showdown in Pretoria, amateur and professional bodybuilders prepare for the 1975 Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe contests in this part-scripted, part-documentary film.

Sardinian Franco Columbu competes in the lightweight class; at home in Italy he solves a tight parking problem by lifting the car into place. Joe Weider is the marketer; Mike Katz and Ken Waller go for the title of Mr. Universe. Bodybuilding and a celebrity-to-be go mainstream.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Everyone has seen the Austrian Oak's massive body, but "Pumping Iron" reveals the man behind the muscles.  It is a compelling look at one of the most famous American icons in history.  Arnold demonstrates a determination and confidence that has obviously propelled him to the superstar status he obtains today.  The documentary is true and realistic, like all great documentaries of the 70's, and it provides a captivating window into the bodybuilding world.  Although a true story, it manages to be intense and suspenseful during the final rounds of the Mr. Olympia competition.  Will it be Lou Ferrigno or Arnold?  Although most people probably already know the answer, getting to that conclusion is all the fun.  A must see!</p>
