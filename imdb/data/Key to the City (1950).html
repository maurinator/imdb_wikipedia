<h1>Key to the City (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At a mayors convention in San Francisco, ex-longshoreman Steve Fisk meets Clarissa Standish from New England. Fisk is mayor of "Puget City" and is proud of his rough and tumble background. Standish is mayor of "Winona, Maine", and is equally proud of her education and dedication to the people who elected her. Thrown together, the two opposites attract and their escapades during the convention get each of them in hot water back home.</p>
<p>Steve and Clarissa (Clark Gable, Loretta Young) inadvertantly get caught up in shenanigans in a series of adventures during a mayor's convention in San Francisco. Frank Morgan is along to keep it light and fun. Raymond Burr tries to throw a monkey wrench into the works.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ordinary comedy of note more for its cast than any special quality the film itself possesses. Gable and Loretta Young are reunited for the only time after their torrid affair on the set of Call of the Wild resulted in a secret child who was one of Hollywood's most notorious open secrets. This was also Frank Morgan's final completed film, he started work on the disastrous Judy Garland version of Annie Get Your Gun but suffered a heart attack and passed away before the film was restarted with Betty Hutton. As for this picture's story its a bunch of silly nonsense of misunderstandings but the cast give it a game reading and Gable and Young have a good on screen rapport.</p>
