Larry himself has to deal with his ex-wife and his love for his own two kids. Slowly both Beth and the children realise that they have to go on with their lives and that they have been giving a second chance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was the first film i've ever seen that addresses what a man goes through emotionally when dealing with all the ramifications of divorce, separation from his own children and blending families when he enters into a relationship with a woman with children of her own. It deals with what it must be like to assume the role of caretaker in another man's house, with another man's children while someone else is in his former home with his children. Women and children aren't the only ones who have complex feelings when families play musical homes.</p>
