<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this movie. I'm a sucker for movies that remind me of my younger years, and this is definitely one of them (well, seeing as it's made for kids, that's hardly surprising).  The plot was good, the bad guy wasn't scary enough to give younger kids nightmares, but unlikable enough for the slightly older children not the care that he ISN'T too frightening. Wonderful costumes too.Did anyone notice the last name of the Vampires? Sackville-Bagg? It's freakishly close to that of the Sackville-Bagginses from Lord of the Rings...</p>
