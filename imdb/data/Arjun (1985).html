<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Arjun Malvankar after his graduation thrives to get job. The corruption and injustice taking place in his community frustrates him to the extent of revolting with the help of some of his friends. This path of his gets him into serious problems with the law and some outrageous gangsters. He is then taken in by a politician named Shivkumar Chowgule; who not only has pity on him but offers him a job and encourages him. Situations take a different turn one morning engulfing Arjun's life into a world of lies, deceit, crime and politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Malwankar lives a small tenement in Grant Road, Bombay, with his son, Arjun, daughter, Sudha, and wife, Rukmini, who is his second wife, as his first wife perished. Although he is well past his retirement age, he continues to work for an abusive employer, Ashok. Arjun's attempts at seeking employment are all in vain. One day when hoodlums are beating up a man, he intervenes, beats the hoodlums up with the help of half of his friends. This is when his life changes forever. One of his friends', Mohan, is killed; Arjun finds out who the killers are, and kills them in broad daylight; he is arrested, and subsequently released, only to be told by his father that he is no longer welcome. A politician, Shiv Kumar Chougule, takes a liking to Arjun and employs him, and gives him all the support and assistance he needs to fight hoodlums. Arjun now finds he has a mission in life, and is quite content. He meets with Geeta Sahani, and they both fall in love. Then there is a change in the political set-up, which results in Shiv Kumar compromises with the very powers he had undertaken to destroy. Now Arjun has no one to stand behind him and support him, and he may have to take up his fight against Shiv Kumar, or die trying.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Arjun film is written by none other then SALIM JAVED. sorry JAVED AKHTER..... JAVED AKHTER & film director Rahul Rawail, R D BURMAN & SUNNY DEOL has earlier worked together in BETAB. & it was smash hits on box office... BETAB has established RAHUL RAWAIL as a director, SUNNY DEOL as a hero as like his father DHARMENDRA but more important is for JAVED AKHTER, because he was just separated from his professional partner SALIM.(SALIM- JAVED is the only name in Indian cinema history that audience were used to watch a film by their name on poster even audience never care that who is the star & director of the film ) BETAB was a big hit & established four of them... now again they meet together with another refreshing subject somewhere trendiest a original subject..! story,dialogs & script is representing the 80 to 85 period of India...! young generation were surrounding with the unemployment, unstable government,politician & their connection up to university's leader. earlier GULZAR has made film "Mere Apne" on similar kind of subject...! but here JAVED AKHTAR has polished this subject without lost & found formula... with superb script & dialogs...also RAHUL RAWAIL Handel very well...RAM GOPAL VERMA so many time said that his first film SHIVA was a influenced from ARJUN...!ARJUN film has been his primary textbook of learning film making process , both in technically style and story content. this film also established PARESH RAWAL, ANUPAM KHER as actor....! editing is really really sharp... action is also wonderful....Mohan Baghdad done a good job... particular when arjun first meet to RANGA(GOGA KAPOOR) in bar.. also at MATKA where first time he meet Annup Lal (paresh rawal) even in climax, i think this was the most unusual climax action seen of Hindi cinema. at that time i have read some where in film-magazine that after ARJUN film every producer wants Mohan Baghdad in his film to direct their action sequence .. For a music it was not big chance somehow RD BURMAN has done wonderful job, particular in this song MAMAIYAA CARO CARO CARO MAMA....while the film was release bollywood was suffering from video piracy & i saw this film on video & i remember that we were use to see this song again & again... film's background music was fabulous, particular while ARJUN (sunny) was waiting for street DADA at CHAI KI KITALI & then their friends just come out to support him in this seen they just don't speak anything to each other but in background it just whistling...! that sound was fabulous...! even so many film have copied those particular tune & several other tune from this film. after this film's enormous success, this team has continue to work together, in, SAMUNDAR, DACAIT...! but success were bit far... RAHUL RAWAIL & SUNNY have 7 film together..! upcoming director have to learn from this film...! rather then to inspired from Hollywood film or to do copy...! Indian cinema has also have encyclopaedia of creative work...! ARJUN is one of top 100 Indian cinema....</p>
