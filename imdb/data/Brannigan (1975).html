<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Better than average cop movie that compares favorably with "Dirty Harry" and "Sharky's Machine."  Beautiful color DVD transfer in 2.35 : 1. Beautiful photography of locations in London. Jazzy score typical of the '70s. Action fans, crime fans, and John Wayne fans will not be disappointed.</p>
