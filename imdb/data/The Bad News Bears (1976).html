<h1>The Bad News Bears (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>First of a trilogy of films takes an unflinching look at the underbelly of little league baseball in Southern California. Former minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker is a lazy, beer swilling swimming pool cleaner who takes money to coach the Bears, a bunch of disheveled misfits who have virtually no baseball talent. Realizing his dilemma, Coach Buttermaker brings aboard girl pitching ace Amanda Whurlizer, the daughter of a former girlfriend, and Kelly Leak, a motorcycle punk who happens to be the best player around. Brimming with confidence, the Bears look to sweep into the championship game and avenge an earlier loss to their nemesis, the Yankees.</p>
<p>An aging, down-on-his-luck ex-minor leaguer coaches a team of misfits in an ultra-competitive California little league.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I know that is an exaggeration, but I truly believe that this movie sets the standard by which all other "kids and sports" movies will be measured.What it does that is unique is that it keeps the swearing and fighting where it belongs: on the field. This movie does not even try to make anyone look good, for the sake of making them look good.  It just shows the kids at their very essence: booger-eating morons, just out to have a good time trying to play baseball.</p>
