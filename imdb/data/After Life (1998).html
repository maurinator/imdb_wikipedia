<h1>After Life (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After people die, they spend a week with counselors, also dead, who help them pick one memory, the only memory they can take to eternity. They describe the memory to the staff who work with a crew to film it and screen it at week's end; eternity follows. 22 dead arrive that week, assigned to three counselors and a trainee. One old man cannot find a memory, so he watches videotape of his life. Others pick their memory quickly, and the film crew gets right to work. The trainee, 18-year-old Shiori, helps a teenage girl choose a memory other than Disneyland. The youthful staff have a secret and feelings, too, which play out, especially Shiori's affection for her mentor, Mochizuki</p>
<p>Every Monday morning, a team of advisors welcome in a facility a group of people that has just died with the mission of helping each one of them to select their best memory that will last for the eternity in the first three days. On Thursday, filmmakers begin to recreate the selected memory, and in the end of the week they screen it in a movie theater and he or she moves to Heaven.</p>
<p>After death, people have just one week to choose only a memory to keep for eternity.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in the theatre.  It is always a pleasure to be at a viewing where there is spontaneous applause at the end.  This is one of those movies. It speaks to your very soul.  I understand that quite a few of the cast were not professional actors, but spoke from their own lifetime experiences.  There is a very simple premise:  you get to choose the most favourite moment of your life after you are dead and then help to recreate it, staging, cast of characters, scene - and the total non-professional manufacturing of this moment I found very touching - so that it can be savoured for all eternity. The perfect heaven. Of course some recently dead people can't think of anything, some remember very simple things, some are given assistance, like the record of their entire life in video form to review and extract a memory, if they can. The cast and direction is brilliant. I shudder to think of what modern Hollywood would do with this ("What dreams may come" being a case in point).  It was all extremely simple and believable and has certainly had me talking about it for quite a while since I have seen it.  8 out of 10.</p>
