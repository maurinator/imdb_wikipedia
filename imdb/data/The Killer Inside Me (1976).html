<h1>The Killer Inside Me (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Everyone figures Lou Ford, a small-town, Montana, deputy sheriff, to be a normal, good-old-boy kind of regular Joe. But no one knows about "the sickness" that drives him to kill.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This isn't a waste of time, nor is it one to fervently hunt for. It certainly could have done better for the brilliant author, Jim Thompson, and talented star Stacy Keach.One problem is the slow development. It takes seemingly forever to get into the schizophrenic aspects of the character. I have seen films where such slow development is well handled with skillful forewarning of what is to come. Unfortunately, that's not the case here.Veteran actors, Keenan Wynn, Royal Dano, and John Carradine show up here and buffs might find it worth watching this just to see their appearances.All in all, it's an okay movie, but don't risk breaking your neck to see it...it's not worth it, pal.</p>
