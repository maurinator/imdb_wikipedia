<h1>Turtle Diary (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two separate people, a man and a woman, find something very stirring about the sea turtles in their tank at the London Zoo. They meet and form an odd, but sympathetic camaraderie as they plan to steal two of the turtles and free them into the ocean.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Turtle Diary" tells a preposterous -- even silly -- story but is saved by great  performances, an evocative score, and consistent good humor.  There has never been a  more commanding screen presence than Glenda Jackson.  What a shame it is that she  has deprived us of her formidable talent in order to become a minor league politician.    Ben Kingsley is also wonderful.  `Turtle Diary' calls for patience but those who exercise it  will be well rewarded.  7 out of 10.</p>
