<h1>Ossos (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The first film in Pedro Costa's transformative trilogy about Fontainhas, an impoverished quarter of Lisbon, Ossos is a tale of young lives torn apart by desperation. After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby's safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L'argent), Ossos is a haunting look at a devastated community.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this is one unique film form Portuguese director Pedro Costa.it's a film that definitely requires more than one viewing in order to fully understand it.i liked it,but there's no doubt it's challenging.however,that just makes the experience more rewarding once we do comprehend what it is we have witnessed.as for this movie,though i didn't completely grasp the meaning of it all,i did like the look and the atmosphere of it.colours were used to very good effect.dialogue is used very sparingly here,and that works in the film's favour as well.keep in mind going in,this a movie that will challenge you and make you use your mind.if you're not wiling to be engaged mentally,this isn't your film.</p>
