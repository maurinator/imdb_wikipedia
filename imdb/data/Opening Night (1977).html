<h1>Opening Night (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young woman gets killed in an accident trying to meet her favorite actress Myrtle Gordon after a play. Then Myrtle Gordon felt responsible for the killing leading her down to an emotional crisis that interferes with her professional work as an actress.</p>
<p>Renowned actress Myrtle Gordon is in final out-of-town rehearsals in New Haven, Connecticut for her latest play, The Second Woman, before it begins its Broadway run. Myrtle, through her behavior, is causing problems for those involved with the show, including: her fellow actors, especially her leading man, Maurice Aarons, a former lover; the director, Manny Victor, who is facing issues of his own in what is only the latest in a string of marital problems with wife, Dorothy; playwright Sarah Goode; and producer David Samuels. The problem is that Myrtle says that she cannot relate to the play and the plight of her character, a woman dealing with the loss of her youth. In reality, middle aged Myrtle is seemingly unwilling to admit that she too is getting old, something that sixty-five year old Sarah seems content with about her own life. Myrtle's erratic behavior is exacerbated by her excessive drinking. Things take a further downward spiral when Myrtle, among others, witnesses the accidental death outside of the theater of one of her adoring fans, seventeen year old Nancy Stein. Following, Myrtle begins to see visions of Nancy. She states that she can turn these visions of Nancy on and off - that the visions are things she can use for the play, as to her Nancy represents the hopes and dreams of the first "younger" woman - but she, deep in her heart, knows the visions are so much more and things that she cannot control. Will Myrtle be able to take control of her life, what is represented in the play, by opening night?</p>
<p>An actress suffers an emotional uproar in her personal life after a fan dies trying to see her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Opening Night is *such* a fun movie to watch.  John Cassavetes was smack dab in the middle of his stride as a director, having completed A Woman Under The Influence (his watershed picture, a hugely intense, absolutely fantastic movie that manages to zone almost completely on nothing but individual human emotions - fear, love, self-doubt) and The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (an awesome awesome awesome movie with Ben Gazzara where he's working for and running from the mafia around Los Angeles, incredible, resonant, mostly handheld cinematography that places emphasis on human faces and a script that is full of realistic dialogue - probably because the film is heavily improvised) just before this.  What it's all about is a middle-aged actress whose overriding insecurities as a human being are drawn to the surface by a single incident:  the accidental death of an adoring, enigmatic fan.  As she muddles her way through previews of her upcoming Broadway play 'Second Woman' (of which she is the star), her health -- mental and otherwise -- begins to deteriorate.  She just can't get it together, and an unsympathetic (and when they feign sympathy and support, they're unbelievable) cast of supporters doesn't help matters.  She drinks and drinks and drinks and falls down some and messes up a lot.  Will she get it together in time for Opening Night?Underneath this, John Cassavetes stages and films various scenes of the fictitious play in front of an actual audience, aware of the film cameras filming a movie or not.  In that sense, these bits of the film are incredibly interesting.  John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands share unmatched chemistry on stage, being that they were one of the most in-love couples in the annals of film history, and it shows.  Cassavetes reminds me you of his dynamite ability as a nuanced, fun-to-watch character actor, and Gena Rowlands reminds you of why she's believable as an adored, successful stage actress.  These are somewhat arcane stage performances, but are delightful. What is wrong with Opening Night?  It's a movie for people who love movies, with long takes, memorable camera moves, first rate acting, high-concept ideas, a solid beginning middle and end, a great score, and a central theme that is very compelling.  Some of Cassavetes' best work, a real brawny film, tall and beautiful, heavily recommended to people who are sick of cotton candy movies, sick of feature-length trailers, sick of all the crap.  If you want a thick, expansive thing, Opening Night sits on the shelf, waiting.</p>
