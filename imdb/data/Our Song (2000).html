<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters.  It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best).  The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.All in all, a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.</p>
