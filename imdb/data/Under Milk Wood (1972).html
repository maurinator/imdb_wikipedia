<h1>Under Milk Wood (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is a delightful if peculiar story of a day in the life of a small, Welsh fishing village called "Llareggub" (read it backwards). We meet a host of curious characters (and ghosts) through the 'eyes' of Blind Captain cat. This is a true "Classic" of modern British writing with a wonderful, mischievous use of language.</p>
<p>One night while the townsfolk wrestle with their dreams, seedy Captain Cat and a stranger walk the streets. Captain Cat is a blind, retired sea captain, recalling memories of drowned shipmates and Rosie Probert, a whore and the one great love of his youth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film of rare magic. This little known but top-notch production is whimsical, thoroughly engaging, and delicately controlled.The atmosphere is consistent throughout, with universal types exaggeratedly peopling and animating a small Welsh seaside town.This is as close as any British film has come to creating a Fellini-like mood.Narrative lyricism overpowers any actor's personal performance, though Peter O'Toole excels as Captain Cat. Glynnis Johns's performance also stands out, as do those of a motley mix of more minor characters.Over it all, Richard Burton's driving cadences worthily guide Thomas's verse to an eccentric and vibrant cinematic life. Thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
