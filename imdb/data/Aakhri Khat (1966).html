<h1>Aakhri Khat (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It was in scenic Kulu that Govind Bali had first met Lajoo, both fell in love, got married secretly in a temple and parted company. When Lajoo becomes pregnant, her step-mother sells her to a male for 500 Rupees, where she is beaten and thrown out. She goes to Govind, who is on the verge of going to America, who refuses to believe that the child is his. Lajoo writes a letter informing him that she will never see him again. Govind re-locates to Bombay where he starts his own business, and makes a sculptor of Lajoo. She writes to him from Amritsar when she gives birth to Buntu her son. She again writes to him from Delhi when he begins to walk, and yet another letter when he begins to talk. The last two letters that Govind receives inform him that Lajoo and Buntu are now in Bombay, that Lajoo is seriously ill and may not live long. Shortly thereafter Govind goes to the Police, meets with a skeptical Inspector Naik, and a few days later he is asked to identify Lajoo's lifeless body found on the beach. Then the search begins for Buntu, who is only 15 months old, no one know what he looks like, and whether he is still alive or not. How can Govind and the Police ever locate a child, in a city of millions of similar-aged children, and if at all they do, how can they positively identify him as Govind's child?</p>
<p>A wake up call to politicians in the Indian government</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although, this is the debut film of Rajesh Khanna who was offered the role by winning the finalist position in the All India Talent Contest held in 1965 by Film Fare and United Producers. But it was essentially the wonderful real/natural acting of the child star - Bantu who steals the show by his extremely innocent and pretty demeanor. Bantu is the real protagonist instead of his father, Govind played by Rajesh Khanna.The song number "Aye baharo mera jeevan bhi sawaro....." is superbly sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The script by Chetan Anand renders purpose and meaning to the story while music by Khayyam adds suspenseful rhythm to its sentimental flow of events. A really nice art movie of the yore worthy to be awarded the Academy Award in Best Foreign Film category.</p>
