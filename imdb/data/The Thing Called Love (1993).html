<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is very good, it is straight and honest and true on human feelings as is miles away from the stereotyped musical comedies. Watching it is just a breath of fresh air.The music is very good, the acting ranges form good to excellent, and director Bogdanovich displays real class touch in some scenes. Bogdanovich is very good at directing young actors, as it was very clear since his "Last Picture Show" movie of the early 70s.The actors: Phoenix doesn't do much real acting but his presence has something magnetic to it and it's a real shame that he passed away, he would have become one of the greatest actors of today. Mathis is fresh, unmannered and straight, a real girl not a stereotype. At last! You can't say she's beautiful or sexy but man she has presence and personality, you can't but fall in love with her. Bullock plays the ingenue and she does it very well, even in this early movie she displays the acting qualities she became much appreciated for afterwards.It is a real shame that "The Thing Called Love" hasn't been released on DVD yet. Paramount announced an October 26th, 2004 release which didn't happen. This must be a cruel joke as it's years that we are waiting for this release. Paramount executives, if you read this, please deliver this movie on DVD. I am sure that you won't regret it.</p>
