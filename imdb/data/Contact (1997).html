<h1>Contact (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway has long been interested in contact to faraway lands, a love fostered in her childhood by her father, Ted Arroway, who passed away when she was nine years old leaving her then orphaned. Her current work in monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) was pulled on her work, which is referred to some, including her NSF superior David Drumlin, as more science fiction than science, Ellie, with a few of her rogue scientist colleagues, have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work. When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military, religious leaders and other scientists such as Drumlin, try to take over her work. When the messages received from space are decoded, the project takes on a whole new dimension, which strengthens for Ellie the quest for the truth. Thrown into the mix are the unknown person who has up until now funded most of Ellie's work and what his motivations are, and Palmer Joss, a renowned author and theologian, who despite their fundamental differences in outlook, is mutually attracted to Ellie, that attraction based in part on intellect and their common goal of wanting to know the truth.</p>
<p>The skeptical scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway researches extraterrestrial life with her team in Puerto Rico. When David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) shuts-down the project, Ellie seeks for private funds to reopen her research in New Mexico. An anonymous millionaire provides the necessary funds and Ellie proceeds with her work. Four years later, she is contacted by alien forms from Vega that send a coded message. The millionaire S.R. Hadden that is financing the research deciphers the message and gives to Ellie the design of an intriguing machine. Ellie concludes that the equipment might be to transport a passenger to Vega. Now she needs to convince a commission formed by military, politicians, scientists and religious leaders that she is the best candidate for the journey.</p>
<p>Contact is the story of a free thinking radio astronomer who discovers an intelligent signal broadcast from deep space. She and her fellow scientists are able to decipher the Message and discover detailed instructions for building a mysterious Machine. Will the Machine spell the end of our world, or the end of our superstitions? Will we take our place among the races of the Galaxy, or are we just an upstart species with a long way to go?</p>
<p>Dr. Eleanor Arroway has spent her life searching for truth in the study of radio astronomy. Palmer Joss has spent his searching for truth through faith in God. When Ellie discovers a stunning message from an extraterrestrial intelligence, they and everyone on Earth will be forced to challenge their own assumptions. In the inevitable first contact, will humankind be able to find a compromise between science and belief?</p>
<p>Dr. Ellie Arroway, after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of intelligent aliens, who send plans for a mysterious machine.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am used to hearing from just about everyone who has read a book that was made into a movie that the book is always better.  I tend to agree with this opinion.  Contact, however, shows that in the arts the norm is not always the truth; opinion, no matter how often it is backed up with evidence, can never break through the barrier into be a hardened and absolute truth.I saw this movie first before I read the book.  That is partly because I didn't know that there was the book until after the movie.  So, a year or so after the viewing, I got the book.  Of course, the movie, in general terms, follows the book fairly well.  I have to say, the movie can easily stand on its own merits just as the book can also.The immediate impression of the film after the book is that there is a great emphasis on faith, proof, truth and opinion.  These themes are not much brought up in the book - at least not with the same impact nor in the same way as in the film.  Of course, the field of Astrophysics, of which Carl Sagan was a practitioner, lends itself very easily to ultimate questions such as God, faith, truth etc.  The vastness of space and complexity of reality, viewed through the scrutiny of the scientific eye, is mind-boggling.  As was repeated in the movie several times: "if we're all that there is, "its an awful waste of space."  Personally, I think that the book relates these notions of vastness and complexity much better than the movie.  But, the audience of the book was certainly not necessarily the same audience as the movie.To be more fair, the vastness which was expressed in the book was demonstrated to an equal degree, but differed in quality, by the "aloneness" of Dr. Arroway as she scuttles across the universe.  In the book, Dr. Arroway is not alone but go with a team of scientists, all of whom make their appearance in the movie.  There is much more detail given in the book of the trip through the device than in the movie.  In fact, there are very deliberate omissions made which eliminate the technological bent of the book.  Yet, the focus of the movie does not allow the movie to be diminished by these omissions in the same way that the book would unavoidably be lacking without those details.One final aspect of the movie which is relevant with respect to the book is time.  Of course, in physics, time has its leading role so it must make at least a cameo in a movie which relies on physics.  Astrophysics is tied inextricably to relativity which is likewise tied to time.  The timelessness of the device design sent via radio signals and the instantaneous trip Dr. Arroway seemed to put relativity into perfect perspective.  The book takes a slightly different view by using distance and the experience of each traveler of moving fast distances with no other apparent sensations of motion.  It all adds up to different but equal expressions of the science which Carl Sagan had mastered.Both the book and the movie are simply fantastic, one not outshining the other as regards their scope and vision.  Watch the film, it is a beautiful one.  Read the book, it is equally beautiful.</p>
