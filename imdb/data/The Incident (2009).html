<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this episode is the best and most hilarious episode of the series so far I mean come on , watch it then you will agree with me more because the moment this episode begins the more funny things will begin too and go download this episode by torrent or by whatever just download it because I guarantee you won't be regretted and also for those who have watched Cheers in the 80s will like this episode even more because Shelley Long have guest starred in it as DeDe Pritchett and her performance was praised by critics and in my opinion this episode should be nominated for Emmy for outstanding directing episode because it was unbelievably incredible and the song that Dylan was singing with his guitar was good and funny too . I'd give the episode 9.8/10 .</p>
