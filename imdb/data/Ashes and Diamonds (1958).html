<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ashes and Diamonds is the film I have seen at least 15 times in my youth. I know it by heart as I was deeply impressed by the dilemma it depicts. Maciek remains for me the hero of illusions and disillusion. The small hotel of the film will be allways the scenery of personal and historical fate and the last scene will sum up for me always the eternal question of "quo vadis?"</p>
