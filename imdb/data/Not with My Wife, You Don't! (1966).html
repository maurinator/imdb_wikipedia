<h1>Not with My Wife, You Don't! (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the Korean War, Italian nurse Virna Lisi falls in love with two American fliers, Tony Curtis and George C. Scott. Lisi marries Curtis after he convinces her that Scott has been killed in a plane crash. She soon discovers Scott is alive, but remains happily married to Curtis until Scott re-enters their lives 14 years later.</p>
<p>Air Force Colonel Tom Ferris seems to have the perfect life. The assistant attaché to a general, he is extremely efficient at his job, is well respected and thus is in line for a big promotion, and has been married for fourteen years to a beautiful wife, the former Lieutenant Julietta Perodi, who he met when she was a military nurse. However, their marriage is not perfect as Julie is feeling neglected, being in her mind the second priority in Tom's life after his job and career advancement. Tom's home life is threatened when into their lives returns Colonel Tank Martin, who Tom and Julie have not seen since before their wedding. Tank and Tom were fellow fighter pilots during the Korean War and rivals for the affections of women, including Julie, who would admit to loving both men at the time. Julie ended up with Tom instead of Tank in part because of some destroyed information. Tank and Tom played games of one-upsmanship when it came to getting the girl, these games which may start up all over again when it comes to winning Julie for good.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Korean War buddies Tony Curtis (as Tom) and George C. Scott (as Tank) would rather fight over blonde Italian beauty Virna Lisi (as Julie). She likes to have two of everything, but Ms. Lisi can't juggle two contentious colonels. Lisi marries Mr. Curtis, but since he won her deceptively, she may decide to hook up with Mr. Scott. Naturally, Mr. Curtis thinks, "Not with My Wife, You Don't!" After Bob Hope's cameo, it occurred to me that if they were 20 years younger, Mr. Hope and Bing Crosby might have starred in this film. Hope would play "Tom" and Mr. Crosby would be perfect as "Tank"; of course, somehow both Hope and Crosby would be sent snow-sledding to Labrador. Now, who would win Virna Lisi is debatable. Well, flash-forward to director Norman Panama's present The actors have a few good moments, like Curtis trying show Scott he's temporarily gone blind, in an early hospital scene. And, later in the running time, watch for the very best part of the movie, with Scott and Curtis joining Lisi in a black-and-white Italian movie spoof - if only the entire movie were as good as this scene. Most prophetic line: Curtis, in Arab drag, says "Let's get the Shah on the road." **** Not with My Wife, You Don't! (11/2/66) Norman Panama ~ Tony Curtis, George C. Scott, Virna Lisi</p>
