<h1>Kolya (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Franta Louka is a concert cellist in Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia, a confirmed bachelor and a lady's man. Having lost his place in the state orchestra, he must make ends meet by playing at funerals and painting tombstones. But he has run up a large debt, and when his friend, the grave-digger Mr. Broz, suggests a scheme for making a lot of money by marrying a Russian woman so that she can get her Czech papers, he reluctantly agrees. She takes advantage of the situation to emigrate to West Germany, to her lover; and leaves her five-year-old son with his grandmother; when the grandmother dies, Kolya must come and live with his stepfather - Louka.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kolya combines a big, pulsating heart with a wide range of visual creativity. It is touching, it will make you weep. But the tears that you shed aren't cheap. They don't flow from your eyes because of average schmaltz. This is a genuine masterpiece full of emotions, and Sverak has a fingerspitzen-gef√ºhl that makes him a master filmmaker.</p>
