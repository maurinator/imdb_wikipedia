<h1>The Fog (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As the centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay, California approaches, paranormal activity begins to occur at midnight. 100 years ago, the wealthy leper Blake bought the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane and sailed with his people to form a leper colony. However, while sailing through a thick fog, they were deliberately misguided by a campfire onshore, steering the course of the ship toward the light and crashing her against the rocks. While the town's residents prepare to celebrate, the victims of this heinous crime that the town's founders committed rise from the sea to claim retribution. Under cover of the ominous glowing fog, they carry out their vicious attacks, searching for what is rightly theirs.</p>
<p>The centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay, California has arrived, though the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town's residents. A conspiracy led by the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a terrible shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that she would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use the fortune to build the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a thick fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the campfire onshore. Now the ominous glowing fog that led them to their doom has returned, bringing with it the ghosts of the crew as they seek revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay.</p>
<p>Legend says that Antonio Bay was built in 1880 with blood money obtained from shipwrecked lepers which no one believes. On the eve of the town's centennial, many plan to attend the celebrations, including the murdered lepers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Houseman sits around a campfire telling children about the story of a ship that went down near their home Antonio Bay and how the drowned sailors will reappear 100 years to that very night in the fog.  It is a wonderful beginning to a very chilling film, directed by the modern horror meister John Carpenter.  As with most of his films, Carpenter creates a scary atmosphere through moody settings(the California coastline, a lighthouse, an old Church), relentless mood music as in Halloween, good character acting(Holbrook, Houseman, Curtis, Leigh), and a claustrophobic feeling of something vice-like gripping you.  The story has some plot problems, but none enough to detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.  Adrienne Barbeau is as lovely as ever in the lead, and the film is credible amidst the background of supernatural actions.</p>
