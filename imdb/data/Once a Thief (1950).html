<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>1950's "Once a Thief..." is enhanced by its low budget status, populated by small time chiselers and hoods, and the women who fall for them. Top billing goes to Cesar Romero as Mitch Moore, the same kind of cad role he'd been playing since his film debut in 1934's "The Thin Man." June Havoc, younger sister of Gypsy Rose Lee, is the latest moll to fall for his charms, after doing time for petty theft (she soon gave up an unspectacular movie career for the stage and television). Lon Chaney is a pleasant surprise as Gus, who runs a gambling den behind a dry cleaners, who may be a crook but has the heart that others lack. Still echoing his lovable Lennie from "Of Mice and Men," and yet another example of how his career continuously received a boost from his typecasting. The girls who aren't jailed wind up dead; alas, Marie 'The Body' McDonald, in one of her last roles, committed suicide at 42 in 1965, her tabloid coverage far greater than any of her movies. It's an honestly gritty title from director W. Lee Wilder, older brother of Billy Wilder, whose films are mostly guilty...of boring the audience.</p>
