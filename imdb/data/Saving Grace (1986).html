<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Talk about sleeper movies, this is one. It is a totally watchable movie with great acting, etc, (you don't have to be Catholic to enjoy). The description is enough to turn off most people, but persevere it is not a movie that beats you over the head with religion. If you are looking for car chases, or zombies, or naked women, this is not the movie for you. But if you are looking for absolute entertainment and a good ending please watch it and enjoy!
