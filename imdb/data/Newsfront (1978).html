<h1>Newsfront (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Surprisingly adventurous saga of an intrepid group of cinematographers and reporters who risk life and limb to capture footage of breaking news for the movie-going public.</p>
<p>In post war Australia the men and women of Cinetone struggle to produce the weekly news reels for the movie going public.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s, I can readily identify with the content of this fine film. Each week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street to watch the Cinesound (and usually 3 Stooges) shorts. Never has there been a better blending of B/W and colour in a film. Faultless production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience.</p>
