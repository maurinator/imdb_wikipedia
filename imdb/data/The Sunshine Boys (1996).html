<h1>The Sunshine Boys (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Neil Simon wrote this updated version of his 1972 Broadway play about a film agent's efforts to recombine the once famous comedy pair Lewis and Clark, played by Woody Allen and Peter Falk.</p>
<p>Remake of Neil Simon's play was filmed in 1995, but held on the shelf until it was finally shown on tv over the Christmas holidays in 1997. Falk surprisingly takes on the role of the neurotic show biz partner who is a constant pain in the side of his former comedic teammate (Allen) and everyone else who surrounds him by doing what he thinks is funny despite other direction.</p>
<p>Two aging comedians who acrimoniously dissolved their act eight years earlier must overcome their differences when they have the chance for a lucrative movie comeback.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A delightful view into the lives of legends lost.  It has heart and soul.  Besides the lines being hilarious, it is funny just to look at Allen and Falk together.If you enjoy woody's acting and simon's writing then definitely check this one out.</p>
