<h1>Baby Geniuses (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Elena Kinder and Dr. Heap work for BABYCO, the world's leading manufacturer in baby products. What the public doesn't know, however, is that Dr. Kinder and Dr. Heap are secretly working on cracking the code to "baby talk" which is actually a highly sophisticated language which allows babies to communicate the knowledge of the secrets of the universe with which they are born. Problems arise when Sly, the smartest of the babies, escapes from the lab and unites the babies of the outside world to help free the babies trapped in the lab. Kinder and Heap must find Sly before it is too late.</p>
<p>Two scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder and Dr. Heep use genius baby studies to fund their Babyco theme park. At age two, the children are due to 'cross over', learn to talk, and forget their universal knowledge. One mischievous toddler, Sly, makes repeated attempts to escape the "Kinder" lab and one night, he actually succeeds. What Sly does not expect is to run into his twin, Whit, in a mall playground. Although Sly and Whit share a telepathic bond, they have no idea of each other's existence. When the guards from the lab capture Whit, mistaken him for Sly, and take him back to the Kinder lab, Sly is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, who has mistaken him for Whit.</p>
<p>Scientist hold talking, super-intelligent babies captive, but things take a turn for the worse when a mix-up occurs between a baby genius and its twin.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For those not initiated in the BG Fanclub, Baby Geniuses is one of the best movies ever filmed since the invention of motion pictures. Shunned by certain members of the Academy in 1999, Baby Geniuses failed to be nominated for any Oscars due to too many dried up, haggard, pro-choice members who were terrified of the children in this film. Otherwise, this movie would have been awarded the highest honors for its superb acting, special effects, direction, and choreography. "Puttin' on the Ritz" anyone? One day, like Citizen Kane, this movie will be respected for the absolute genius it is and take its place as best movie ever. Suck on that, Ebert.</p>
