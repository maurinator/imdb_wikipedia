<h1>Boardwalk (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this drama, David Rosen and his wife Becky have lived in the same Coney Island neighborhood for nearly all their married life. But the area is not what it used to be, and a gang leader named Strut has decided to make Coney Island his new turf. Strut begins shaking down the merchants in the area, demanding payment for "protection" and using violence to deal with anyone who gets in his way. David refuses to give Strut protection money for the restaurant he owns, and as a result his diner is soon firebombed, while many of his neighbors are attacked and his synagogue is desecrated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Boardwalk" is what I would call a blessed movie. It is blessed with a cast that simply excels. Ruth Gordon and Lee Strasberg as David and Becky Rosen work together like they have been married fifty years, even though it's just in the movie. This is Lee Strasberg's opportunity to make an acting statement and he does so with a huge exclamation point. I also must mention that "Boardwalk" is one of the most effectively edited films I have ever seen. What may seem abrupt to some is in reality moving things along, otherwise you would have a story that might be too long. The Coney Island locations are another plus, remembering in this wonderful film a bygone era. All I can say is see this movie, and don't forget to bring plenty of tissues. - MERK</p>
