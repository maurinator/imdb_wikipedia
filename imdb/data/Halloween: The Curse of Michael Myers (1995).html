<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is one of the best ones in the series. I also liked Halloween: Resurrection, and Halloween H20. This one is one of my favorites. It is more my cup of tea than Halloween 5 was. I liked this one better. Joe Chappelle, the director of the brilliant Phantoms did a really good job, I thought so. The guys who play Michael Myers are always big and scary, just like a boogeyman. This movie also had plenty of gore, which is a horror lover's festival. The acting was okay, and the first time actors in this movie did well for their first big screen performance. The storyline didn't weaken hardly at all. The plot was good and thick, and there was so much going on in this movie helping to tell this story. When you see the beginning of the film, you won't understand it instantly, so don't think your watching the wrong movie. It is a little confusing at the beginning, until the story moves on about ten minutes after the opening sequence. Then everything begins to come together. To me, the movie didn't seem very long, I mean it was only 88 minutes, but still, it seemed really short. I also recommend Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers. If you want to se a seriously fun, entertaining, scary, and good horror movie, surely see it. I give Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers a 10 out of 10! :)</p>
