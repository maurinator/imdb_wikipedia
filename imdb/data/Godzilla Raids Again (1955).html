Soon, the two monsters arrive in Osaka where they resume their battle. Will the two monsters destroy Osaka before they ultimately destroy each other?</p>
<p>Godzilla battles an irradiated Ankylosaur and destroys Osaka in the process.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Picked up the remastered version recently released. It has the Japanese and American versions of the film. I watched the longer Japanese version which is oh so much better. Gone is the stupid narration. The voices actually match the characters and don't come off dopey. There are also scenes with silences, something the American version seemed afraid to have. I used to think this was a dull and boring film, but it actually held my attention this time out, even when my brother was kibitzing to get me to go shopping with him. If you like these sort of movies and get the chance watch this in Japanese and see it for the first time. (FYI- the new remasters do not allow toggling between versions because the Japanese versions are usually longer, even by a minute or two than the Americans so you can only see the differences by watching the versions back to back.)</p>
