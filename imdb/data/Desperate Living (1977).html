<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Waters never apologizes for his movies- and this one is both funny and disgusting.  Mink Stole as the hysteric and Miss Edie as the queen are both off the wall good.  Waters doesn't shy away from nudity- both male and female-- but it all works to make this a hilarious spoof.</p>
