<h1>Red Kiss (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>1952, Paris. Nadia, a Red Diaper baby, has a sister, Polish parents, and at 15 is an active Communist. When cops beat her during an anti-American demonstration, she's rescued by a "Match" photographer. As the friendship becomes a love affair and her slogans are tested by new knowledge and emotion, some of the Red youth want to expel her. When she goes with Stéphane to a seaside photo shoot, her father goes to the police. Stéphane faces charges, so leaving to cover the war in Indochina looks appealing. In a parallel story, Nadia's mother meets again her prewar lover, released from Siberia, who challenges the French Reds with very real scars and word of Stalin's anti-Semitism.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie. I saw it in the theater when it first came out. I have not seen the film since 1985 when it first came out, but I have often thought about it. I was very young when I saw it and it made me think about the period in France after WWII in which they became enamoured with Stalin (hence the title Red Kiss). I recall some of the conflicts integral to the storyline dealt with a young French women's wrestling of the "rosy" ideals of Stalinism and coming to terms with the evidence of his atrocities.It's crazy that there is no DVD out yet after all this time. If this came out on DVD, I'd buy a copy for each of my friends for Xmas. It won the prize at the Berlin film festival for crying out loud. I know its out on VHS and the Amazon sells it, but I don't really use VHS anymore.</p>
