<h1>Track 29 (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A doctor's wife tires of his obsession with model trains, and spends her days wondering about the son she gave up for adoption at birth. While eating at a roadside cafe, she encounters a British hitchhiker, who turns out to be her son. They spend time together trying to find a bond. The son begins to hate the husband, and the wife begins worrying about the safety of her husband and his train set.</p>
<p>For this psychological drama, Dennis Potter reworked his 1974 TV play, Schmoedipus, transposing the setting from London to the United States. The title "Track 29" is taken from the lyrics of "Chattanooga Choo Choo." Distraught and dreamy Linda Henry complains to her husband, surgeon Henry Henry, about their sex-less, childless marriage, but he's obsessed with his basement model railroad layout and also engaged in an affair with a nurse. When mysterious stranger Martin drops in on Linda, he claims to be her long-lost illegitimate son. As seen in flashbacks, the 16-year-old Linda was raped at a carnival by a man who resembles Martin. Subsequent events hint at Martin as a delusion, a product erupting from Linda's fantasy world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A young man is going around provincial USA searching for his mother that he never saw. As soon as he was born his young and careless parents sent him to mental hospital. Now Gary Oldman is free to go so he decides to find his mother, the one he was missing all those mental hospital days. His mother Linda (Theresa Russell) lives in American dream but doesn't seem to be happy. Her husband is fond of collecting railways for children. Sure, he has one of the largest railway-toy system in the whole state. He is proud of his railway model and pays more attention to his railway-world than to his young wife. Who used to have some nasty experiences before became a noble woman. But all that world is just smashed by the coming of that crazy son, who wants the revenge for such unhappy childhood. Finally Mummy lets her successful husband to meet her naughty son. Great, rather cynic, cold black humour film. www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab</p>
