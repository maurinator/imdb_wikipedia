<h1>The Claim (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A prospector sells his wife and daughter to another gold miner for the rights to a gold mine. Twenty years later, the prospector is a wealthy man who owns much of the old west town named Kingdom Come. But changes are brewing and his past is coming back to haunt him. A surveyor and his crew scout the town as a location for a new railroad line and a young woman suddenly appears in the town and is evidently the man's daughter.</p>
<p>Based on Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, The Claim follows the story of Daniel Dillon, who traded his wife and newborn daughter for a gold mine. 20 years later he is thrown into a kind of hell in the prospecting city he controls is being surveyed as potential railroad route and the wife and daughter that he hocked for his riches show up as well.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have been following this director for a while and I always liked his films but this time he has exceeded my expectations.'The Claim' is like an ancient greek tragedy and Dillon is its' hero. Dillon is a man who goes West with his wife and new born daughter in order to find gold.  In the process he sells his wife and his daughter in exchange for that gold.   Years later his wife will come back to haunt him and Dillon comes to realize how empty his life has been, how irrelevant wealth can be to happiness.  The story is so beautifully told and the last scene where the people of the new city of Lisboa prey on Dillon's gold is a metaphor or at least I would like it to be. I think Winterbottom wanted to show how the world will never change, how people will continue to go after that gold.  Dillon came and went, but he didn't leave anything behind him.  He achieved all those things, he was a pioneer he went out West, he was one of the people who built America but he didn't win his daughter's heart.  And it makes one wonder, what was the point of his life. 'The Claim' is the story of America itself, an America that was built on greed, on the quest for new lands, new conquers and prosperity. Peter Mullan gives us an excellent performance, as well as Sarah Polley as the elegant young daughter and Milla Jovovich. Nastasia Kinsky has a rather insignificant role and Wes Bentley is disappointing. Overall, a very good film, a piece of art by Winterbottom and a story that you won't forget for a while.</p>
