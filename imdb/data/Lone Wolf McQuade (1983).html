<h1>Lone Wolf McQuade (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The archetypical renegade Texas Ranger wages war against a drug kingpin with automatic weapons, his wits and martial arts after a gun battle leaves his partner dead. All of this inevitably culminates a martial arts showdown between the drug lord and the ranger, and involving the woman they both love.</p>
<p>J.J. McQuade is a Texas Ranger who doesn't exactly follow the rules, is unruly, and prefers to work alone, which earns the nickname, Lone Wolf McQuade. When he discovers some criminals have automatic weapons, he discovers that they were stolen from the military. He tries to handle on his own, as usual, but in the end, an old friend, and a prisoner, whom he was keeping under wraps, are killed. He is then relieved of duty. But then an FBI agent, who also wants to get these guys, offers to help McQuade, and along with a rookie, they track down the mastermind.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is perhaps the best of all the Chuck Norris movies and is a great precursor for his long running role as WALKER TEXAS RANGER.J.J.McQuade is also a Texas Ranger but somewhat more unkempt and ruthless than his TV counterpart,he is engaged in a running battle against a villainous arms dealer portrayed by David Carradine who faces Norris at the climax in a down and dirty mano a mano kick-fest which by this time the audience is screaming for.This is just the icing on the cake of a pleasing action packed movie directed with great gusto by Steve  Carver. The movie also has a superb cod spaghetti western score from Francesco Da Masi,veteran of dozens of Hercules type movies from the 60s;people enjoy this who normally would avoid a Chuck Norris movie,for those who like them anyway this is the best of the bunch.</p>
