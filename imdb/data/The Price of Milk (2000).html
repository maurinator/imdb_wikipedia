<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this movie very much. In fact, my wife and I enjoyed it so much, I have given it a 10 out of 10 rating. It is pretty important to watch this movie and think about symbolism and metaphor, so be aware that this movie might be confusing to you if you take it all very literally.The actors & actresses were extremely convincing, the cinematography was quite skillful, and the setting was idyllic. I almost wish I could visit the shooting location. The scenario was true-to-life in a very abstract way, punctuating some of the most topsy-turvy and emotional aspects of a relationship. In a way, they are outlining a stereotypical relationship, paying special attention to the subtler aspects of a marriage.If you have never had a long-term relationship, some aspects of this movie might not make a heck of a lot of sense to you.In the end, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to figure out metaphors and symbolism. There are no explosions. :D</p>
