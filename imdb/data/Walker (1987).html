<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alex Cox has created a visionary work.  This film is a masterpiece.  It's a one and a half hour joke with an incredible punchline that indelibly changed how I view the world.  Ed Harris is a dead ringer for the "grey eyed man of destiny".  I couldn't see anyone else in this role.  He's a perfect fit. This is an incredibly original work of historical fiction that tells a truly timeless story (pardon the pun) in a way that one could never forget.By all means, find this movie!</p>
