<h1>Psycho II (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Now declared legally sane, Norman Bates is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement over the protests of Marion Crane's sister Lila Loomis, who insists that he's still a killer and that the court's indifference to his victims by releasing him is a gross miscarriage of justice. Norman returns to his motel and the old Victorian mansion where his troubles started, and history predictably begins to repeat itself.</p>
<p>After twenty-two years of psychiatric care, Norman Bates attempts to return to a life of solitude, but the specters of his crimes - and his mother - continue to haunt him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Back in the 60's the genre wasn't popular or hadn't a definitive film to represent it. PSYCHO came and gave a name to the genre. Now picture Norman, his mother, and the elements that PSYCHO had mixed in the 80's craziness. It worked.  This has to be one of the best sequels to a horror masterpiece.PSYCHO is probably the most important horror film of all time and doing a sequel to it deserves a honorable mention. This sequel is by no means better or even close to the original Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece, no. But the result is a great and important horror film influenced by the slasher genre of the early 80's.  PSYCHO II has everything to succeed: good acting (Anthony Perkins is great!, Meg Tilly delivers and does it right), mystery, gore, a terrific script by Tom Holland (the master behind Fright Night and Child's Play), and a shocking ending.  Watch this movie if you think sequels are always a disaster when trying to match the original. This film delivers expectations and I'm proud to say that it's one of the best horror movies from the 80's, the decade when horror was at it's peek.Now in color Norman Bates manages to convince everyone that he is normal and ready for a normal life which is highly doubted by police and townspeople that still remember the events in 1960 when Bates started a murder spree. Norman returns to the Bates Motel and gets a job as a waiter. In the place where he works he falls in love with Meg Tilly's character and soon the murders begin to start once again.Norman's mother is back as well (?) and this time it won't be easy to blame Norman for the murders.  Who's behind Norman's actions? How far will he get? 8/10. Excellent sequel.</p>
