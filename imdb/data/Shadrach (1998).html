<h1>Shadrach (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1935, 99-year-old former slave Shadrach asks to be buried on the soil where he was born to slavery, and that land is owned by the large Dabney family, consisting of Vernon, Trixie and their seven children, and to bury a black man on that land is a violation of strict Virginia law.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was a bit surprised with the quality of this movie. I was only going to watch it due to Andie MacDowell being on it, but even the kid actors did a fine job. Certainly a drama movie worth watching. If you like drama movies, go rent this one, if only to see Andie in a different kind of role than usually. Nothing romantic about her character ;)</p>
