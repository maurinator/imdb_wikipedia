<h1>Going Places (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two whimsical, aimless thugs harass and assault women, steal, murder, and alternately charm, fight, or sprint their way out of trouble. They take whatever the bourgeois characters value: whether it's cars, peace of mind, or daughters. Marie-Ange, a jaded, passive hairdresser, joins them as lover, cook, and mother confessor. She's on her own search for seemingly unattainable sexual pleasure.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people.If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here.And also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc. like those of pulp fiction etc. Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate.When I looked at these two `hooligans' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant, I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been.The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour.SO, les valseuses is much better a name than going places. To dance a valse you need to be elegant, but going places you don't.</p>
