<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Inspector Clouseau disappears, and the Surete wants the world's second best detective to look for him. However, Clouseau's enemy, Dreyfus, rigs the Surete's computer to select, instead, the world's WORST detective, NYPD Sgt. Clifton Sleigh. Sleigh obtusely bungles his way past assassins and corrupt officials as though he were Clouseau's American cousin.</p>
<p>When famed French detective Clouseau goes missing while searching for the Pink Panther diamond, his bosses at the Surete decide they need a detective like him to find him. So they use a computer to select that person. They decide to let Chief Inspector Dreyfuss program the computer. But Dreyfuss, fearing the Clouseau return, decides to rig the computer to select the opposite. And after doing that, the computer chooses Clifton Sleigh from New York. And it turns out he is just as inept as Clouseau. When Dreyfuss meets him, he can't help but wonder if the two men are related. And just like Clouseau, he wants him dead. Sleigh sets out to find Clouseau but there are those who would like him not to find Clouseau so they try to take him out but like Clouseau manages to avoid getting harmed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Considering that "Curse of the Pink Panther" is a relatively recent film, it looks surprisingly dated. No wonder, since it's filled with stale jokes and visual gags that have already been executed in previous "Pink Panther" entries. Harmless and good-natured but completely unimaginative and mostly unfunny, this comedy may help you kill two hours, but it may also irritate you because of its exploiting the images of many of the series' stars just to gain some "dignity" as a film. Moore's cameo appearance at the end is indeed funny, but personally I've always known than Moore has a great comic flair.</p>
