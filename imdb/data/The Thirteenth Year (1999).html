<h1>The Thirteenth Year (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Cody Griffin turns 13, things are going good. He is a star swimmer, he is getting interest from a girl named Sam, and he has a supportive family. Then he discovers that he may be turning into a fish. He also discovers who his true friends are.</p>
<p>A teen learns that his birth mother is a mermaid after he begins to grow fins and slimy scales on his thirteenth birthday.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>it's about the little mermaid but as a boy. This is a family show with Dave Coulier from Full House and a beautiful mermaid looking for her son after 13 years. The adopted mother is behind the times and sorta fishy in the brains. This is a movie for those who don't mind being offended about gils and water. This movie is a fair movie but worth watching. I give it a 7/10 stars.</p>
