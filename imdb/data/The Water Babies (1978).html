<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember the first time I saw this movie I fell in love.  My parents taped it for me so that I could watch it over and over again. I actually still have a copy of it on an old BETA tape.  Unfortunately, I watched it so much that I ended up pretty much wearing the tape out.  Okay, so compared to the animation and acting of today, it can't compare but it was made in '78, what do you expect?  Animation and film have come a long way since then it's not going to be like the films of today. All I have to say is that it's a good family movie that I will always enjoy.  If you like classic movies, I would recommend this one.</p>
