<h1>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lying dormant at the bottom of Camp Crystal Lake, Jason Voorhees is released from his watery grave by a telekinetic girl. And so the killing begins again. Can she use her powers to stop Jason, or is he back for good?</p>
<p>A distraught little Tina Shepard dreams of the time when she believes she drowned her father with her anger-triggered psychic powers. A trip back to the site is supposed to help Tina, but her doctor merely wants to exploit her. In a rage, Tina accidentally frees Jason Voorhees from the bottom of the lake with her powers, and he begins to slaughter the teens next door. Tina becomes able to control her telekinesis in her fear-state and gives a strong showing against Jason.</p>
<p>Tina Shepard is a special girl. She has the gift of telekinesis (which allows her to manipulate objects by thought). But her gift is also a curse, mainly because she caused the death of her father on the docks of Camp Crystal Lake. Now, Tina has returned home with her caring mother and her conniving doctor, who wants to exploit Tina's powers and become famous. But the teenage residents of Camp Crystal Lake have something more to fear than Tina's powers as she accidentally frees Jason Voorhees from his watery grave. And Jason is really in the mood for a good old teenage massacre.</p>
<p>Years after Tommy Jarvis chained him underwater at Camp Crystal Lake, the dormant Jason Voorhees returns to the camp grounds when he is accidentally released from his prison by a telekinetic teenager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Weepy Tina Shepard arrives at Crystal Lake with her mom and her doctor. Tina is a wreck of a girl - plagued by a powerful telekinetic ability, Tina killed her drunken and abusive father in a fit of rage many years ago and has been trying to deal with her guilt ever since. Unfortunately, her sadistic doctor wants only to exploit Tina's powers and drives Tina to the breaking point with his cruelty. In yet another emotional fit, Tina attempts to raise her dead father from the depths of Crystal Lake, but instead raises the rotting carcass of Jason Voorhees instead, who emerges with his hockey mask intact and his bloodlust stronger than ever. Jason immediately heads into the woods and starts killing, gradually working his way to the house next door to Tina's, filled with vacuous partying teens. Tina, who is also precognitive, tries to warn those around her of impending death, but no one will believe the stressed out girl. Finally, Tina must battle Jason herself is she hopes to save her new boyfriend and herself from death.This is Kane Hodder's first outing as Jason Voorhees and its a really great one. Jason is a hulking killing machine of pure, cold rage and the deaths the accrue have never been more vicious or grimly satisfying. The now-famous sleeping bag bludgeon makes its first appearance in this 6th installment, and its one of my favorites - really nasty and brutally hilarious. Lar Park Lincoln is great as Tina perhaps a bit too weepy, but almost as angry as Jason and erupting ingreat displays of rage, both verbal and telekinetic. Lincoln did a lot of her own stunts in this one too, which is always impressive. The make-up effects in this movie are my absolute favorite. Jason is a wet, rotting cadaver, his spinal cord clearly visible through the shredded remains of his clothes, his ribcage poking out, his flesh dark with rot. The unmasking scene is a truly shocking and "wow!" inspiring awesome moment, as Jason's face is revealed to be little more than an animated skull - but animated it truly is! Beneath the hideous make-up, Hodder impressively expresses the evil wrath of Jason with one empty eye socket and half a mouthful of teeth. The telekinetic effects are a lot of fun as Tina "throws" every weapon at her disposal at Jason: a couch, a jar full of nails, a light fixture and finally a can of gasoline and the flames from the basement furnace. It was great to see someone give Jason a run for his money instead of just screaming and running away. All in all, one of the better sequels to follow the original Friday the 13th. 7 out of 10.</p>
