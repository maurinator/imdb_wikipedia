The head of a skid-row mission, "Doc' Thorssen (Ludwig Donath') and his blind daughter, Christine (Viveca Lindfors), take care of him and give him a job as a janitor.</p>
<p>A minister embittered by his wife's suicide turns away from God. He ends up among the bums of skid row before he finds meaning again through the love of a missionary's blind daughter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Hollywood film industry has often been accused of ignoring the issue of religious faith.  This is probably not because (as some people no doubt think) that the film industry is filled full of Godless Satanists.  Rather, it is because filmmakers simply do not wish to offend.Here is a rare film that has a clergyman as a protagonist.  Sterling Hayden portrays the Pastor who has a very deep crisis of faith after his alcoholic wife commits suicide.  He finds his way to and around skid row.  His Journey is a path to a redemption that he has not actually been seeking.Thomas Mitchell is great in this as well.  Actually, he's doing his Doc Boone act from STAGECOACH all over again.</p>
