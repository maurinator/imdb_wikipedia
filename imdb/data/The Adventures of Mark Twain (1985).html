<h1>The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on elements from the stories of Mark Twain, this feature-length Claymation fantasy follows the adventures of Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher and Huck Finn as they stowaway aboard the interplanetary balloon of Mark Twain. Twain, disgusted with the human race, is intent upon finding Halley's Comet and crashing into it, achieving his "destiny." It's up to Tom, Becky, and Huck to convince him that his judgment is wrong and that he still has much to offer humanity that might make a difference. Their efforts aren't just charitable; if they fail, they will share Twain's fate. Along the way, they use a magical time portal to get a detailed overview of the Twain philosophy, observing the "historical" events that inspired his works.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher and Huck Finn join Mark Twain on his airship to meet Halley's Comet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Adventures of Mark Twain" is a fascinating animated feature.  The clever mind of Will Vinton fashioned a masterpiece from the works of one of America's greatest writers.  Seeing stories like "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" and "The Diaries of Adam and Eve" fleshed out in animation is something else.  Of course, it's doubtful that any studio today would make an animated film exactly like this.  Still, I'd think it's a wonderful way to introduce younger people to classic American literature.</p>
