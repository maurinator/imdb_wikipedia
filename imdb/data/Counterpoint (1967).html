<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's now March 15,2006 and I'm adding this remark to my review because of some emails I got asking me to make it known if I find a way to obtain a copy of this film. I have found someone selling this film. I haven't bought one yet, but I plan to. I notice that he says the copy is fair to good. So don't expect wide screen and surrond. But the prices seem resonable, and he even has another one I'm looking for; W.W. and the DIxie Dance Kings. Here is the web address: www.ioffer.com/shops/cinema70. Take your time and make sure you know what your getting. Good Luck This is my second comment on this film. My first comments were brief and some time ago. Since them I notice some quite derisive comments have been left and I wanted to leave a current opinion. The most common negative statement is absurd. Certainly, the story line is fictional, and not that likely to happen. But come on! The fact of the matter is. A symphony orchestra is caught behind the lines of a German advance. And the egos of the two main characters ( the conductor and the German commander) stage their own personal battle. The German commander want a personal performance, the conductor knows they will be killed if he complies. He stalls trying to buy time, and thus save as many lives as possible. This was well acted, and I feel well written. I found myself caring what happened to these people. I wish it was available on DVD.</p>
