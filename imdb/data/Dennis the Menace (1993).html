<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For me, this cinema version featuring the innocent mischief of cartoonist Hank Ketcham's precocious hyperactive preschooler, Dennis (The Menace) Mitchell, is a classic sleeper. Remarkable performances by Mason Gamble (as "Dennis Mitchell") and Walter Matthau (as "Mr. Wilson") help to mold the screenplay into a delightful light-hearted comedy intended for the whole family. I, personally, look forward to the day that its presentation is offered in DVD format.</p>
