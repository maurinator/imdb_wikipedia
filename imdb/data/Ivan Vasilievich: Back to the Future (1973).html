<h1>Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shurik Timofeev builds a working model of a time machine. By accident, Ivan Bunsha, an apartment complex manager, and George Miloslavsky, a petty burglar, are transferred to the 16th century Moscow, while Tsar Ivan the Terrible goes into the year 1973.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is perhaps the best Soviet comedy ever made... But it`s very difficult for a person, who does not speak Russian to understand it completely. The movie is full with tricky details, specific language and many funny episodes, so typical for the Socialist era. It is a constant pleasure to watch over and over again!</p>
