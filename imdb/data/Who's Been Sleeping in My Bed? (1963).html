<h1>Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed? (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Actor Jason Steele plays a caring, godlike doctor on television. Off the set, he's the insecure fiancee of Melissa, a pretty art teacher. Jason doesn't know what to expect of marriage, especially after seeing how the fires have burned out in all of poker buddies' marriages. Complicating matters is that his friends' wives have confused Jason with his television persona and they keep popping up at his house ready to see what his bedside manner is like.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dean Martin is a TV star, who plays a doctor who gives out sage advice along with his caring bedside manner. His fans adore him and look up to him. And, his friends' wives reach out to him for help and a few kind words, because their husbands don't pay them enough attention. All the men play poker on Wednesday nights. But Dean can't play because the ladies are calling him and bugging him. What a guy! Meanwhile, he's engaged to Elizabeth Montgomery, but they bicker back and forth about a big wedding or an elopement. Then he's not ready at all. What begins as a promising time with Dino turns out to be a not-so-funny time that lasts way too long. It does have its moments and a few laughs here and there, with Carol Burnett, in her screen debut, supplying some energy. And, Ms. Montgomery is always a joy to watch. But overall, it's a disappointment. This was made by director Daniel Mann and writer Jack Rose, who the year earlier made Who's Got the Action with Dino and Lana Turner. The movies are similar in style, but Action is a lot funnier. For a pleasant time with Dino, I'd recommend something else first. But after all, Dino's great company no matter how you slice it.</p>
