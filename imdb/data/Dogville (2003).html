<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I went into the movie theater to see this film I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. All I knew was that "Dogville" had Nicole Kidman in it- an actress I have always liked- and Lars von Trier, a director I have always respected. I was quickly surprised by what the film was. Set entirely on a stage/sound stage I couldn't believe my eyes. As a theatre actor it was exciting to see how this all was going to work out. Dogville did not disappoint. Lars von Trier clearly creates a town that may seen ordinary and odd into masterful. Nicole Kidman was excellent and the supporting cast was flawless. It was great to see Lauren Bacall and I enjoyed her performance. When I first saw Paul Beattany in the film all I could think of was the awful film "A Knight's Tale" that he is also in. However he proved me wrong in his well developed character. Patricia Clarkson was great in her role as Vera, she is a stunning actress. If she keeps getting these great roles an Oscar is sure to be in her future. The film on the whole is wonderful. My only complaint was the length. Around the 2 hour mark I was getting kind of antsy, but the film brought me back to finish the roller coaster ride that the film gave. Truly an original. Go see it.</p>
