<h1>Nate and Hayes (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A swashbuckling adventure which takes place in the mid-1800's on the South Pacific islands where bloody raids and battles were once the rule of the day.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Nate and Hayes" brings to mind the great adventure epics and Saturday morning serials of the fifties.The plot is filled with cliffhangers and the characters are robust.  Tommy Lee Jones is compelling as the swashbuckling Booty Hayes, and the elegant Jenny Seagrove is the kind of "damsel in distress" that we'd all love to rescue from the likes of dispicable Capt. Pease.Spectacular locations in New Zealand and Fiji provide a perfect backdrop for the action, which will keep any adventure lover on the edge of his or her seat.Grab a giant tub of buttered popcorn and escape to the South Seas.  It's an exciting voyage!</p>
