<h1>How Do I Love Thee? (1970)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>rather strange but not without its merits. A comedy about religion and with Maureen O'Hara and Shelley Winters in the same film... but sadly no scenes together.. Jackie Gleason is the leading man and a odd choice of a husband for the beauteous Miss O'Hara. Rosemary Forsyth is the third lady in the cast, and a gorgeous lady in her own rite... Hard to really describe this movie cause it is rather unusual about a woman who fears for the mortal soul of her husband...It is worth a look if you can find it. NOt out on DVD and flopped at the box office upon release but as I am a big fan of Miss O'Hara I would see her read a phone book. It is one of her last feature films. I read somewhere that Gleason wanted Ava Gardner and Lana Turner for the two female lead roles; That would have been interesting too.. Check it out if you can find it.</p>
