<h1>Nine Hours to Rama (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"Nine hours to Rama" depicts the life of Nathuram Godse the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. How Godse planned the assassination is shown in the film. How he became a Hindu activist who (unfairly) blamed Gandhi for the killings of thousands of Hindus by Muslims is revealed in a series of flashbacks.</p>
<p>Fictional narrative of Hindu militant activist Nathuram Godse's plan to kill Mahatma Gandhi and of police officer Gopal Das' task to find the killer before it's too late.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film which builds up to a climax is spoilt by some unconvincing performances, especially Harry Andrews' Indian Officer and Robert Morley. Despite this, the direction is reasonable and the film worth seeing as there seem so few films about this subject.</p>
