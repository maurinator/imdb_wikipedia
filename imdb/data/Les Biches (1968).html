<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many films uses the "Menage a Trois" element to cause disturbances in the relationship between three people.  "Les Biches" uses this device to completely destroy its three characters.  A perfect psychological film, "Les Biches" is the ONLY film that I know where it doesn't use Menage a Trois as a facade, but allows the film to explore its themes of Jealousy and Obsession to a sensual and extremely disturbing effect.  Not even Truffaut's "Jules and Jim" used the device to this extent.  This film is suited for people who loves to watch movies that will make us think, rather than movies that tells us what to think.  Truly a hypnotic character study on physical and spiritual obsession.  Kudos to Chabrol, his lovely wife Stephane Aubran, cinematographer Jean Rabier, and the sensuous Jacqueline Sassard for their specific roles in creating a chilling masterpiece.</p>
