<h1>That's Carry On! (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>That's Carry on is a 'best of the carry on's' movie with Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor introducing clips from all the Carry On movies (from Carry on Sergeant to Carry on Behind). The two regulars converse at the Rank Film building to host the film, with their own running gags involving Barbara's "assets" and Kenneth's desperate need of a toilet!!!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, hardly the best of.If I were wanting to introduce someone to Carry On, I wouldn't recommend this. It wasn't full or complete.For some reason it showed more of Carry On Camping and the Khyber one. I thought I was watching the actual movie of one of them, so much scene was being shown.But there were great moments from other movies that weren't shown, which was a shame. Williams and Windsor did dish out their dialogue in the connecting bits very well. I especially liked Williams talking about how he would only listen to or work with someone who was clearly more intelligent than he, he worded it much better than that, and the clip from "Carry On Regardless" when he was walking the monkey was shown. Altho I now stand at having only seen half the series, the first half, that is, I do think there was more to the Carry On movies than what this hilight reel states.But I was disappointed that the theme music from the first five Carry Ons was dismissed with Cruising. What a pity. No idea how that music would have sounded with "Carry On Cowboy" or "Carry on Screaming" but I think someone who was half creative could have figured something out.Carry on.</p>
