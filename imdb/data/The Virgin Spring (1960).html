<h1>The Virgin Spring (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in beautiful 14th century Sweden, it is the sombre, powerful fable of wealthy land-owning parents whose daughter, a young virgin, is brutally raped and murdered by goat herders after her half sister has invoked a pagan curse. By a bizarre twist of fate, the murderers ask for food and shelter from the dead girl's parents, who, discovering the truth about their erstwhile lodgers, exact a chilling revenge.</p>
<p>In medieval Sweden, the innocent and beautiful but very pampered Karin, virgin daughter of a Christian landowner, is sent to church to deliver prayer candles, accompanied by the family's jealous pregnant servant girl, Ingeri, who still believes in the Norse gods. Upon entering the dark woods along the way, Karin leaves Ingeri behind and both have an encounter with strangers, but only one returns to Karin's family farm.</p>
<p>In Sweden during the Middle Ages, married couple Töre and Märeta are prosperous and devout farmers. They dote on their only surviving offspring, their daughter, the innocent Karin. Their attentiveness to her is despite her faults, such as her vanity and penchant for sleep when she should be doing farm work. It's early spring, and she is tasked with bringing candles to church for matins. She convinces her mother to let her wear her Sunday best if only in her want to look pretty. The church is in the nearest village which is still a good distance away, even by horseback. As such, she convinces her parents to allow Ingeri, their pregnant maidservant, to accompany her. Ingeri is secretly envious of Karin if only because of her own lost innocence. Ingeri prays to the Norse God Odin, her latest thoughts to Odin which are against Karin. Out of circumstance, Karin and Ingeri part company half way through their trek. Ingeri encounters a one eyed man, who she ultimately steers away from despite he being what she wanted. Karin encounters a group of goatherds, three brothers consisting of two adults and an adolescent. The two adult brothers eventually rape and murder Karin, while their younger brother watches. What they are unaware of is that Ingeri, horrified, witnessed both the rape and murder, she who contemplated attacking the brothers during the rape but which she ultimately did not do. On their travels, the three brothers decide to take refuge at a farm, Töre and Märeta's farm, the couple who welcome the three into their manor house out of Christian charity. The questions become whether either side will discover their connection, and what Ingeri will do based on her prayers and what she witnessed. Through Karin's absence, Töre and Märeta critically review their family dynamic.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sometimes Bergman's films, though full-fledged masterpieces (I AM NOT DISCREDITING HIM), are visual expressions seen with the screen as a wall between the viewer and the characters. I think that wall was taken down with "The Virgin Spring". Here he tells an emotionally intense story at the perfect pace with perfect pitch. No matter how horrific the occurrences on the screen, this film has been created with such an aesthetically appealing touch that the dichotomies and balance Bergman works towards is evident. Terrific!</p>
