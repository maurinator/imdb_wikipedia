<h1>Trapeze (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mike Ribble was once a great trapeze artist - and the only to have completed a triple somersault - before his accident. Tino joins the circus, and manages to covince Mike to teach him the 'triple'. Meanwhile Lola, a tumbler, wants to get in on the act.</p>
<p>Tino Orsini has learned the trapeze from his father but he travels to Europe to seek out Mike Ribble, one of the few men who has managed to complete a triple somersault. Ribble no longer works the trapeze and now walks with a cane after a nasty fall left him a cripple. Orsini convinces him to act as his catcher and all is well until the gold digging Lola, who'll do just about anything to become part of a major circus act, arrives on the scene. Her presence creates friction between the two men and puts in doubt whether Tino will ever accomplish the elusive triple.</p>
<p>Mike Ribble was the sixth trapeze artist ever to complete an almost impossible triple somersault. Naturally gifted Tino Orsini wants to be the seventh, if he can only persuade a retired Ribble to teach him how and to be his catcher. Ribble retired from the high flying following his trapeze accident, which not only broke his body - he now walks with a limp and a cane - but more importantly his spirit. Orsini's enthusiasm eventually brings Ribble's spirit back to life. "Ribble & Orsini" become the talk of the circus as they work on the triple somersault. However, Lola, an acrobat in the same circus, will do whatever she needs to do to make sure the circus spotlight is solely on her.</p>
<p>A crippled circus acrobat is torn emotionally between two ambitious young trapeze artists, one a talented young American and a less-gifted but beautiful Italian.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There were not many films made about the circus, but this one tops them all by far. Much better than DeMille's melodramatic soap opera which won an Oscar for Demille by default.Getting back to Trapeze, this film combines a wonderful story with beautiful acting from the stars and supporting cast, and the photography of the aerial stunts will leave you felling as though you attended the circus in person. Lancaster who at one time actually performed in a circus act, gives a towering performance and Curtis and Lollabridgida are terrific as well. This is easily the gorgeous Gina'a best dramatic role, and we see that she was a very much underrated performer in her time.Thomas Gomez and Katy Jurado are wonderful in support as are all the lesser players. This is a look at the real circus from inside. It's about the longings about real stars and the ways they attempt to achieve and hold on to that elusive stardom.This film does not contain a dull moment and has a fantastic climax that will keep you glued, and on the edge of your seat as if you were sitting ringside.It is somewhat a shame that this great film is not well known at this time and of course would never be mentioned on any top 100 or even 1,000 list, but long after Casablanca and Citizen Cane have been relegated to their rightful places in history, this film and many others will be truly recognized for the masterpieces that they are.</p>
