<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie once in a little movie theater in Minneapolis in 1964 when I was ten years old, and to this day it haunts me!The sense of imminent doom, the "Lord of the Flies"-esque cruelties that erupt amongst the schoolchildren, the steadily-building panic... I will never ever look at an abandoned refrigerator -- or see a plane start to cross the sky -- and not think of the heart-breaking climax of this movie!</p>
