<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Every holiday Marcel and his family go to their cottage in the Provence (France). He likes the hills in this region. Before they arrive at the cottage they have to walk about 5 miles. With the co-operation of an ex-pupil of Marcel's father, who's a teacher, they only have to walk 1 mile, since they can take a shortcut along a canal, through the backyards of some eccentric people. During one of these holidays he meets Isabelle, a pretty but conceited girl...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'd recommend this film very strongly to movie lovers.Oh, you'll have to read the subtitles. It's French... don't be afraid... this film makes complete sense to any audience and is not art for art's sake.But hey, you wouldn't be reading these comments if you weren't intelligent and discerning, so subtitles wouldn't be a problem, I know.Really, give it a try. The other comments on this movie are absolutely correct. It is completely charming and will hold you in it's influence for the whole movie. Mostly the story of a the relationship between a small boy and a girl he meets. Well-observed, hilariously funny in parts. Exquisite acting of the first order. You'll never forget it. Give it a try.</p>
