<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This predictable and formulaic Western will not blow you away with its brilliance, but it IS fun, carried along almost entirely by the strong presences of its top stars. Only Jim Kelly and his karate moves feel out of place. And it also must be mentioned that the big moment that you all (?) have been waiting for, a fight between Jim Brown and Fred Williamson, does arrive in this film....but the scene is terribly unrealistic-looking. (**1/2)</p>
