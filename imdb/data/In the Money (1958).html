<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After a successful run of 58 movies from 1946 to 1958, the Bowery Boys series came to an end with this movie.  It probably died from a combination of the inroads television was making, the fact that the boys were getting too old to play adolescents, and the loss of Leo Gorcey for the last 7 movies. (He said he couldn't continue after his father, Bernard Gorcey, died in 1955.) His malapropisms, leadership and confidence was sorely missed by me.  Stanley Clements takes his place in this movie, and I counted just one malapropism. Huntz Hall is up to his usual childish tricks (which made him so endearing to his fans, including me), dog-sitting a poodle on an ocean voyage to London for some diamond smugglers.  But the other members of the gang, who were stowaways on board, seemed like excess baggage, and Hall just couldn't carry the comedy by himself.  The movie didn't have the energy of the early entries, which Leo Gorcey and even Bernard Gorcey provided.  A sad ending to a series I enjoyed as a kid.</p>
