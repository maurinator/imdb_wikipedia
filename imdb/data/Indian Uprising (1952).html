<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's 1885 in Arizona and an Army Captain has dispersed his troops to keep the whites off of Government land thereby keeping the peace with the Apaches. But there are those in Tucson that want the miners back looking for gold and they put pressure on officials in Washington. Soon a new commander arrives, the troops are recalled, and the miners go after gold. Whites then kill a miner with an arrow so they can attack the Indians hoping the troops wipe them out when they retaliate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In a film that's a cut rate version of the story told in the John Ford classic Fort Apache, George Montgomery stars as the Indian wise and fair army captain on the Arizona frontier. Montgomery is in charge of a post that is dedicated to keeping the whites out of sacred Apache homeland.Easier said than done as there's gold in those Apache hills and some unscrupulous whites want it. Adding to that there's a glory hunting army major who's looking to advance his career by stopping Geronimo played by Robert Shayne.The only cast link to Fort Apache is that of Miguel Inclan who was a stoic and impassive Cochise in the Ford film and in Indian Uprising Inclan plays a more animated Geronimo.Though not quite as good as Fort Apache, Devil's Doorway or Broken Arrow Indian Uprising is a solid western film with good action sequences. And in that the Indians are three dimensional characters it's a valuable teaching tool as well.</p>
