<p>The movie begins with the end of Paranormal Activity 2 (2010). Katie is possessed by a demon, kills her sister Kristi, and runs away with Kristi's son Hunter.

<p>It has been five years since the disappearance of Katie and Hunter, and a suburban family witness strange events in their neighborhood when a woman and a mysterious child move in.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Franchise fatigue has definitely set in with this tedious fourth instalment. After taking things off on a slightly different tangent with the previous film, the same writing/directing duo instead plump for the same old, same old - lots of nothing happening before LOUD NOISES! freak out the teenage girls in the audience and the less discerning horror moviegoers. And, despite some spirited (ha!) performances, the lack of any real plot development leaves the mythology treading water and the series as a whole rather confused.Ultimately, PA 4 is a step back and the textbook definition of 'diminished return'.</p>
