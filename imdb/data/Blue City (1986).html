<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Judd Nelson does some butt kicking in this film. This was released during the Brat Pack days following Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire. The 3rd film in a row that paired Judd with Ally Sheedy. The subject matter is serious but Judd brings much needed comedy to his role, kind of an everyman Rambo character. An entertaining film to watch especially if you like Judd.</p>
