<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Marseilles, a woman commits suicide after she is raped in an alley. Nightly, her brother Gerard broods at the scene hoping to catch the rapist. He lives with his lover Bella whom he neglects, an alcoholic brother who lurks about, and his father who's stayed drunk since the daughter's death, ignoring work and his own companion. At a seedy bar, Gerard meets a wealthy, nihilistic hedonist and his beautiful sister. Gerard flips for her and thinks she's his ticket out of the slum. Bella warns him otherwise and also, in jealousy, sets two thugs on him. Then Gerard thinks he's found his sister's rapist. These emotional crises force Gerard to choose what's most important.</p>
<p>He is a revenge-obssessed stevedore whose sister was brutally raped and murdered. She is a wealthy, elusive woman. They try hard to get together... or do they?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One plausible reason why French critics failed to appreciate the beauty of this film might have something to do with it being a "mood" based film. It must be stated with caution that films with a certain 'mood' take their own time to settle in the minds of viewers. This is one reason why some critics must have failed to interpret "Moon in the gutter" in the right spirit. Jean Jacques Beineix and his screen writing collaborator Olivier Mergault must be congratulated for their realistic depiction of the milieu from which this film's seedy characters come. They give an air of authenticity to an area where one can easily find all types of low lives who do not hesitate a bit to waste their time over petty fights. It is rather a sad feeling to read a lot of negative comments about French director Jean Jacques Beineix's film "Moon in the gutter". The reason for not liking this film could be many as there is no universal agreement about audiences and their tastes. However, it must be remembered that all filmmakers have the right to portray their visions on the big screen in the manner which suits them the best. From this yardstick, nobody has the right to censure Monsieur Beineix for his film which has also been hailed by many critics outside France as a masterpiece.</p>
