<h1>The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frederick Bolton has to solve two problems. First, his boss has instructed him to come up with a reasonable campaign to promote a new product, a stomach pill named "Aspercel" - by tomorrow. The second problem is Fred's daugther, Helen. She is absolutely fond of horses, takes riding classes and has already had decent success in some competitions. Her biggest wish is to own a horse herself, a dream her father cannot afford at all. Now Fred tries to solve both problems at once by simply combining them: A horse named "Aspercel", ridden by his daugther should bring the name of the pill into the papers and make Helen happy, too. But there's still one more obstacle: Helen and Aspercel of course have to win a few races to make this idea work...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>an all family movie from the 60's If you were ever a horse crazy youngster and want to see a film with a bunch of beautiful horses and a Benji looking dog. here it is... although you will have it all figured out in advance, it is an entertaining, fun flick. all are happy, all ends well for everyone in this film. there is no downside unless you die from the sugar in it all. You will see a real young Kurt Russell as Dean Jones' daughters' boyfriend too,then you can check how he looks nowadays in his more mature adult roles, like Stargate etc. If you want to show your kids or grandkids a time when the hard facts of life were set aside in favor of some light entertainment and that all movies don't have portray "real Life" this is one of them. Disney was so good at bringing out fairy tales and just nice movies. Another thing i always liked was seeing events that do not occur anywhere around where i lived. Eastern style riding, the clothes, the events held and even the horses are alien to what we see out here in the western u.s. I am used to rodeos and quarter horses, and have yet to see an actual steeplechase, or sulky race or folks togged out for fox hunting. Even the jumping events that are in this show are not commonly found here in the rocky Mountains. So watching it is kind of extra fun, because it is not common here.</p>
