<h1>The Kid Stays in the Picture (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This documentary captures the life story of legendary Hollywood producer and studio chief Robert Evans. The first actor to ever to run a film studio, Robert Evans' film career started in 1956, poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. His good looks, charm and overwhelming confidence captured the eye of screen legend Norma Shearer, who offered him a film role. After a glamorous--but short-lived--career as a movie star, Evans tried out producing. At the age of 34, with no producing credits to his name, he landed a job as chief of production at Paramount Pictures. Evans ran the studio from 1966-1974. During his tenure, he was responsible for such revolutionary films as The Godfather, Rosemary's Baby, Love Story, The Odd Couple, Harold and Maude and Chinatown. By the early '80s, the Golden Boy of Hollywood was losing his luster. After a failed marriage to Ali MacGraw, a cocaine bust and rumored involvement with the Cotton Club murder, he disappeared into near-obscurity. Only through tremendous will and uncanny luck did he once again rise as the kid who stays in the picture.</p>
<p>Movie mogul Robert Evans self narrates the story of his movie life. Once an aspiring actor, he was a successful business owner of a woman's wear company when, independently, Hollywood royals actress Norma Shearer and producer Darryl F. Zanuck plucked him out of nowhere to be featured in major supporting roles in two separate movies. His acting career was short as he realized that he was not very good at it, and that his passion lied elsewhere in the movie business. He wanted to be the next Darryl F. Zanuck. In large part due to an article written by entertainment columnist Peter Bart, Evans did become a producer and then ultimately head of Paramount Pictures, one of the then lower tier of the premier movie studios. Evans' place at the studio hinged on the success of a few key movies including Rosemary's Baby (1968), Love Story (1970) (working on which sparked the short but passionate personal relationship with future wife, actress Ali MacGraw), and The Godfather (1972). Under his tenure, Paramount became the number 1 studio in Hollywood. Those successes led to an unusual contract with Paramount, which in turn led to his return to producing such acclaimed movies as Chinatown (1974), and ultimately quitting his job at the studio. But Evans' life had some major falls, especially in the 1980's, with the start of his cocaine use, the failure of some highly touted and big budget films such as The Cotton Club (1984), and implication in the murder of aspiring producer Roy Radin, which in combination led to major bout of depression. He would need the assistance of his true friends to help him regain his life.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Somewhere in this grating, self-congratulatory exercise in ego-mania is a fascinating documentary about one of the most talented and successful players in the history of Hollywood. By sealing it all up in a stiffing first-person bubble, though, Robert Evans and the film makers turn what could have been a great journey into the equivalent of being stuck on an airplane with someone who can't shut up about himself. All biographies have a point of view. I've never seen one, though, that insists on giving the viewer ONLY one perspective to the point that the main character is the only one allowed to speak, quoting other people in irritating (and in some cases racist) caricatures while continuously employing false modesty, name dropping, and hackneyed "homespun" quips meant to sound like hard-earned wisdom. They should have printed 15 copies of this film and passed them around to friends and family of "The Kid" in the title. Considering the flood of quality documentaries that have been released in the last decade, the general Viewing public deserves something better.</p>
