<h1>All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sea-faring saga of two brothers (Robert Taylor, Stewart Granger) and the woman they both love. Set against South Pacific islands, this love triangle pits the good brother against the bad as they squabble over Ann Blyth and a bag of pearls on the floor of a lagoon; the bad boy redeems himself, however, by helping fend off a mutiny.</p>
<p>In the South Pacific islands, two brothers, one good and one bad, fight over the same girl and over a bag of pearls.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A good old fashioned swashbuckler.   Taylor's acting comes across as a bit wooden at times, but the scenes with his brother and the Polynesian girl are enticing.....reminiscent of Gauguin in Tahiti.  A good way to get lost for a few hours.</p>
