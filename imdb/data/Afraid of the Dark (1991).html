<h1>Afraid of the Dark (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lucas is a little boy who's going blind. The only thing that could save his eyesight is a risky eye operation that could either fix his eyes or blind him for good. Scared, lonely and half-blind, he lets his subconscious fears and desires and grim imagination run loose. He spends a lot of his time spying on people and visiting the local graveyard and the mausoleum. He starts seeing a creepy serial killer everywhere in town, who goes after blind women and stabs them in the eyes. Lucas doesn't tell anyone about this, not even his police officer father. He also starts seeing other people, who are not blind, as if they were blind. Lucas also develops an unhealthy interest in his much older stepsister, who is about to get married and leave their family home, and becomes jealous of her husband to be. Things culminate when he sees a dog he believes to be rabid, and when his pregnant mother finally gives birth to his baby sister. Can Lucas return from the brink of sanity and what, if anything, of the things he sees is real?</p>
<p>A young boy, facing impending surgery on his eyes to try to stave off blindness, wanders his quiet London neighborhood. The only problem is he believes that a slasher is stalking blind women.</p>
<p>A little boy, obsessed with blindness and violence, slowly gets trapped in his own delusions.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Persuaded that his blind mother is threatened by a murderer, a little boy leads an inquiry which leads him to the brink of madness.Variation on the psychological thriller, "Clairvoyance" tugs us, in the course of a tortuous intrigue, into a shady world, where reality and imagination get completely muddled. A puzzling and alarming work.</p>
