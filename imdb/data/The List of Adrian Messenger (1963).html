<h1>The List of Adrian Messenger (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Messenger asks a friend to check into a list of names before leaving on a trip. When his plane is blown out of the sky, the matter becomes more serious. As his friend checks into the list, each seems to have died in mysterious circumstances. As he goes down the list, the deaths become more recent and a race to find the remaining survivors and what put each of them on this list ensues.</p>
<p>While visiting the estate of the Marquis of Gleneyre, retired MI-5 officer Anthony Gethryn is asked by old friend Adrian Messenger to look into the backgrounds of the ten people on a list he has made. He's somewhat secretive about what it is he wants to learn but Gethryn agrees. When Messenger is killed while en route to Montreal - a bomb explodes and destroys the aircraft in mid-flight - Gethryn comes to believe that Adrian's list should have perhaps had an eleventh name on it - that of Adrian Messenger. Most of those people have died, usually in the form of some accident or another and he is now convinced that they were all murdered. Working with a survivor from the airplane disaster, Max Karoudjian - himself a former fighter in the French Resistance during the war - Gleneyre tries to determine who would want to have them all killed.</p>
<p>A former intelligence officer is tasked by the heir to the Gleneyre estate to investigate the unusual deaths of a disparate group of eleven men on a list.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wanted to say something in praise of the masked star gimmick - something I haven't seen anyone else mention.Rather than viewing the various "heavily made-up" characters as a spot the star contest, look at it from the other side and, suddenly, the gimmick becomes an ingenious way of covering up the killer - hiding him from the audience. Since the filmmakers knew they couldn't find a way to make a full head latex "invisible" to the audience, (and presumably didn't want to go with a completely other actor) they went the Purloined Letter route and threw in a bunch of such "spottable" characters to keep the audience from guessing which one was the killer.Much like the movie The Spanish Prisoner - where every person seems somehow fakey UNTIL you watch from the viewpoint of "spot the scam" and realize the EVERYONE sounds fake (i.e., like they're scamming someone) so you CAN'T spot the con artists.Brilliant, really. In both cases.</p>
