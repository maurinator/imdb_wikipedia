<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this comedy, Peter Ustinov is the famous pirate's ghost that returns to our time. Blackbeard has been cursed by his last wife who was a notorious witch, so that he will never die. The only way to "break" the curse is to do (for once in his life) a good act. Is the famous pirate able to do something good?</p>
<p>On the Carolina coast, Godolphin College's new track coach lodges at Blackbeard's Inn, run by the Daughters of the Buccaneers who claim to be descendants of the notorious pirate and who risk losing their hotel to the local mobster.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie had great memories from when I saw it as a kid.  Usually, the movie's never as good as it was, you know, when you see it again once you're older.  This one is still great, though!  The jokes and gags are, for the most part, routine and common, but I think Peter Ustinov made the movie. You just have to let go of everything and have fun with it.</p>
