<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>now, everyone has their own opinion on movies and the comment above is fair if that is what he thinks, but, to me, this movie is still a great piece of work by the legendary, sir Norman wisdom. i admit, not my fav out of 13 films of his i've seen but its still good firm piece of British comedy which i, being British, am proud of. so, if you have enjoyed other classic movies of his such as one good turn, just my luck, up in the world,girl on the boat, the bulldog breed, follow a star and many, many others,then i suggest you give this a go and judge for yourself. "mr.grimsdale!" classic. i can honestly say, hand on hart, that sir Norman wisdom is a true legend and will always be a favourite actor of mine for the rest of my life.</p>
