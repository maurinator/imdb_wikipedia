<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gut-wrenching thriller about corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who tries to become a very rich man by working at the same time for the New York Police Department and for the Mob as an informant. Things start to go downhill when he falls in love with a cruel and merciless assassin, Mona Demarkov, who's being targeted by the Mob. Romeo is Bleeding is the ultimate film-noir of the 20th century, everything about this film is so weird and evokes a sense of despair and hopeless that watching it Â‘till the last minute puts you gasping for more air. It's hard to put it into words, since Romeo is Bleeding is more like an experience itself, but a simplistic way to define the atmosphere the picture creates is describing it as a cross between the violence and style of a Batman movie (only without Batman) and your typical Humphrey Bogart flick, like The Maltese Falcon. Outstanding performances by Gary Oldman as Grimaldi and Lena Olin as Mona Demarkov. This character was a true present for Olin and she chews the scenery every moment she's on screen. The part was perfect for her, no one could pull this one of so perfectly, except perhaps for Jennifer Connelly, it would be interesting to see her in a role like that, since it seems that Jennifer herself jumped right of a 30's-40's noir movie (I was impressed by her in Dark City). Burt Reynolds or Tom Selleck would have suited perfectly into the role of Grimaldi, but Oldman was great. I also found very interesting that Jack Grimaldi wasn't a bad guy, Oldman constructed the character as a man who just wouldn't fit in the life that was given for him, and his thirst for more and more was responsible for sending his life into a spiral of  violence, decadence and death.</p>
