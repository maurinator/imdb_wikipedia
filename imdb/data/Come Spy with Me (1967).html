<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When CBS used to show late movies years and years ago, I remember staying up to watch this. There's only about two things I really recall: that Troy Donahue was in it, and that the theme song, performed by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles (!) was at least halfway decent. So the previous reviewer certainly can't be blamed for not remembering the song or the lyrics (which rhymed "spy with me" and "variety".) Like many of the Bond knockoffs of the day, the song was about the only thing the audience was even meant to remember, if that. I just recall that the single was a much bigger hit than the movie ever was. So if you happen to stumble across it on cable, it's more of a curiosity piece than a "must-see."</p>
