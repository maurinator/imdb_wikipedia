<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you're looking for any sort of award winning cinematic experience with deeply textured meaning this flick is not for you. However if you just want to relax with something that demands almost no thought but will give you more fun than it should this will be perfect.A teen comedy mixed with spy spoof this was supposed to be the launch pad for current teen dream Richard Grieco. It didn't lead to a big career for him but he is appealing in the lead. His extremely over-waxed eyebrows aside he is attractive and humorous as a college student mistaken for a secret agent on a summer class field trip in Europe. The script is silly and the situations ludicrous but there are two things that make this worth catching, the gadgets and the cast. Once the plot kicks in Grieco's character is outfitted with the sort of weapons, cars, etc that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond picture all utilized in a fun way. The real strength of the film though is a cast that is far above what would be usual in this type of flick. Aside from Grieco's game performance there's Robin Bartlett's ever more flustered French Teacher who by the end is kicking butt and taking prisoners. Plus the totally unhinged evil duo of Roger Rees and Oscar winner Linda Hunt chewing the scenery and having a hell of a good time thereby providing the audience with one too. The rest of the cast also plays into the proper mood of lampooning the spy genre making this a breezy delight. With Quebec standing in for Europe there are some beautiful locations and for any car lover some very cool vehicles. The definition of escapist fare.</p>
