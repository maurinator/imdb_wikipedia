<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love opera and of all opera, I love La Boheme best. I even named my boat after it and our two cats are named Mimi and Rodolfo (Rudi.) I have about ten videos of La Boheme. I may scrap them all after seeing this one. Zeferelli, Von Karajan and Freni on one tape. It is too much! Freni is the finest Mimi I've ever seen. I watched it alone on a snowy evening here in the northern woods of Ontario --- my wife hates opera ---  and when it ended I rose to my feet applauding wildly and shouting Brava! Brava!It is a superb production! And so what if my wife thinks I'm nuts!</p>
