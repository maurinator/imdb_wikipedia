<h1>Who's Minding the Store? (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Barbara is a very rich girl who falls in love with Norman Phiffier, a poor young man. She doesn't tell him who she really is and prepares to marry him. But, Mrs. Tuttle (Barbara's mother) doesn't want her daughter to mary such a poor man. So, she hires Norman at one of her big stores, and gives him the most difficult and disgusting works. She hopes that seeing Norman humiliated, Barbara will finally leave him. But things don't work exactly this way...</p>
<p>Norman Phiffier works as a store clerk in a large department store. Clumsy and inept, he can't do anything right. Boy are they in trouble!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Everyone talks about Jerry Lewis films such as "The Nutty Professor","The Geisha Boy",and others.But no one hardly talks about "Who's Minding The Store?"which IMHO,is his most underrated movie ever!Jerry is so funny in this film,you would have thought the Three Stooges should have been in it! The other reason I love this film:Francesca Bellini,who plays Shirley the pretty secretary who wears the very tight skirts.Agnes Moorehead & Ray Walston are great in their respective roles as well,but the climax of the movie will have you rolling with laughter!</p>
