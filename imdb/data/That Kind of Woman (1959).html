Kay is smitten with Red as they spend the day in New York, and Red invites her to meet him on the evening train to visit his family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's hard to watch a film set in 1944 when everyone (especially the women) have hair, make-up and clothing directly from 1959 when the film was made. Its drives me crazy because I find it hard to get a sense of the time when it looks completely different than it's supposed to be. Barbara Nichols is absolutely excellent in her role however and Tab Hunter is hot. Sophia is very good and quite comfortable in working in English by this, her fourth film to be made in the US. It's just too bad that no one cared to make films look historically accurate especially when hair, make-up and costume greats read a script that says the action takes place in a certain era yet choose to ignore such an important element. I think a lot of it also had to do with the star wanting to look perfect for that time without a care to the script.</p>
