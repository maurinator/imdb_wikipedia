<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had heard of this film, but never had the chance to see it.  Knowing that Max Baer wrote and starred in it really didn't mean much to me either way. Although I often identify actors with their TV roles, I've seen a lot of them who got famous by playing goofy characters in phenomenal roles, so I don't usually judge them by their other work.  And in this case, that's a good thing.  Stumbled onto the Anchor Bay release of this at Wal-Mart for $3, so I figured I'd check it out.  Not my usual style of movie, I prefer comedy, horror or camp, but I'm a movie buff and for the price, I figured what-the-hell.  And I wasn't disappointed.The acting is solid.  Usually in low budget films there's at least one actor who simply can't act, but not here.  Everyone in the film is believable enough to hold your attention and make you forget how unlikely the string of coincidences that happen near the end would be.  Baer, who in his first scene seems reminiscent of Jethro Clampett, soon shows that he does have acting abilities.  And the other three leads are exceptional.  Although it seems like it takes forever for something to happen (it's an hour into the 90 min film before the "shocking" part begins to unfold), the beginning is enjoyable.  You forget for a while that there's a point and get swept up in the antics of these (real-life) brothers who are joyriding when their car breaks down in Macon County.  Back in the good old days when character development was more important than special fx, a lot of time was spent on doing just that, developing the characters.  You start to care about the three leads, which makes it much more disturbing when Baer goes after them near the end for a crime they didn't commit.  And what's revealed at the end is a total mind blower that slaps you across the face and shoots you between the eyes.  Just for the twist ending, the film is well worth your time. Too bad the videos didn't sell well and are now in the bargain bins, but it's a bargain-bin-classic that I'd recommend to anyone.</p>
