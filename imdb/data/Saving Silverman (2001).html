<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>some people of course will dislike this movie for various reasons.  Saving silverman isnt going to win an oscar but its not the goal of the film to be a possible best picture candidate.  Its goal is to be hilarious and in my opinion it fulfilled that goal.  I actually didnt have very high expectations of the film going into it but I found it much more entertaining than i had thought.  Jack Black was especially hilarious.  If you have a good sense of humor you wont be disappointed by this film.</p>
