<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Story of Jesse Owens and his struggle against racism during and after the Olympics. Very well made and entertaining to watch. The story is well researched. The videos of the Olympics were especially good. The insight provided by the people around him is what makes the story. The director does a great job of presenting the story to us. I guess the editing. Also highlights the Nazi movement and how it was trying to use the Olympics as a stage to further their agenda. What is also surprising is how the US caved to the demands of the Nazis when it came to fielding their athletes. And what he faced in the US after he successfully represented the country isn't pretty either. A must watch to learn some good historical points.</p>
