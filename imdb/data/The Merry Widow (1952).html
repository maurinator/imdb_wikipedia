<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1952 MGM production of Franz Lehar's classic pales in comparison with the Erns Lubitsch's lavish version, that even in black and white, is richer and more appealing to the eye than the later account. Part of the blame must go to whoever decided to tailor make the film to suit its star, Lana Turner, and the direction of Curtis Bernhardt. As an operetta "The Merry Widow" has been delighting audiences for quite some time. The music alone is worth the price of admission, or in this case, the price of being able to get TCM on cable.The other interesting thing is how the Technicolor used in the filming of this remake has faded after more than fifty years. The copy shown by TCM recently had a faded look that made it less interesting to watch.Lana Turner and Fernando Lamas made an attractive couple, but their chemistry doesn't quite make it. Veterans Una Merkel, Thomas Gomez, Richard Haydn, and Marcel Dalio, among others, try their best, but their efforts don't make the film better. We would strongly advise discerning viewers to check out the older Lubitsch's take on this timeless work.</p>
