<h1>Under Suspicion (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1959 Brighton, disgraced cop turned private detective Tony Aaron works largely on falsifying adulteries for use as evidence in divorce cases. He involves his wife as the fictional co-respondent for painter Carlo Stasio but the pair are shot dead in the hotel room. In charge of the case is Frank, Tony's ex-partner still on the Brighton force. His most likely suspects are Angeline, Stasio's mistress who is set to inherit his house and pictures, and Tony himself, parts of whose story don't seem to add up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This neo-noir is definitely worthwhile. I could see no plot holes and I think it will stand up under repeated viewings. Liam Neeson does a superb job that few other actors could handle for this particular role and story. The plot and the characters in the story mesh quite well.There is a little bit of "time limit" suspense toward the end that doesn't feel altogether right, but extremely few movies are without defects. Otherwise, the entire effort is handled very capably. Production values are very good.I read no reviews before seeing the movie, other than a few words saying that it was a noir and underrated, both of which it is. That's the best way of seeing it, without knowing anything about it, and so I am saying the minimum. I view it as a suspenseful mystery-crime noir with procedural detective elements. It is not a thriller.If you get a chance, check it out.</p>
