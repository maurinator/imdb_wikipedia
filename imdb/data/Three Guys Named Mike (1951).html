<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was completely caught off guard by this charming and absolutely entertaining comedy. This film is just right for someone seeking good, clean escapist fun. The story of a small town girl (Jane Wyman, perfectly wonderful in the role)who becomes a flight attendant for American Airlines and is pursued by half the leading men in Hollywood (Van Johnson, Barry Sullivan, Howard Keel), will have you forgetting your troubles and getting happy in no time. Sidney Sheldon co-wrote the screenplay, which continued a successful career highlighted by an Academy Award a few years earlier for his Original Screenplay "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer". Although I think June Allyson was just made for the leading role, Wyman proves herself to be a talented comedienne. Breezy, fast paced and fun are key words to describe this delightful souffl√©. *** (out of 4)</p>
