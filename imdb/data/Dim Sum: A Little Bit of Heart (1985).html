<h1>Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In San Francisco, an immigrant Chinese widow welcomes the new year with some unhappiness: she's 62 now, she wants to make a trip to China to pay last respects to her ancestors, a fortune teller has told her this is the year she'll die, and a daughter, Geraldine, remains unmarried. Geraldine does have a boyfriend, but she's not sure she's ready for marriage, and, anyway, he lives in Los Angeles and Geraldine doesn't want to leave her mother alone in her declining years. Mrs. Tan's cheerful brother-in-law tries to help out. Is there any solution that will enable Mrs. Tan to hold onto her culturally-influenced and deep-seated hopes, yet keep those hopes from suffocating Geraldine?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The story of a mother who cannot be happy until her daughter is married and she feels her time to leave this Earth is near.The matter is not helped any when she walks in on her daughter having sex with her boyfriend. The mother never speaks English. This is best driven home during a mah jong game with other ladies. The mother speaks endlessly with one woman, the other woman in English, mother speaks only Chinese.I think there was accusations of cheating at the game, then all the English dissipated.Hands down, it was Uncle Tam who made this thing work and kept the situation from getting too serious.He just wanted to please. When a special dinner didn't turn out quite like he wanted, he simply put the lid on the pot and forgot about it.My brother would record this program off ETV years ago, but I suspect his copy is now solid blue. Shame to never get the chance to see this one again. It was a winner.</p>
