<h1>Mon oncle Antoine (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in cold rural Quebec at Christmas time, we follow the coming of age of a young boy and the life of his family which owns the town's general store and undertaking business.</p>
<p>It's the not too distant past in the working class Eastern Townships of Quebec. In the approach to Christmas, much of the focus of the town is on the general store, owned and operated by Antoine and Cecile, the former who also acts as the town's undertaker. The focus on the store is due to the Christmas shopping by the townsfolk and their want to see the nativity display in the store's window. Fernand, who works as a clerk in the store, has a secret focus of his own. Also working in the store is teenager Carmen, whose wages go to her abusive father. Because her father does not want her beyond her money earning ability, Carmen lives at the store with Cecile and Antoine. But quietly behind the scenes is the ever seeing Benoit, Cecile and Antoine's nephew who also works at the store and who in his pubescent state is in lust with Carmen. The one person who they probably will not see this Christmas season is Jos Poulin. Like all the other men in town, Jos worked in the asbestos mine, which he hated. As such, he has since left his loving wife Elise and his five children behind to go work in a logging camp. But real life still happens in the Poulin family during his absence, a specific situation which Antoine and Benoit must deal with and which threatens to expose the insecurities in the primarily publicly stoic Antoine.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In a genre by itself, this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal coupled with a subtle undertone which permeates the entire production. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art. Capturing a time in Québec rarely seen in movies, Mon Oncle Antoine's strength lies in the depth of its characters and the richness of the settings. Duplessis' Québec, parochial and feudal, is brilliantly cast as the backdrop which could not possibly be achieved by anyone other than a pure laine Québecois.It would be far too easy to resort to stereotypes, clichés and single-minded myopic statements in this story. Yet the director chose to skip the forced imagery and instead, focused on the essence of life in rural Québec of the time. That makes this film exceptional in its authenticity while not being pretentious in its presentation. If only more contemporary cinematic endeavors would do the same, the viewing public might not be forced to choose between the over-hyped Hollywood Pablum that passes for 'Must See' viewing.Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Québec. A classic. **********************************************Follow-up: 10 May 2008After reviewing some of the comments, it's worth noting Mon oncle Antoine is NOT - and probably wasn't MEANT to serve as standard Hollywood/American cinema for mass market sales. A coming of age story, yes, but far more than simple memoirs of adolescence in 1940's Québec. Viewers who're looking for sheer entertainment at the expense of complex development of the characters will be sorely disappointed. Go watch action/adventure/romance/comedies to be amused. Watch Mon oncle Antoine to be drawn into a seldom seen, but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long.The Grapes of Wrath is hardly an edge-of-the-seat thriller, yet the story and characters are what makes this American classic an enduring film. Mon oncle Antoine is in the same genre.</p>
