<p>Two over-loyal Celtic fans kidnap their opponent's star player in order to guarantee their team the championship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two die-hard Boston Celtic fans go out of their way to mess up the star player before game 7 of the Finals, and then accidently kidnap him. Not deep, but it doesn't have to be.A movie that a good sports fan would find as humorous, but a movie fan would only find forgetable. Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans all turn in entertaining performances, but the true star of the movie is....Christopher McDonald. He made me laugh my head off with the "Uhhhhhhh I hate my life" line. Akroyd doing the "Shakacon" thing was hillarious, as was his dream.Overall, it was enjoyable, but proceed with caution.***+(3.5)/*****(5).</p>
