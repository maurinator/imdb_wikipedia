<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It isn't often that I would say that a film has almost no redeeming value. Sadly, this is one of those cases.  "Knights of the City" has virtually nothing going for it.  The story is pretty bad and rather uninteresting. The characters are decent, I suppose, but nothing spectacular.  The acting is far from top-notch, but I've seen worse.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the cast is made up of unknowns (and this was made back in 1986...so they've all had some time to make a name for themselves).The only cast member that I did recognize is Janine Turner from "Cliffhanger" and must I say that she is the ONLY reason to watch this film. Janine looks absolutely fantastic in the film.The ending to the film is unbelievably unsatisfying.  The whole point of the film was that these a-little-too-old-to-be-gang-bangers wanted to get out of their wasted lifestyle and do something meaningful.  But in the end, they basically threw it all away and stuck with their barbaric ways...at least they have each other right?  ...And the main guy (Leon Isaac Kennedy) didn't even get the girl in the end!!!  I guess I have to give the makers some credit for not being predictable and somewhat ballsy...but this was just stupid if you ask me.I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are really into the look of Michael Jackson's "Bad" Music Video or films like "The Warriors" (1979).  I thought this film was rather laughable and obviously made in the 1980's.  If for some reason you MUST see this film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris</p>
