<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Redeeming all at once,the adolescent film,the film made up with sketches and the B-movie horror genre,it was too good to be true.And however,"campfire tales " could have done all that.Preceding "the sixth sense",the film recalls,more than "Jacob's ladder" ,the obscure "carnival of souls " (1962)."Campfire tales",like the three movies mentioned has an ending with coup de théâtre,completely unusual.So why  is half of the movie routine and business as usual?OK,the honeymooners are useful for the plot,but their whole sketch has no real connection with the main story.The same goes for the little girl surfing online and her dog.On the other hand,the last sketch is at once scary and significant:its conclusion magnificently segues into that of the whole movie.One marvelous scene:one of the boys is getting cold and he asks the girls to share their blanket:isn't it it an extraordinary clue?A lot of directors would dream of such a trick.Had the film had an internal cohesion,had he used all its sketches as it did for the last one,it would have solved the squaring of the circle and the three -despised- genres,which I mention above ,would have been enhanced.Yes,it was a heaven sent opportunity.Try to see it anyway ,it deserves better than its poor rating.</p>
