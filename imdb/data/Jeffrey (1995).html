<h1>Jeffrey (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jeffrey, a young gay man in New York, decides that sex is too much and decides to become celibate. He immediately meets the man of his dreams and must decide whether or not love is worth the danger of a boyfriend dying.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, a single gay Manhattan-based actor/waiter, loves sex. But the AIDS scare has made sex less fun in his multiple sex partner universe. As such, he decides to become celibate, believing that all his excess energy will be directed at other just as important aspects of his life, like his career. His interior decorator friend Sterling believes what Jeffrey needs instead is a boyfriend and a life of monogamy to take the AIDS scare out of his life, much like Sterling himself has done with his life partner relationship with chorus boy, Darius, who, although, is HIV+. But partly in viewing Sterling and Darius' lives, Jeffrey realizes that even more fearful to him than contracting AIDS is being in a relationship with someone with AIDS with who he may fall in love only to have that person die on him. After Jeffrey makes this celibacy decision, he meets who would have been his next Mr. Right Now if not *the* Mr. Right in the form of Steve, who, in turn, sees Jeffrey as potential boyfriend material. What makes Jeffrey's decision about what to do about Steve is the fact that Steve too is HIV+. Partly in light of Steve, Jeffrey has to view critically his decision and how he will lead a fulfilling life as a gay man. In addition from Sterling and Darius, Jeffrey gets some professional and non-professional advice along the way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jeffrey should have been a major massive blockbuster, a sure-fire smash hit, just take a look at some of the names on the cast, Christine Baranski, Patrick Stewart, Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy, Nathan Lane and Olympia Dukakis, yet it failed to set the queer or the straight world alight. Jeffrey a gay romantic comedy from America came out in 1995/6 and was based on a Paul Rudnick play about a young gay New York guy who considers sex is too dangerous in the days of AIDS and commits to a life of celibacy. Just to throw a spanner in the works and pad the film out another hour he meets the man of his dreams, whom surprise surprise just happens to be HIV+.It starred Steven Weber who was nice enough as the insipid Jeffrey an actor/waiter who is supposed to be AIDSaphobic, which just does not wash. Michael T. Weissis handsome and some nice eye-candy but you just wish he would get on and so something, anything as this film drags on and on and ever on. It would have been a total flop and dire mess on the floor of movie history were it not for the dozens of big names doing small cameos - Olympia Dukakis, Robert Klein, Nathan Lane, Kathy Najimy, Kevin Nealon, Ethan Phillips, Sigourney Weaver and Christine Baranski for example.
