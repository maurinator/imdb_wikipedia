<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is pure fantasy. As an Elvis fan it made me think what if Elvis had been confronted with his past towards the end of his life? The end of the film I found to be sad as we all know what happened to him and wished it were otherwise. The music is very good, as are the performances. This is in my top 30.</p>
