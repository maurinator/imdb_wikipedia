<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>No Retreat, No Surrender was a fantastic film which is one my absolute favorites. It reminds of the equally great The Karate Kid and Rocky 4 starring Sylvester Stallone. These three films came out during the mid 80`s and as we know most of the finest film was made from 84 to 90, No Retreat, No Surrender was no dissapointment.   When i rented it the first time when i was 12 me and my brother watched it 7 times in one day. The film is full of comedy and moving moments and the subject of martial arts is right down my alley, all around this is an  outstanding picture that has all the right elements. The fact that most of the players are unknown doesn`t make a difference, they fit right in this film.Kurt Mckinney is very fine in the lead role.</p>
