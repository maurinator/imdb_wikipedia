<h1>Mademoiselle (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a French village, Manou is an Italian logger, virile, with a broad laugh. He can't say no to women's sexual invitations, and jealous villagers blame him for recent fires and a flood. He is innocent; the culprit is "Mademoiselle," town schoolmarm, a recent arrival admired by all, but sexually repressed and obsessed with Manou. She sets the first fire accidentally and throbs watching a shirtless Manou perform heroics. Subsequent catastrophes are no accident and express her mad passion for him. Also, after befriending Manou's son, she turns on the lad, making him miserable and raising his suspicions. Her designs, Manou's frank innocence, and the town's xenophobia mix explosively.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Did you have a sadistic teacher? I did, but no one that goes to quite the depths of depravity that this one does. Her bullying of the boy in class is very much like what I have seen in my lifetime in school. Wonder if the writer actually had some similarly demoralizing experiences and therefore wanted to make a point of the stupidity of the masses when someone 'acts respectable'.I was cringing at the horror in this movie all the way through it. The man refusing the teacher his sexual favors was not made clear to me at all, as I thought they had 'done it'. Still, you wonder why there was no effective authority in the town. The policemen were like boy scouts, bicycling ineffectively all over the town.This really reminded me of the lynching mentality of some of the small towns in Alabama, where I grew up. Oh, if only they had a lawyer there such as the father in "To Kill a Mockingbird". In this movie they killed a rabbit, and more. It at least was not a formula movie, as there were unique touches all the way through. I will have to see it again.</p>
