<h1>Next to No Time (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Unassuming planning engineer David Webb finds himself on the Queen Elizabeth to New York with instructions to negotiate a high-powered loan. His lack of confidence means he is completely out of his depth, at least until he finds his personality changes every day during the hour the ship's clocks stop to make allowance for their westward passage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was made during the era when traveling by ship was glamorous and the purview of the rich.The exterior scenes were filmed on Queen Elizabeth,which ended up on the bottom of Hong Kong harbour.The interiors seemed to have been filmed on the smallest stage on Shepperton.Kenneth Moore is woefully miscast as a scientist trying to clinch a deal with businessman Roland Culberson.Also on board is Betsy Drake whose sole claim to fame is being married to Cary Grant for thirteen years.Familiar names come and go but the script gets worse.It finally sinks with all hands.Nowadays cruises are for everyone so there is nothing special about them,like this film.</p>
