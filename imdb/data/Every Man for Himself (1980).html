<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Somewhere about thirty minutes into the movie it struck me how much Godard loves something about movie-making.  That's a rare feeling -- to watch a movie and feel the director's love, passion, or fascination for/with the medium.  There's a character named Godard in the movie.  He's a director. At one point, he says, "The only reason I make movies is because I haven't the strength to do nothing at all."  One thinks that the Real Godard would have us believe the words were coming from him.  BUT seeing his frames, his cuts, the way he sets the light -- the inventiveness of all of it -- you just feel his joy in the enterprise.</p>
