<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Candice Bergen and Giancarlo Giannini star as two people from very different worlds who fall in love in A Night Full of Rain. When romantic Italian journalist Paolo (Giannini) rescues American photographer Lizzy (Bergen) from a scuffle in an Italian village, his efforts at romance lead nowhere. But when the couple meet again in San Francisco, Paolo does succeed in wooing Lizzy. Now, can their love overcome the differences between the traditional Italian Communist and the modern, liberated American woman that threaten to tear the two apart?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A review of a young couple's life, in flashbacks, from the beginning in Italy to San Francisco and back, in love, in denial, in the struggle to come to terms with life itself.Lina Wertmueller's direction dives right to the heart of the angst of love, its feeling of closeness and its opposite feeling of being unable to fully connect, an impossible dream of emotional need clashing with the physical isolation of each.Candice Bergen and Giancarlo Giannini are particularly magnificent in the violent, extended fight on the night full of endless rain.Their friends, often seen as groups of faces, provide a Greek chorus of comment, detached and occasionally mocking.This is yet another terrific reason to keep the VHS player working!</p>
