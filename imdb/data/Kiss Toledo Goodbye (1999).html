<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ok, for starters, I live in Toledo, Ohio. No-I'm not going to go into one of those righteous rants about how much better my city is, personally I don't care that much..but COME ON! It didn't even look like Toledo...all the high rises were wrong and our downtown area doesn't have cute little Italian family eateries, it's dilapidated and dirty. For the most part suburbia is in Maumee. Also, the mobsters from Detroit were totally unbelievable, and I hate to say that because I love Christopher Walken. I thought maffioso's had to be fairly intelligent... To be nice-Living in Ohio isn't the same as being retarded. We have our share, but really! Rent at your own risk, better yet, wait until it comes on network tv.</p>
