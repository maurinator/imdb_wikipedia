<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, but I only saw it about a year after it's release, but before Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out in theaters. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's performance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 9 out of 10, a fantastic movie.</p>
