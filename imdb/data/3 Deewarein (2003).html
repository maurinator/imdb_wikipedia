<p>3 deewarein(3 walls)stands out as the best acted movie in Indian Cinema.Such fantastic movie & its so underrated.Way too underrated.Brilliant performances from all the star-cast.Nasarudin Shah is a legend.I always expect these kind of performances from him & i always get such great returns seeing his movies.Juhi has made a great comeback after a very long time.Awesome performances too from Nagesh himself(the director) & Jackie Shroff.Gulshan Grover has too given a terrific performance.Such calmness in his acting in this movie that its so refreshing.Nagesh has directed this very well.The script is also very good.This movie surpasses all Indian thrillers.Even you can say this movie is the Shawshank Redemption of Indian Cinema.Epitome of performances with a great plot & a terrific surprising ending makes 3 Deewarein a class movie.</p>
