<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>*Don't worry, No spoilers!* I loved this movie. Of course when I saw it I wasn't expecting anything really life changing, so you shouldn't either. It is just a fun film that is perfect for a teenage audience. I couldn't believe it was on the $5.50 rack at Walmart! If you're not into teen dramas then I don't recommend this film, but if thats your bag then go for it! It reminded me of the movie "Saved!" mixed with a little bit of "Say Anything". Trent Ford is unbelievably cute in it, which led me to renting the film "Deeply" which is also a very romantic movie. I do recommend you to keep a box of tissues on hand, I cried like a baby at one point. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
