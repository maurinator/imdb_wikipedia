<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Larry Donner is an author and writing professor who tutors people that want to write books. Larry's life has become a misery when his ex-wife Margaret has published a book he wrote under her name and has gotten rich over it. Owen Lift, one of Larry's students, offers Larry to kill Margaret, and in return Owen, wants Larry to kill his horrible mother. Larry thinks it's a joke, until he learns Owen killed his ex-wife. And Larry has now become the prime suspect.</p>
<p>Two men have someone they would dearly love dead; one his ex-wife who is making his life miserable, the other, his domineering, nasty mother. What could be simpler than exchanging murders to avoid any possible complicity. Momma turns out to be a hard nut to crack, not to mention the guilt.</p>
<p>Larry Donner, a college teacher, has been having difficulties writing since his former wife, Margaret, ruined him by stealing his novel which consequently became a best-seller. He does not hide his hatred for Margaret, upsetting his girlfriend Beth Ryan, who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college. While teaching Creative Writing classes, he is stalked by a student, Owen, who wants to know his opinion about his crime tale. Larry tells him that he did not like it, and explains that in every mystery tale, the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. Furthermore, Larry suggests that Owen watch Hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. Owen, who wants to kill his detestable mother, watches "Strangers on a Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and while in a ship, Margaret falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while the deranged Owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal.</p>
<p>A bitter ex-husband and a put-upon momma's boy both want their respective former spouse and mother dead. Who will pull it off?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For those that recall those lines, you also know how entertaining this film was.  What happens when you take Hitchcock style suspense and paranoia and mix it in with traditional ,theatrical style comedy.  You get "Throw Mamma From the train.  This is the story about two guys with the same problem.  Larry Donner (played by Billy Crystal) is suffering from severe writters' block, brought on by the success of the novel that his Ex-wife (Make Milgrew) stole from him.Owen Lift (played by Danny DeVito) is suffering from the ability to write because of his nasty, demanding, over-bearing mother (played by Ann Ramsey).Larry, who is Owens' creative writing teacher, tries to advise him on the the fundamentals on writing a good murder novel.  His one tactic is for Owen to see a Hitchcock film and understand the importance of motive and alibi.  Owen takes the advise the wrong way and thinks that Larry wants him to participate in a criss-cross murder plot for the other. And the mayham begins.Billy Crystral does some of his best work in this film as he goes through a rollercoaster of emotions from all the madness he endures. Danny DeVito comes through, not only as the simpathetic Owen (who is quite distant from his popular Louie DePalma persona) but also as director.  DeVito uses not only his keen understanding of comedy, but also some clever camera techniques.  Ann Ramsey is the quintessential mother from Hell.  She's so mean and nasty that she makes you want to jump in and squeeze the life out of her yourself.  The film is also complimented by the Art Direction of Barry Sonninfeld (director of the Adams Family films) and a memerable musical score by David Newman."Throw Mamma From the Train" is slap-stick, suspense filled semi-classic that no fan of these talents should pass up.</p>
