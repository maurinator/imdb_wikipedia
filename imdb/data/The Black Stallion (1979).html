<p>1946. While traveling with his card shark father aboard an ocean liner off the north coast of Africa, pre-teen Alec Ramsey becomes fascinated with a spirited wild black stallion being housed inside one of the upper decks. During a storm which claims the lives of many of those aboard including Alec's father, Alec is thrown overboard and eventually washes up on a deserted island along with the stallion. Although they initially treat each other with trepidation, Alec and the stallion, who he names Black, eventually form a symbiotic relationship and friendship. Alec credits Black with saving his life and keeping him alive. They are eventually rescued and brought back to Alec's home in the suburban United States. Alec quickly discovers that a suburban American backyard is no place to house a horse. By happenstance, Alec meets farmer Henry Dailey who offers to house Black for him. Alec learns that Henry was once a horse trainer and jockey. Together, they begin the improbable tasks of training Black to become a race horse and training Alec to be Black's jockey, all in an effort to show the world that Black could be the fastest race horse in the world, despite his wild upbringing. These goals are beyond their other obstacles, including Black having no official papers, and Mrs. Ramsey having to provide her consent for Alec to embark on this journey.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was so afraid to see this movie.  The Black Stallion books defined my life until I was about 14 years old, if not longer (they have always continued in my memory).   I read every single book that Mr. Farley wrote, most of them many times over, and I knew every character intimately - how they looked, how they talked, everything about them.  And The Black - I know exactly how The Black looked and acted.   So - when this movie was announced, 23 years ago, I refused to see it.  I could not risk having all of my childhood memories shattered in the course of a 2 hour movie. But recently, in a discussion of favorite movies, a friend mentioned this movie as her favorite.  Immediately, I was interested.  So, nervously, I rented the movie, and settled in to watch it.  My heart started pounding as the opening credits rolled - I was almost breathless waiting for it to start.  All I can say is, now that I have seen it, I hate myself for waiting so long.  Every detail of the book is captured perfectly, as if Mr. Copolla, Ms. Mathason, et al managed to film all of the images in my head and pour them onto the screen. The cinematography is astonishing, the score is beyond compare as to how well it fits with what is happening on screen.  These are the technical details of the film - what is impossible to describe is just how closely this work captures the original book.  There is no whiz-bang gadgetry, or special effects, although some young ones may find the shipwreck sequence to be frightening.  It is a beautiful story, told masterfully.</p>
