<h1>Gumnaam (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After dancing together in a night club, seven young people (five men and two women) are told they have won the night's dance contest and are instructed to board a small plane that will take them to their prize holiday. Instead, they end up stranded on a small island with one of the plane's co-pilots. In search of shelter, the eight go to a mansion where they meet a sinister-looking butler who announces that he knows all them and has been expecting their arrival. After a few musical numbers, castaways begin dropping dead one by one. Who could the killer be, and will any of them escape his grasp?</p>
<p>Ten people from various walks of life are invited to spend a weekend on an island completely free of charge. All of them accept this invitation, and soon arrive on the island. They are met there by a butler and his wife, and there is no sign of the host nor the owner of the island. The guests decide to settle down and enjoy their holiday. The next day one of them is found dead, and it is then they realise that they have been invited to their respective deaths - one by one - by an unknown assailant, who could well be one of them.</p>
<p>Eight people are trapped on an island when their plane abandons them. They find a large mansion whose butler is expecting them. Then one by one, they die...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Basically an adaptation of Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians," this film is highlighted by one of the greatest, most euphoric rock 'n' roll dance sequences ever, which was featured in the opening credits of Terry Zwigoff's excellent "Ghost World."Of course nothing can be taken seriously here, as the characters get murdered one by one, they still find the time to have a beach party and stage elaborate musical numbers.  There are some terrific musical fantasy numbers, but of course the "Jan Pehechaan Ho" scene featured in "Ghost World" is by far the best.</p>
