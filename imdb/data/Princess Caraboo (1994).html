<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A true romance, twisted up in a mystery.  Phoebe Cates is luminous and graceful, and the supporting cast is perfectly chosen.  Kevin Klines "I speet in your soup" line never fails to crack me up.  A perfect combination of romance, comedy, and mystery, all in one little known movie.  This movie is a must see!</p>
