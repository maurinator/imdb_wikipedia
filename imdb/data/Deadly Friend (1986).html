<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Deadly Friend is not a bad movie. Looks like alot of critics did not like this movie. But why like a movie like scream? Those movies did not make any sense. Deadly friend had some great scenes. The best I would say is when Sam jumps out the window to attack Paul's friend. This movie had some scary moments. I feel it was overlooked by alot of people. Wes Craven makes good horror movies. He did a great job with this movie. It's really worth watching.</p>
