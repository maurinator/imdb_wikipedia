<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Babylon is a slice of Black British life in London in the late 70s and early 80s and given the Brixton riots of 1981 this film was strangely prescient. The film revolves around racism from police, violence against blacks, poverty and disillusionment and reggae music.Brinsley Forde from the reggae group Aswad and who had also been a child actor is a garage mechanic by day and an underground DJ by night. The film follows him as he loses his job as a mechanic, gets beaten up by police, is falsely charged, and forced to go on the run where he ends up in even more trouble.Along with Forde, you have Mel Smith, Karl Howman, Maggie Steed and Trevor Laird as the better known performers.Whilst Forde's downward spiral is predictable it is well paced film, the footage of London of that time now belongs to another era. The use of music especially reggae music is an important ingredient in the film with famous Black DJs of the era making an appearance in the film.It is low budget and harks back to another era although the message is still valid today. It deals with the issue of black racism. The racism here is open whereas today it might be more covert. Interesting to note that this are not black youths involved in a life of crime but getting by in an inner city during a recession, low paid work by day and their love of music at night.The film by Martin Stellman and Franco Rosso which is rarely shown on British TV is an important document of 1980s British film-making.</p>
