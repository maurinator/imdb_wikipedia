<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ok, is this movie cheesy?  well, yeah.  But it's one of those films I rented when it first came out and I kind of enjoyed it (come on, the cop is the same guy who played max headroom).  It has it's cheesy moments, not to mention parts that aren't believable (would the whole town really be ok with just staying up playing cards in some hotel lobby?), not to mention how they somehow had such an accurate tracking system they knew down to the penny how much loot they stole?  Nothing ground breaking here, but still a good film.</p>
