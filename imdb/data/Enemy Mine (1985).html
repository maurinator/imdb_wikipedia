<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was fortunate to come across this wonderful movie in the late 1980s and have since viewed it a few times. It has always been on my list of favorites. Although I now feel it may have dragged a bit, the combination of special effects, fine performances and the poignant message it sends, makes this film worth seeing. For parents, this is a movie that instead of focusing on blood and guts and the misguided lesson that blowing up people is something to cheer about, teaches that learning to love your enemy is the finest reward.</p>
