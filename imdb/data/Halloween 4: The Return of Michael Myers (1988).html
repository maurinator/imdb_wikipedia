<h1>Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's October 30, 1988 and Michael Myers has been in a coma since his pursuit of Laurie Strode, 10 years ago, was finally stopped (events of H1 and H2). However when he is transfered from Richmond Mental Institute to Smith's Grove he awakes when he hears that he has a niece in Haddonfield and after killing the transfer crew he escapes. In Haddonfield, the niece, Jamie, has been adopted by the Carruthers family but keeps having nightmares about Michael (but she doesn't know who he is). On Halloween night, Jamie goes out trick and treating, little knowing that her murdering Uncle is following her and her step-sister Rachel. Rushing to her aid is Dr. Loomis and with the help of Sheriff Meeker starts to search the town for Michael and to find Jamie to protect her. But can anything stop Michael this time?</p>
<p>Michael Myers is being transmitted from Richmond Mental Institute, when he breaks free, and goes after Jamie Lloyd. Jamie is the daughter of his late sister, Laurie Strode (the heroine of the 1st 2 installments). Due to her parent's deaths, Jamie is adopted by the Carruthers family, and Michael stalks out the teenage Rachel, and the young Harris. Dr. Loomis returns again to stop Michael's reign of terror.</p>
<p>It is October 30, 1988, and Michael Myers has been in a coma at the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium since that night a decade ago when his doctor set him on fire in Haddonfield, IL. An ambulance makes its away along the road to Ridgemont in a thunderstorm, and Myers is soon on his way to another hospital in Smith's Grove, IL. During the ride, he overhears the crew mention his young niece in Haddonfield, and he comes to life, savagely killing the crew trapped inside. Dr. Loomis & Dr. Hoffman, head of Ridgemont, are alerted by the state troopers after the ambulance is found upside-down in a river with blood everywhere. Meanwhile, Myers has already started to make his way toward Haddonfield, where he acquires his traditional coveralls & nasty-looking knife, confronts his niece in a pharmacy, and then kills the town's phone & power lines, leaving his niece & her adopted sister trapped in their home...and he's coming to pay young Jamie a visit.</p>
<p>Ten years ago he changed the face of Halloween. While being transferred from a mental institute, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddenfield, to kill his niece Jamie Lloyd. The power goes out all over the town, and Jamie and her step sister Rachel are locked in the house alone with Michael...</p>
<p>During a sanitarium transfer, Michael Myers murders his hospital escorts and brutally murders the staff of a gas station. Dr Loomis hears of the incident, and he is confident that Myers is planning to return to Haddonfield to kill his niece. He confronts Michael in the empty gas station, but he escapes. When Loomis finally arrives in Haddonfield, the sun is down and the children have begun trick or treating. He warns the police, and they, in turn, order the entire town into a state of curfew as they hunt for Myers. A group of rednecks leaded by a man named "Earl" attempt to capture Myers for themselves. As this happens, the entire town of Haddonfield falls into a state of darkness as a blackout occurs. Can they wit stand the devil in human form?</p>
<p>Ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers awakens and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece on Halloween. Can Dr. Loomis stop him?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well after that disgusting piece of filth called Halloween 3...we go back to the original story of Michael Myers and Haddonfield. Halloween 4 really took a step forward....and it scared me. the acting with "Most" actors was good, Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis was perfect as usual and Danielle Harris as Michael's Niece Jamie was very good and Ellie Cornell as Rachael Corruthers was also very good.They Original score was good but i believe i think they re-did it...Michael also did some good stylish murders in this one the only thing that disappointed me was the mask probably my least favorite mask in the series. Halloween 4 is worth watching so either buy it or rent it....now! Halloween 4 Is my fourth Favourite Halloween Film</p>
