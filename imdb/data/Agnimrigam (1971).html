<h1>Agnimrigam (1971)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very atmospheric horror thriller! A man movies into the ancestral mansion where his father and grandfather had been murdered years earlier. Soon he hers the cries of a ghost woman who seems intent on his death!Agnimrigam is very reminiscent of Universal's 1930s horror film or perhaps Val Lewton's moody horrors of the 1940s. Filmed in black and white the whole film has an effectively eerie quality.Sathyan and Sheela work very well together and the songs are all 1st rate! Highly recommended!
