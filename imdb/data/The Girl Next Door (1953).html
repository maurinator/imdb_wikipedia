<h1>The Girl Next Door (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stage-and-night club star Jeannie Laird (June Haver) buys her first home, and everyone who is anyone comes to her first garden party only to be blinded by smoke from next door. Jeannie charges next door to bawl out her new neighbor and meets comic-strip artist Bill Carter (Dan Dailey). Bill has devoted himself to his strip, and raising his ten-year-old son Joe (Billy Gray) since the death of his wife. Joe bases his strip on the everyday happenings of he and his son and is proud of keeping it scrupulously honest. When Jeannie and Bill fall in love, young Joe is hurt, especially when Bill starts using a lot of the father-son time to be with Jeannie. Bill cancels a father-son trip to Canada, and Joe decides to write a letter to Bill's syndicate pointing out that the current plot line of the script being set in Canada isn't honest, since they didn't go.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>GIRL NEXT DOOR is not your typical Fox musical. It's well done for what it is, but a little strange in that it includes a couple of animated scenes. Also a "dream ballet" ala OKLAHOMA!. The songs are unmemerable and the nightclub number in which June Haver and later Dan Dailey take part is like...unreal. How could all that scenery and visuals take place on a nightclub stage. Oh, I forgot..This is a musical. More like a musical fantasy in many ways. The one standout number has no dancing. Dan Dailey and Billy Gray as father and son sing a ditty while doing the dishes. They juggle and handle the dishware and silverware very cleverly. Don't know how many takes it took to do it, but it's a highlight of the movie and that bit alone is worth watching the film. Watch for the underused and underrated Cara Williams. A delight. Dennis Day, less so! Too bad this was Havers last film, as she had talent, although why her voice was dubbed after doing many earlier musicals is a mystery.</p>
