Over the course of their senior year, the girls cope with the usual trials and situations of growing up - like SAT's, test flights from the nest and the mysteries of romance.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Horrible movie. Horrible story dealing with the lives of New York's snobby rich kids.  Not at all a relateable story as the tagline "American Pie for Girls" would lead you to believe.  At least that movie had some things normal people could relate to.  Coming soon is just a bad movie that was banking on people watching it cause it was about sex.  Bottom line: horrible story, average at best acting, bad flick.</p>
