<h1>Blade Runner (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Video Game follows the first big case for new Blade Runner cop Ray McCoy. He is assigned to "retire" several escaped replicants but he soon finds himself questioning who he is when evidence starts to indicate he himself could be a replicant. It takes place during the same time the film does and involves many of the same characters. The game also has several outcomes all depending on the actions you take whether they be big or small.</p>
<p>You play a blade runner investigating a series of violent replicant crimes, only to discover far more than you bargained for.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like in movie, this game is telling a story about a Blade Runner. A special police unit/man that tracks down and exterminates illegal replicants who arrive on Earth from Off-World. First thing which struck me like a lighting from the clear sky was visuals of this game. Although they are pre-rendered 3d backgrounds, they deliver the mood and this noir-like feeling which was present thorough the film right down to your PC screen. You can and will recognize many places that were in the original Blade Runner (1982) movie. The voice acting... well, it's just perfect. William Sanderson, an actor, who was J.F Sebastian in the Blade Runner movie, is one of the voice-actors of this game. A really valuable effort from Westwood to hire on of the originals. As is actually whole plot which gives you some kind of options of how the game ends and how other characters react to you. It is interesting to notice how this game takes everything from the original concept and adds couple of it's own ideas, which are, fully suitable for this kind of product. Joseph D. Kucan did a great job on this game (the man most of us gamers will recognize as "Kane" from the Command & Conquer game series (he also provided voice-acting for Crazylegs Larry)) when he wrote whole plot. As the game advances, a Blade Runner fan will be caught in it. Certain aspects of drama are also present in this game, which is, very rare in game industry overall.I must recommend this to all those players out there who want a kinda once-in-a-lifetime gaming experience. And also, full recommendation goes to Blade Runner fans. Trust me, this is the game worth the Blade Runner license. The music, overall, is awesome. Thanks goes for Vangelis for their original score. In the last scene where everything is suddenly made clear to you... You will find out. This game is relatively old, made back in 1997 by Westwood Studios, but the age hasn't affected this one so much just yet. This is solely action/adventure game. With maybe a couple RPG elements in it. Kudos to Westwood for this. And no-thanks to EA for shutting down Westwood.</p>
