<h1>The Glory Guys (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the Sioux Wars, General Frederick McCabe's 3rd U. S. Cavalry Regiment is recruiting and training men for the upcoming campaign against the Sioux. Captain Demas Harrod is in charge of the D troop. He's also in-love with pretty Lou Woodard who lives in Mule City. Lou is engaged to Sol Rogers, chief of scouts under General McCabe. Lou doesn't seem to make up her mind regarding the man she really wants. She claims to be attracted to both men. This brings the two rivals into conflict that often times ends up into fist fights. At the fort, the training of men intensifies. After the graduation, the troopers get a well-deserved leave which they spend in nearby Mule City drinking heavily and causing disturbances. These disturbances prompt the town Marshal and his deputies to try to arrest the rowdy soldiers. A general fist-fight ensues, bringing Captain Harrod and chief of scouts Rogers together on the same side of the punch-up match. General McCabe participates in a commanders' briefing where a plan of attack against the Sioux is devised. McCabe is ordered to advance his regiment to a rendezvous point and wait for General Hoffman's regiment. He's told to refrain from attacking the Sioux without Hoffman's support. However, General McCabe is an ambitious man dreaming of glory. He secretly decides to rush his troops to arrive at their predetermined destination a day early. He intends to attack the Sioux without General Hoffman's assistance and therefore claim all the glory for himself. Unknown to him, the Sioux forces are much larger than previously estimated. General McCabe and his troops are in mortal danger.</p>
<p>What could be worse for two cavalry officers than to battle with native tribes? To battle each other for the same woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw this movie back in 1965 when it first came out and I have always had fond memories of it . It is definitely not as substantial as Wild Bunch, Sam P's masterpiece western, but it is an intelligent movie that builds great characters who make up the film.Tom Tryon is good as the maverick Captain who worries more about the lives and survival of his men then the prime directive of the General, played in his great evil fashion by Andrew Duggan. Harve Presnell,as Sol the scout makes a good foil for Tryon as they compete for the love interest,the widow Woodward, played by Senta Berger The standout characters to me are Slim Pickens as the long-suffering sergeant who must mold the misfits into a fighting troop, and a very young, brash James Caan as Dugan, the Irish ne'er do well, who becomes a soldier after all.Because of the time period the Indians are pretty one dimensional and uniform, unlike later movie representations like Little Big Man, but they do pull off clever fighting tactics and the hand to hand combat is fierce for its day.Like later war movies, the enemy is often the high brass or the law, just as much as the opposing forces.I could only find this movie in VHS, so I recorded it on my DVD recorder so I could keep it for posterity.</p>
