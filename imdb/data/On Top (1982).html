<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a big laugh comedy with some great music and fabulous acting. It's about two bands, a male band (Stuðmenn) and a female band (Grýlurnar) that go into competition about the Icelandic musical market.  It's a comedy about the things that you do and do not do to get attention from the fans and to be bigger than the opponent.  This film takes you to that year 1982, a big year in Icelandic musical history.  This is my favourite movie and it is so worth the watch.  I've seen it a million times and I never get tired. (Note:  The soundtrack (Með allt á hreinu) is available at all Icelandic music stores)</p>
