<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here's another great martial arts action film. Prior to the first AN, American Ninja 2, provide lots of action and suspense just like the first one. This time taking on "superninjas" they weren't so super to me there. Both Armstrong and Jackson(Michael Dudikoff and Steve James) were always on top of things. The Marines weren't so warm to the Army Rangers at first, but when it was getting the job done Armstrong and Jackson don't play around. Armstrong was all techniques, Jackson was all power, that's why he is later named "Powerhouse" Jackson. He was the martial artist with attitude. Especially when he stomped on the ninja and he said, "STAY DOWN!" You don't play with Powerhouse Jackson. The outside fight scene with Joe and the ninjas were memorable as well. I liked the part where Joe catches the dart with his hand and took out that ninja with the shuriken(throwing star). These characters were outrageous, they'll make any brawler run home to mama. This movie is just as good as first, however it does have more action though, which I like the best. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
