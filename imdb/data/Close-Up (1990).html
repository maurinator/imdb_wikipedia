<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this movie would be very healing to someone that has had to watch a loved one suffer with depression or commit suicide. It also would be beneficial to watch for anyone that has been depressed or maybe thought of suicide. This movie tends to show what happens to all involved. I think that our society needs more movies like this one, so we can have a better understanding of depression.</p>
