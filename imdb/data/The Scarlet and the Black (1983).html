<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Scarlet and the Black" is a must see for anyone who likes WW2 era films. It is also one of the greatest films ever made. The two leading actors Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer make this film even better with superb acting. Also I must admit that it is amusing to see "Captain Von Trapp" (Christopher Plummer "The Sound of Music") the Nazi hater as the chief Nazi of Roam. "The Scarlet and the Black" is a good film to introduce younger children to the true history of the Catholic Church and WW2. Although the Gestapo aren't as violent in the movie, they are still shown realistically as sadistic, hate filled men who followed evil orders. "The Scarlet and the Black" is probably the best film ever produced by Gregory Peck or Christopher Plummer. Sadly it is probably also one of the least known to the general population of the world, even though it tells a story that literally MUST be heard. If we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat it.</p>
