<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film begins with Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) walking down to a river, filling her pockets with rocks, wading in and drowning.  This will be the only lighthearted moment in the film.  After that it gets really depressing. It should have been titled "Frustrated, Suicidal Lesbians" but I doubt it would attract an audience.  It wallows in misery and self-pity and celebrates suicide and abandonment as legitimate solutions.  It also suggests that true genius can only come from neuroses.It is an unbelievable misuse of acting talent.  "The Hours" is how much of your life you will waste watching it.</p>
