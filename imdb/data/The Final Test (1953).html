<h1>The Final Test (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sam Palmer is a cricket player who is playing the last Test match of his career. His schoolboy son, Reggie, is a budding poet who disappoints Sam by not attending the penultimate day's play. Then Reggie is suddenly invited to the home of poet and writer Alexander Whitehead. Reggie fears he will also miss the final day - and therefore Sam's last innings - but it turns out that Alexander is a cricket fan.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sam Palmer (Jack Warner) is playing his last test for England's cricket team and his form has been below average recently. Then, as now, the Aussies are pouring on the agony for England and Sam desperately wants to sign off on a high note.This is a gentle comedy with a touch of drama. If you want to see how comedy works (and you understand cricket) watch the first 5 minutes. Senator Stanley Maxted arrives in England and makes his way to the Oval where he poses a few questions to deadpan Richard Wattis. The questions are standard cricketing enquiries (you mean they play for 5 days and it might still be a draw?) which could be cheesy but the delivery and Wattis' "matter of fact" responses make you laugh.Sam's cricketing prowess does not extend to his son who is more interested in poetry and this forms the backbone of the movie Â– does the son care enough about dad to watch his final innings? At the same time, does dad care enough about his son to appreciate his interests.Sam not only gives the umpire a lift to the ground but entertains him for dinner the night before (they wouldn't allow it these days you know). Sam also pops down to the local for a drink around closing time during the middle of the game - but he only drinks lemonade so that's alright then. Robert Morley (wearing a rather fetching jump suit) spices up the last third of the film as a vain, muddled poet.</p>
