<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some childhood memories may best be left in your childhood. I watched this movie several years ago and remember the creepy hearse. Sadly, it was the only thing going for this movie. The concept of the movie is very creepy and builds suspense with the mysterious hearse. I like a slow build which this movie had. The only problem about a slow build is that it needs to build to a solid ending. Sadly, the ending was pathetic is this movie.Some of the build didn't work very well either due to poor acting. I wasn't too enthralled with Trish Van Devere as the lead actress or David Gautreaux as her love interest. The best character in the movie was the creepy hearse driver. Of course, they couldn't give him much screen time or the movie would lose its suspense.There are much better movies in the ghost / haunted house subgenre. I would only watch this one after exhausting the higher quality ones.</p>
