<h1>Freddy vs. Jason (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's been nearly ten years since Freddy Krueger terrorized people in the dreams, and the towns folk want to keep him erased from their memory. Freddy still has one more plan on getting back to Elm Street. He resurrects Jason Voorhees and sends him off to kill. The more bodies which fall to the ground, the stronger in which Freddy becomes. This is until, Freddy realizes that Jason isn't going to step aside easily, and must be taken down himself.</p>
<p>Four years after being killed by his daughter, Freddy Krueger rests in Hell. He depends on the dreams of those in Springwood to fuel his existence. But when the town covers up his existence in an attempt to make people forget, Freddy is left powerless. In a last ditch effort he springs Jason Voorhees from his own personal Hell and sends him to Elm Street, determined to strike fear in the hearts of Springwood teens. But when Jason won't stop killing Freddy's "children," Krueger decides it's time to take Voorhees out. Caught in the cross-fire are Lori and Will, both of whom feature a history with Freddy.</p>
<p>The ultimate forms of terror are about to be unleashed once again. Dream demon Freddy Krueger is desperate to terrorize the teenagers of Elm St. once again, but he can't since the parents of Springwood have found a way to make the kids forget about him while doping them up with dream suppressant Hypnocil. So, in order to inspire terror, Freddy manipulates hulking, hockey-masked serial killer Jason Voorhees, through visions of his mother, to go to Elm Street and dispatch the kids so the town will think that Freddy has returned. But his plans don't go according to schedule when Jason starts to kill all of his "children," which really angers Freddy. And that's when Jason finds out that Freddy has used him, which really sends him over the edge. So, it's up to teens Will Rollins, Lori Campbell, and Kia, along with a few other survivors, to get Jason back to Camp Crystal Lake and Freddy out of the dream world for both of them to kill each other once and for all...</p>
<p>Freddy Krueger has been forgotten by the kids on Elm Street. Their parents have feed them anti-dreaming pills, making Freddy a thing in the past. So Freddy resurrects Jason Voorhees and sends him to Elm Street to create havoc, making people think Kreuger did it. When Jason steals some kills from Freddy, the latter begins to fight the infamous hockey mask-wearing killer. Meanwhile, the group of teenagers stuck in the middle try to figure out how to get rid of Freddy. This all leads to a climatic battle at Camp Crystal Lake, which should leave all satisfied.</p>
<p>Two of the most remembered eighties slasher film icons finally clash together on the big screen in a film fans have long been awaiting. Trapped in Hell when the authorities of Springwood manage to erase all evidence of his existence (and thus the fear that gives him his power), nightmare spirit Freddy Krueger comes across the soul of the equally infamous Camp Crystal Lake mad slasher, Jason Voorhees. Taking the guise of Jason's mother, Freddy resurrects him and commands him to start terrorizing Springwood, hoping to instill enough fear that the name Freddy Krueger gets out again so that the ensuing panic makes Freddy strong enough to return a seventh time. The plan works, but Freddy soon discovers that Jason, true to his nature in the past, will not stop killing, and is taking each of his victims. Determined to retake his position as the most feared killer in Springwood, Freddy devises a plan to sedate Jason into unconsciousness in order to battle him to the death. In the meantime, a small band of survivors who learn what's happening make their own efforts to not only ensure Jason's victory, but to return him to Camp Crystal Lake.</p>
<p>Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenage population. Except this time, they're out to get each other, too.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That's what I felt after seeing this film, Freddy Vs. Jason.  Right when they introduced the characters I knew them so well, their personalities, emotions, motives and all, that not one human character could have (or would have tried to) surprise me with ingenuity in their performances.  So, that's the downside to Freddy Vs. Jason, a downside that will either poke the viewer harshly in the ribs, or will just remain as the typical, expectedly lame backdrop for the match-up.  I felt a little of both, though I tried to be confident that the main show would be worth the Hollywood-ish mish-mash.The main show, however, is the only reason to see the movie:  Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund), the old gent from Elm Street, is down in hell wanting another grab at 'his' children, so he implements a sort of decoy in the form of lake-boy Jason Voorhees, who begins slaying far more than Freddy could want to see for someone other than himself.  So, he decides that it's time to kick some a**, and that's when the fun begins.  To die-hards of both series (I like a few from each series, and personally, I'm more for Freddy than Jason in the genre because at least Freddy can give some funny dialog in terrifying moments while Jason stares blankly, except for when his mother calls him) this is like seeing two legends standing up in the ring for a prizefight.  Each one has their weaknesses, but they each know who to throw their punches with style, and (we hope) that they can stay invincible until the last round.  I won't reveal who wins (they're enough skeeves on the message boards doing that), but what I can say is that if it only wasn't for the people in the movie (I'll exclude the Jay rip-off since he garnered the most laughs) acting so blandly, strategically like how they're told to do in such a piece, this would've been a near excellent horror movie.  Never-the-less, that could be considered moot, since that's what's to ALWAYS be expected for these gobledy-gook slasher pieces.  The point is, I didn't leave the theater feeling swindled by the hype of the matching (unlike how I would if they ever, EVER decide to make a Superman vs. Batman piece of drek).  C+</p>
