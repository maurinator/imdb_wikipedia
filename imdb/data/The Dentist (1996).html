<p>Dr. Alan Feinstone had everything, a beautiful wife, a huge house, and a wonderful job of being a dentist. That is, until he finds out that his wife is having an affair with the pool boy, and now his mind has snapped. Any plaque, tooth decay, or bad breath can set off his mind, and now if you have an appointment with the dentist, you better cancel it, unless you want to be dentally tortured.</p>
<p>An extremely successful dentist goes off the deep end after he catches his wife cheating on him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An emotionally gripping and eerie film. Bernsen deserves an award of some kind for his performance. This is an excellent watch even though the finale leaves a lot to question.I don't know about you but I found myself rooting for Feinstone for most of the movie (and not in a Jason way) because quite frankly who wouldn't lose it if they saw their wife giving a pool boy a b***job.</p>
