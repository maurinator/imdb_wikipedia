<h1>A Stranger in My Arms (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Air Force test pilot Pike Yarnell reluctantly attends the memorial service for long-dead Donald Beasley, his navigator during the Korean War; recalling, in flashbacks, their painful days together on a life raft. In Beasley's home town, Pike is repelled at Donald's wealthy mother's enshrinement of her dead son; bemused at his frankly amorous pursuit by Donald's younger sister Pat; and increasingly charmed by his attractive widow Christina. What will the final flashback reveal?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>June Allyson, Jeff Chandler, Mary Astor, Sandra Dee, Peter Graves and Charles Coburn star in this forgettable film. In fact, the only thing memorable about it, is that it is basically pretty awful save for some good performances by June Allyson, Jeff Chandler, and especially Mary Astor.Peter Graves is Mary's son and June's newlywed husband who went off to war and died. It is shown in flashbacks just how it all happened. Mary wants Jeff Chandler to recommend the Medal of Honor for her son and his sacrifice for his country. But Jeff, who served with him, has some issues in doing so.Just what makes this film so bad is the writing. Apparently this was based on previous material, but the dialogue was terrible, even from the very beginning. It's terrible to see all involved reduced to such embarrassing material. But, even given what she had to work with, Mary Astor still managed to come out looking better than her costars. That shows how great an actress she is. What tops them all is Sandra Dee as a girl trying to act grownup and throwing herself at Jeff Chandler. I still can't get over her character in this movie. The whole thing was an embarrassment for all considered. I give it a '3', I guess, because producer Ross Hunter knows how to cast a movie. The actors must have needed the money badly.But if you come across this movie and are curious about it, please walk on by! It ain't worth the 90 minutes of your life.</p>
