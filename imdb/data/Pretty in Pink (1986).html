<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Hughes knows the 80's.  And this proves it.  The film is a drama/comedy about a teenage girl and her problems in social and family life.  Though I am a guy, I identified with a lot of the problems and I thought there was so much to like in this film.  It's just that this is a little softer than the other Hughes films.  Maybe cause he didn't direct it.  Molly Ringwald gives her best yet and Harry Dean Stanton has never been more tender.  Good 80's film, but not in the best column.  By the way, Andrew Dice Clay appears as a bouncer, so pay attention to his part which highlights the film for me. A</p>
