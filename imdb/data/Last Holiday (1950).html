<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to see life as it is felt by the lower class in the United Kingdom.  The portrayal brings this mousy character to life, and who begins to live life as it should have been lived  in his earlier years.  It does have a moral, never put off today in hopes of a better tomorrow.</p>
