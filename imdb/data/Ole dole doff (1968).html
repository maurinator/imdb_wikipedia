<h1>Ole dole doff (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A weak and tormented teacher is pushed to the limit by his obnoxious students.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film is somehow scary, and I can't help myself for laughing at the stupid teacher, who is the character which you should feal sorry for. Even if the film is from 1968 it reminds me about my own time in school with old teachers, teaching the old way. A great film.</p>
