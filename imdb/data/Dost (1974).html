<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is about an idealistic guy(Dharmendra) and his street smart pickpocket friend(Shatrughan Sinha). Shatru was not a big star at the time and is in a supporting role but he thoroughly chews up and outshines Dharmendra. When I watched the movie, I was completely surprised by Shatru's comic talents. He rocks big-time as the wisecracking immoral thug. Watch out for the scene when Shatru goes to the employment office to seek job (after being coerced by Dharam) and his interaction with the officer there. Alas, his comic talents weren't quite explored by any other director and this guy himself started hamming in the later stages of his career. This is among Shatru's two finest performances('Mere Apne' being the other one). Watch it for Shatru. The movie is a joyride and Shatru makes it work.</p>
