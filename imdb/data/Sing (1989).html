<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the movies that you are embarrassed to admit you like, but you still secretly own and watch whenever you need a cheesy pick-me-up. The styles and dancing are decidedly 80's so it is probably due for a come-back. This movie is fun and the dancing is much better than I would have expected from a B movie. Peter Dobson's character as the strong, sensitive, misguided Dominick makes him all the more lovable.  I certainly would dance with him if I could. This movie is recommended if you, like me, are an 80's movie enthusiast.</p>
