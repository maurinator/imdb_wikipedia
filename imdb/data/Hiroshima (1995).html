<h1>Hiroshima (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry Truman, the successor to the Oval Office after the late President Rosevelt, is plagued with the decisions of war that could save or cost a thousand lives. He is then confronted with the nuclear weapons project, which he approves. As tension ensues (although it is difficult to get into this because most know the end) Truman must make the devastating desicion to use the bomb of all bombs. After some delivering japanese performances, Truman must force suffering on the japanese people again in order to end the war.</p>
<p>With the sudden death of FDR, Harry Truman finds himself thrust into the Presidency. He would be the first to admit that he was most unprepared for the job as FDR shared little or no information with him. He soon learns however of the $2 billion Manhattan project and that he will have to decide whether or not to use the weapon. With the war in Europe coming to an end, it is obvious that the new weapon would only be of use against Japan. Because it had never been tested, there was no assurance the A-bomb would work so the US also planned for an invasion of Japan. With the successful testing of the weapon in July 1945, Truman decides to proceed with plans to drop it on Japan with the view to bringing about their unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>The grisly events leading to the first attack with a nuclear weapon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found this masterpiece of a film by perusing the cable tv guide. Being a war history enthusiast, I was drawn to the content of the movie, only to realize that the production and actors and characters and images and storyline were equally well done. None of the performers are big celebrities, but that fact takes nothing away from their incredible performances and likenesses to the true people they portrayed. Kenneth Welsh as Harry Truman and Wesley Addy as Sec of War Stimson dominate with memorable renditions, but the entire cast deserves almost equal praise. I was not aware that President Truman was on a battleship when the uranium bomb descended on Hiroshima. The attitudes of American and Japanese leaders were nicely shown, and Truman's portrayed thoughtfulness and decisiveness were impressive. One of the infrequent 10's of my movie history. The docu-drama format gave the piece an even more realistic appeal.</p>
