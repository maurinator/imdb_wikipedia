<h1>Rogue Trader (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ambitious, wide-eyed boy Nick Leeson is determined to rise in the world and be more than a simple bank clerk. When his employers, Barings Bank, offer him the opportunity to go to Jakarta to sort out a problem that nobody else wants, he seizes the opportunity with both hands. In Jakarta he meets and marries Lisa and together they go to Singapore when the bank offers him the job of setting up their future options trading operation. To save money the bank allows Nick to operate both the floor trading and the back office facilities and force him to employ cheap, unskilled staff. His first year of trading is a big success and he makes large profits for the bank even though he has illegally broken trading rules and secretly covered up losses. Given more freedom, even more money and continuing unchecked, Nick starts to make losses and again attempts to trade out of them but this time he comes unstuck as his illegal trading generates even bigger losses. After the death of his unborn child Nick completely loses control and gambles without restraint with other people's money leading inevitably to a complete financial meltdown and the bankruptcy of the bank.</p>
<p>The story of Nick Leeson, an ambitious investment broker who singlehandedly bankrupted one of the oldest and most important banks in Britain.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film isn't bad, and if you at all interested in the case but know nothing about city trading then see it, if you do (unlike me) i'm sure you will be able to pick holes in it.  The one thing that you are left at the end, is the injustice for all the blame to land on his shoulders, he was daft, but there were others.  The sets are very good, dodgy boom mike holding, and very dodgy lines from Anna Friel, but she goes topless and so can be forgiven!</p>
