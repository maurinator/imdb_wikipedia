<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Teri Polo is cute, but wooden and overdressed. otherwise, John Travolta sleepwalks, Vince Vaughan is stonefaced, rather than menacing. Steve Buscemi's cameo was the best part of the movie. The plot is obvious, but contrived. The incompetence of the police is totally incredible.why this movie was made is unclear. It shares a genre with many better examples.</p>
