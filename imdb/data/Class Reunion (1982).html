<h1>Class Reunion (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lizzie Borden High's class of '72 are going through the motions at their tenth-year reunion, until deranged alum Walter Baylor, driven insane by a sadistic senior-year prank, escapes from the mental institution and crashes the party. When guests start getting bumped off, the other alumni, including snooty yacht salesman Bob Spinnaker, class tease Bunny Packard, and class zero Gary Nash, spring into action to uncover the culprit. Chuck Berry makes an onstage appearance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A mostly unfunny, one-joke spoof on the high school / slasher sub-genre that got to me not because of the lack of laughs, but to just how tediously uninteresting the story felt. I found the two stoner buddies (Barry Diamond and Art Evans) amusing enough and so of Gerry Graham's mannered performance along with Anne Ramsey's grouchy cafeteria worker. However for most part I found it a hard task to sit through, trying not to fast-forward (yep I was watching it on a VHS tape). Deliberately goofball in tone --- it keeps its quips quite crude, where the running gags only get repetitively stale and even embarrassing. The material was penned by John Hughes, where he sets up the situation quite well enough but then does nothing then rely on its random, if witlessly lacklustre occurrences and disappointingly screwed-up conclusion. The silly plot sees the class of 72 returns to their old rundown high school Lizzie Borden High for a reunion, but they are soon terrorised by a former student that recently escaped the loony bin seeking revenge for the prank that put him there. Michael Miller's direction is gimmicky, but the low-scale execution holds up better than it should and there's a high-energy soundtrack to boot. The cast is made-up of colourful, over-the-top characters; Michael Lerner, Misty Rowe, Miriam Flynn, Stephen Furst and Mews Small.</p>
