<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sir Robert Beaumont is behind schedule on a railroad in Africa. Enlisting noted engineer John Henry Patterson to right the ship, Beaumont expects results. Everything seems great until the crew discovers the mutilated corpse of the project's foreman, seemingly killed by a lion. After several more attacks, Patterson calls in famed hunter Charles Remington, who has finally met his match in the bloodthirsty lions.</p>
<p>In 1896 Lt. Col. John Paterson was sent to East Africa to build a railway bridge. He had a deadline to meet but was confident he and his large workforce of Africans and Indians can get the job done in time. John's was a man of his word and got things done - which he demonstrated on his first day by killing a lion that had been pestering the workforce. This earned John respect, but it didn't last very long because a few weeks later 2 new lions began visiting and they're man-eaters. The film is based on a true story and during the construction of the bridge, the lions would enter the workers camp to kill. Believing them not to be real lions, the locals name them 'The Ghost' and 'The Darkness'. After losing dozens of workers to the lions, the railroad company brought in Remington, an American 'great white hunter', to kill them, but even his reputation for being the best could not prevent yet more carnage. It is believed that over 130 people were killed by the two lions in just a few months.</p>

After 30 men have been killed Patterson's boss recruits a hunter, Charles Remington to hunt down and destroy the lions. But the lions continue killing the workmen until they flee the camps, jumping onto the train as it rolls through Tsavo. Now Remington, Patterson and his aide must face these brilliant yet frightening monsters alone.</p>
<p>A bridge engineer and an experienced old hunter begin a hunt for two lions after they start attacking local construction workers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Ghost and the Darkness" is based on an episode from the jungles of 1896 East Africa.  Various European countries are engaged in the process of establishing colonies in the wealthy lands of East Africa, and chief among those is Great Britain.Val Kilmer has been given a task--to build a bridge over a river in one of the British colonial ventures in East Africa.  When he arrives at the site, he learns that the task has been brought to a total halt by the presence of two man-eating lions the natives refer to as The Ghost and The Darkness.  These lions hunt as a team, and seem to have no fear of any outside force.  What's more, efforts to hunt them down have all ended in failure.  Kilmer enrolls the aid of an ardent big-game hunter, Remington, played by Michael Douglas.  Together, the two men set out to end the killing spree and thus allow the bridge to be built.The story is marked with violence, may be a bit squeamish for some, but the scenery and photography, coupled with a good story, makes it all worth while.  There is also a very unusual musical score, which adds to the background of the entire film.  On my own scale, a 9 out of 10</p>
