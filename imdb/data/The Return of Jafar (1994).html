<h1>The Return of Jafar (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Aladdin is adjusting to his new life as part of the upper crust. He and Princess Jasmine may not be married yet, but the pressures of palace society have already begun. On top of that, Iago (the parrot pet of Sultan's ex-vizir turned genie, Jafar) appears asking for help and no one is happy to see him. But things begin to look up when Genie returns from his trip around the world. Meanwhile, Jafar's black lamp is discovered by an idiot crook called Abis Mal. By using Abis Mal, Jafar makes his way back to Agrabah with ideas of payback for Aladdin and his friends.</p>
<p>Jafar comes for revenge on Aladdin, using a foolish thief and Iago's treachery to find a way back into power.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. Jonathon Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, Jason Alexander, Dan Castellaneta and even Jim Cummings all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a "good guy" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first. I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough. You could still tell what was going on. You should all stop complaining and realize that this is a great movie. Some parts were rushed and some parts were pointless but they do make up for it. It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse. The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans .</p>
