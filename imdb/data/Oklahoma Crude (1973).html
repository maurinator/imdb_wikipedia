<h1>Oklahoma Crude (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's oil boom time in Oklahoma and Lena Doyle, a hard-bitten, cyncial feminist has a fight on her hands: the big oil companies don't like the fact that she's working a potentially profitable wildcat rig. Reluctantly, Lena must accept the aid of her estranged father Cleon, and Mason, the man he hires to help. The three form an unlikely team: Lena hates men, Mason is out for himself, and Lena's father is trying to make up for a lifetime of neglecting his daughter. But together they take on the big guys and put up a terrific fight.</p>
<p>It's the early twentieth century. Lena Doyle is an independently minded woman who has no need for others in her life, men or women. She owns a piece of property on the Oklahoma plain on which she is speculatively drilling for oil. She is approached by Pan-Oklahoma Oil who want to pay her for the oil rights to her property, they figuring that they easily have the resources to drill a hundred wells, and even if one comes through, it will have made up their investment. Lena, however, vehemently declines their offer, wanting instead to drill on her own terms. Lena's decline of their offer leads to a stand off of sorts between the two. Although Lena does not want his help, her father, Cleon Doyle, who was largely not there for her when she was growing up, hires an itinerant oil worker, Noble Mason, to be her right hand man. Lena accepts both their help only on the condition that she remains the boss. What naive Cleon is unaware of when he hired Mase is that Mase is the type of person whose allegiance goes to the highest bidder, and as such he has no loyalty to Lena. But as the stand off between her and Pan-Oklahoma - led by the vicious Captain Hellman - increases, as Lena receives unofficial legal advice on the matter, and as Mase begins to get to know Lena, the two may begin to have a different type of relationship, one that doesn't have much of a chance against the wranglings of Pan-Oklahoma unless they do indeed strike oil quickly.</p>
<p>In 1913, in Oklahoma, oil derrick owner Lena Doyle, aided by her father and a hobo, is stubbornly drilling for oil despite the pressure from major oil companies to sell her land.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in high school and have been waiting for a video release ever since. The screenwriter, Marc Norman, created a masterpiece, and Stanley Kramer directs one of his best movies ever. A great mix of intelligent dialogue, social critique, and sexual politics.If you're a fan of David Mamet or HBO's "Deadwood," then you'll love this vulgar and profane bit of Americana. The leads play against type and pull off some really great performances. Scott and Dunaway are terrific together; too bad they never paired up again.If you think this is a one-off, consider this: Marc Norman would go on to win an Oscar for "Shakespeare in Love." Mr. Norman, can you use your clout to get a DVD release?This is a great little allegory about the constant struggle between artistic filmmakers (drilling for oil) and the finance people who stand around the edge of the set, taking pot shots, while waiting for the gusher to pay off.</p>
