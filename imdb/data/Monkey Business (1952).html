<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Barnaby Fulton is a research chemist working on a fountain of youth pill for a chemical company. While trying a sample dose on himself, he accidentally gets a dose of a mixture added to the water cooler and believes his potion is what is working. The mixture temporarily causes him to feel and act like a teenager, including correcting his vision. When his wife gets a dose that is even larger, she regresses even further into her childhood. When an old boyfriend meets her in this state, he believes that her never wanting to see him again means a divorce and a chance for him.</p>
<p>Barnaby Fulton, a chemist, is working on a youth formula for a chemical company by testing it on chimps. His very understanding wife, Edwina, helps him by being very supportive. His boss' secretary helps by displaying her legs, which are wearing Barnaby's indestructible hose. When Esther, the chimp, mixes her own formula, and it gets in the water cooler in the lab, the fun begins! Barnaby goes back in age twice, as does Edwina. Wild rides in a hot sports car, roller skating, jive dancing, and scalping Edwina's childhood boyfriend, Hank Entwhistle, all ensue. Barnaby and Edwina live happily ever after, supervising Esther's formula-making.</p>
<p>A chemist finds his personal and professional life turned upside down when one of his chimpanzees finds the fountain of youth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The picture centers upon a scientist (Gary Grant) and his wife (Ginger Rogers) , he discovers a potion with extraordinary effects making younger themselves . He is testing the rejuvenating formula on a chimp turning nutty . This film is an underlying screwball comedy united to : ¨Bringing up baby¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ and ¨His girl Friday¨ , all of them by the trio : Gary Grant-Gary Cooper-Howard Hawks and they are splendid .In the movie there are comedy , tongue-in-cheek , joy , giggles and is pretty amusing . From the initiation to the final the humor is unstopped . Gary Grant and Ginger Rogers' interpretations are top notch , both of whom are awesome comedy actors . Ginger Rogers is the number one as dancer actress , besides a fascinating comedian and she achieved an Academy award as main actress for her portrayal in ¨Kitty Foyle , natural history of a woman¨ . The support cast is first range , are the veteran Charles Coburn and a newcomer Marilyn Monroe who at her playing as an attractive and charming secretary demonstrates experience like future first star . Excellent storyline by Ben Hetch and L.A.I. Diamond , they're Billy Wilder's habitual writers . Howard Hawks' direction is very good , Hawks has classics on every genre , thus : noir genre (The big sleep) , Western (Rio Bravo) and comedy (Monkey business) . The yarn will appeal to comedy enthusiasts and Gary Grant fans . Rating: Above average . Well worth seeing.</p>
