<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked it. It was one of the best movies of Turkey. Especially, Cem Yilmaz's role was funny as hell. The director, Yilmaz Erdogan was also playing a role (idiot) in that movie. It was about the TV (televisions). There was a village in Turkey, and that village had been unaware of the invention of television. After some time, it was time to meet the black-box. However, It was easy to get a Tv, but  the folks didn't know how to run it, even if they did, scanning the channels was still being a problem. Fianlly, They decided that only the idiot-guy of the village could manage it, and thus, all comedy was begun. 9,3 /10</p>
