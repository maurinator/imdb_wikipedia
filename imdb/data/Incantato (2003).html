<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nello Balocchi, a 35-year-old teacher of Greek and Latin, is invited to Bologna by his father, the owner of the Papal tailor's shop in Rome. His father hopes Nello will find a soul mate in Bolgna and thus produce an heir for the business. Nello stays in a guesthouse run by Arabella, a wise woman who already knows all about his situation. He shares a room with Domenico, a crafty barber from Naples. After several unsuccessful efforts, Nello meets Angela, an exuberant, beautiful young blind girl with whom he falls hopelessly in love. The girl's father and Nello's parents do not approve of the relationship, but the real problem is Angela's temperament.</p>
<p>The Pope's tailor sends his son, a virgin at 35, to Bologna hoping he will find a woman. Nello, a classicist moved by the romantic poetry of Ovid, proves to be a good teacher and also falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Angela Gardini. Angela, herself recently blind and then spurned by her fianc√©, uses Nello: she hopes her former lover will become jealous and return to her. Nello obliges, his head full of poetry and in love at last; he's happy to be near her, knowing that she, before her disability, wouldn't have looked twice at him. Bologna or Rome, teaching or stitching, love or solitude - will Nello make choices?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While this movie has some good moments, I found both the plot and the pace of the movie uneven to the point where I was not engaged in the movie for most of the time. The lead actor is talented, so talented and so convincing as the sweet, lonely, and socially awkward 35 year-old he plays - at points in the movie - you feel bored of him and tired of his introversion and immersion in ancient poetry. The leading lady, while beautiful, does not deliver a convincing performance. That role required an actor with a broader range and she falls flat. There are, however, scenes that made me laugh aloud and all of them featured the legendary Giancarlo Giannini.</p>
