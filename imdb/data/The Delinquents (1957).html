<h1>The Delinquents (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Scotty White (age 19) must stop 'going steady' with Janice Wilson (age 16) when Janice's parents intervene. Frustrated, idle and without Janice's restraining influence, Scotty encounters Cholly and his band of disorganized, fun-loving delinquents. Soon he has Janice (who seems considerably the more mature of the two) mixed up in their doings, which begin to seem less and less like harmless fun...</p>
<p>High school senior Scotty White is a good kid. His mother worries about the influence of a local gang of trouble makers, they who cause a ruckus where ever they go, but his father trusts him to do the right thing if confronted by the gang. Scotty becomes despondent when the parents of his sixteen year old girlfriend Janice Wilson forbid the two from seeing each other. Mr. & Mrs. Wilson like Scotty but they feel Scotty and Janice are far too serious about each other than they should be at their tender ages. Out alone one evening, Scotty gets caught up with the gang when they help him out of an altercation where he was an innocent bystander. What Scotty does not know is that they were the initiators of that altercation. The gang is led by Cholly and Eddy, both thugs with a violent and sadistic streak. Eddy doesn't much like Scotty and does whatever he can to implicate Scotty in whatever wrongdoing. When things start to get out of hand with Cholly and Eddy, Scotty has to do something to get his life back while protecting Janice.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A frustrated young man, separated from his younger girlfriend, gets involved in a juvenile gang.Robert Altman wrote, produced, and directed this film in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri during the summer of 1956 on a $63,000 budget raised by local theater owner Elmer Rhoden. He was hoping to cash in on the juvenile craze that American International Pictures made popular with films such as "Hot Rod Girl" (1956) and " Shake, Rattle & Rock!" (1956). Indeed, the film is very much in the AIP style and could pass for one of their productions.As summed up by Altman, "I wrote the thing in five days, cast it, picked the locations, drove the generator truck, got the people together, took no money, and we just did it, that's all." Shooting was a bit of a pain, with Altman in constant disagreement with star Tom Laughlin (a Milwaukee native who went on to be known for the "Billy Jack" film series).Cameraman Charles Paddock, on Altman's advice, imitated the lighting of "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950). This is probably why the film looks more professional than it actually was. Despite anything it might lack, the photography is smart and sharp.United Artists bought the film for $150,000, earning it a quick profit before even hitting theaters. Altman maintained for years (at least up to 2001) that he did not care for the film, but Alfred Hitchcock of all people did and got Altman hired on for "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Success! Rhoden produced one more film in Kansas City -- AIP's "The Cool and the Crazy" (1958) -- and was even featured in Time magazine as one of the "new wave" of producers. He then produced a delinquency film in Hollywood featuring the debut of composer John Williams, AIP's "Daddy-O" (1958), but his mini-mogul reign was short-lived.</p>
