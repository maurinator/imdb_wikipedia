<p>In an overly commercialized future, desensitized to violence, the Detroit Police Department, now corporate-run by OCP (Omni Consumer Products), finds itself overwhelmed, near collapse, and ready to strike. Chief among criminals at large is Clarence Boddicker, who alone, amidst his psychopathic gang, is responsible for thirty-one police deaths. While OCP's president awaits the full collapse of Detroit so he can built his Delta City dream project over its remains in six months, two officials at OCP look toward high-tech solutions to the crime problem, with an old-school official developing a robot (Enforcement Droid 209) while an ambitious upstart develops a cyborg (RoboCop, fashioned from the remains of fallen police officer Alex Murphy). While ED-209 is a flop, RoboCop is a marvel, but violence escalates when an official at OCP, directing Boddicker's actions, needs the effective cyborg destroyed.</p>
<p>After Omni Consumer Products (OCP) announces that it bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and new partner Anne Lewis track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker. Unfortunately, Murphy is mutilated and killed by Clarence's gang. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's barely cold corpse into RoboCop (to compete with fellow employee Dick Jones' ED-209 robot). RoboCop's tests are successful. Unfortunately, RoboCop rediscovers his memories (when he was Alex Murphy) and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. When he realizes that Clarence is working for Bob Morton's company rival Dick Jones, RoboCop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones.</p>
<p>In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In a futurist Detroit, crime is high and the police are run by a massive private company, keener to reduce running costs than reduce crime.  When their new police robot ED209 develops a glitch, they turn to a prototype that blends human tissue with high-tech circuitry.  Meanwhile Police officer Murphy and his partner Lewis are out gunned by criminals leaving Murphy mortally wounded.  OCP take Murphy's body and use it to make Robocop.  However Robocop is so successful that he is targeted by criminal Boddicker.   Boddicker turns to his shadowy partners in crime, while Robocop struggles to deal with human memories and a programming system that seems designed to control him and keep him in the dark.Verhoeven's first US film was to set the mould for how the rest of his career would pan out - extreme violence and very little idea of restraint.  However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best (Starship Troopers) - ultra-violence, funny black humour, great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life.  Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top.  This is complimented by the sub-plot of him trying to rediscover his human side.  This is full of great action scenes and eccentric villains.The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best.  Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues.  His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's `glitch'.Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side.  Allen is good but a but dry.  The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses.  Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities.  Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times.A classic bit of sci-fi.  Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess!  This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste.</p>
