<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The movie follows the lives of a woman and a man starting from several generations earlier. The story spans a whole century and several continents.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is my lifetime favorite movie too, replacing its predecessor of early years, IF. I don't know how many times I've seen it, more than 20. I like the music, the evolution of film portrayed in the techniques used, the love at first sight but you need to know the history to understand why it happens theme, the fact that the movie he's making in the movie is the movie you're seeing, the intricacy, the detail, the irreverence. The last scene through the airplane window when he notices she takes the mythical extra lump of sugar always makes me cry. I rarely see this film around in video stores anymore. I want to see it again. Haven't seen it in maybe a decade.</p>
