<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this was a good story and plot at the time it was made in the 1960's. At that time there existed a lot of racial tension, especially from older adults that were used to traditional family values of yesteryear. During the period of the mid 1960's, the younger generation was not as concerned about racial and ethnic differences. The love generation transcended previous thinking and "imagined rules" of courtship. The theme of this movie tries to capture old family values vs. the new age of "anything goes". Unfortunately, the only time I viewed the movie was at the private screening. My band "Smokestack Lightnin' appeared in the movie in a club scene shot on location in a warehouse in L.A. We performed an original song. I also remember being slightly burned by the smoke machines being used while they were filming the groups performance on stage in the made-for-movie nightclub. I don't remember Danny De Vito, but he probably was there. Art Guy Drummer, Smokestack Lightnin'</p>
