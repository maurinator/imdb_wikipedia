<h1>Target (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chris Lloyd does NOT get along with his father Walter. Walter is too careful, cautious, and boring to Chris, and never tries anything new, and Chris had to live by the same standards when he was growing up. But when his mother is kidnapped while in Europe, to Chris's confusion, Walter suddenly turns into a man of action. Just who is his father anyway.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon star in this suspense thriller about a dad (former CIA and son who hunt for their kidnapped wife/mother..only problem is that this movie is neither suspenseful or thrilling... it just doesn't hold your interest..on a scale of one to ten..4</p>
