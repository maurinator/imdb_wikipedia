<p>Stuck-in-a-rut businessman Gene Hackman gets fed up with the rat race after being demoted from company executive to manager of an all-night convenience store. He longs to be an inventor, and ends up divorcing his non-supportive wife over speculation he's having an affair with his teenage son's married girlfriend, a flaky sexpot in lavender chiffon. Comedy-drama has some early promise but not enough jokes, and it starts to sag just 40 minutes in. Hackman displays his effortless charm, and Barbra Streisand attempts something offbeat--though it's a gamble which doesn't quite pay off, as we never get a grip on her wispy Cheryl. The picture is a cracked-egg: interesting conception and design, yet unsatisfactory. There are a handful of funny lines and trenchant bits of satire scattered about, and every scene in the drug store is ripe with possibilities which are then left unformed and unrealized. *1/2 from ****</p>
