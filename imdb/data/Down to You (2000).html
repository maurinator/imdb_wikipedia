<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not usually a fan of romantic comedies, but Down To You really is a great movie. It's funny, entertaining and has some very touching, romantic moments without being overly sentimental or chliched. Freddie Prinze Jr and Julia Stiles put in great performances, and they're backed up by a strong supporting cast of varied and original characters. The plot explores the 'tingles' of first love in a refreshingly mature and honest manner, without being trivial and stupid like some teen movies. A fantastic flick to watch on a girlie night in.</p>
