<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>THe role that made Mitzi Gaynor a star. As musical formulas go, this is as formulaic as it gets. But formula hath not make a bad picture. As with any musical, no matter how mundane or pedestrian the plot, good songs and singing can always save it. That is the case here, especially one song I can't get out of my head. You'll know it. It's played again and again as hollywood pro Lloyd Bacon uses it as a transitional device. All scenes are shot and edited well and all acting is good and Mitzi Gaynor delivers a star performance.</p>
