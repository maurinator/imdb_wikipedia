<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love talented child actors. I love fun family movies. I love sassy romantic comedy. This movie features none of that.Debbie Reynolds plays a Broadway actress who finds six kids and welcomes them into her home because they need a place to stay. The kids are obnoxious and out of control. Cliff Robertson as the local reverend who helps her with the kids is supposed to be charming but he comes off as didactic. I guess that's part of being a preacher. At one point, he says something like, "She's a woman; she should start acting like one." I was completely turned off by it. He wants her to give up her career in New York, stay in rural Connecticut and adopt six bratty kids. I guess the problem isn't really Cliff Robertson - it's the writing. As the entire premise of the movie is that she finds true love, then the objects of her love ought to be appealing. Nothing the reverend or the kids do are appealing to me.There are some high points to the movie. Reynolds is really cute and likable. She evens gets to sing a nice little tune. Some of the supporting characters are rather good. Eileen Heckart has some very funny lines that she delivers well. David Janssen is funny and charming. He is underutilized in this film. Alice Ghostley in a small role as a housekeeper is very, very funny.Perhaps it is just a product of its time. It does not hold up well.</p>
