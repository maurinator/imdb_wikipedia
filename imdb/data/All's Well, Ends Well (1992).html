<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is original All's Well Ends Well movie from Hong Kong, brought to you by veteran HK actor Raymond Wong. It is a family comedy about three Shang brothers. Eldest brother Shang Moon (Raymond Wong) is a philandering businessman who mistreats his wife; middle brother Shang Foon (Stephen Chow) is a playboy; and youngest brother Shang So (Leslie Cheung) is a gay dance instructor. Want the hilarity all all three brothers deal with their family and personal issues.Much of the comedy involves Chow as his typical and classic comedy sends up some laughable moments. While there is a good does of slapstick humor, there is some meaningful drama and romance. While this movie is probably the only one in the series that has a solid plot, the momentum is slow at times and some of the comedy is a little too nonsensical, especially the movie spoofs. But, it's not a bad movie to pass the time with.Grade B-</p>
