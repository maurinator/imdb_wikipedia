<h1>Married to It (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kimberly learns first-hand of Michael's affair with Sydney when she walks in on them in bed together, breaks up with Michael, and then tips Jane about it, which results in Jane shunning Sydney and Kimberly moving out of Michael's place. Meanwhile, the INS wants to pay Matt and Katya a visit, so she and Nikki have to move in with him right on the day when Matt has a date with Joel, an art gallery owner. When Joel finds out of the arrangement, he breaks up with Matt, but at least the INS buys Matt and Katya's story. Also, Jo and Steve continue dating while Alison is uncomfortable about seeing them together.</p>
