<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a true tear-jerker.  The songs are beautifully written and the performances are finely honed by all concerned.  The only problem is that you may have trouble finding it, because it's not shown on television very often.  But what a find it is!  Have a box of Kleenex handy; you'll need it.</p>
