<h1>Twins (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Julius and Vincent Benedict are the results of an experiment that would allow for the perfect child. Julius was planned and grows to athletic proportions. Vincent is an accident and is somewhat smaller in stature. Vincent is placed in an orphanage while Julius is taken to a South Seas island and raised by philosophers. Vincent becomes the ultimate lowlife and is about to be killed by loan sharks when Julius discovers that he has a brother and begins looking for him.</p>
<p>Many years ago, an experiment was conducted to produce a perfect human being. Unfortunately, there was a serious problem. The zygote split unevenly leaving two children - one with strength, brains, personality and love and the other one with what else was left! Both children were raised separately at different locations until one day, the two unite and help each other find their long-lost mother.</p>
<p>A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who is a short small-time crook.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a big Arnold fan so I enjoy most of his films and this is easily the best comedy he's ever done, one of the best comedies ever period! It deserves a much higher vote than a 5.9 I'd give it a 9. Arnold has been living on an island with his teacher for all his life till he finds out he has a twin so he goes and finds him and together they get Devito out of trouble, ok I didn't tell the story well but the movie is just hilarious and fun to watch Arnold and Devito make a good team.</p>
