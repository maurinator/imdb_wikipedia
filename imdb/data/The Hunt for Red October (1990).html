<p>This film tells the story of Captain Marko Ramius, the skipper of the Soviet Union's newest nuclear sub. Jack Ryan of the CIA gets involved in a tense, tangled hunt for this sub, when Ramius defects, taking the "Red October" with him. The story is an action packed techno-thriller.</p>
<p>Marko Ramius is a senior Lithuanian sub captain whose plans to defect are met with strong opposition by his own Soviet navy, and American misconceptions of his intentions. CIA analyst Jack Ryan, the one man who sees the defection, must convince most of the American navy he is correct. The action climaxes with an amazing naval battle, but who will win The Hunt for Red October?</p>
<p>A new, technologically-superior Soviet sub, the Red October, is heading for the U.S. coast under the command of Marko Ramius. The American government thinks Ramius is planning to attack. A lone CIA analyst has a different idea: he thinks Ramius is planning to defect, but he has only a few hours to find him and prove it--because the entire Russian naval and air commands are trying to find him, too. The hunt is on!</p>
<p>Red October is a new Soviet Submarine. When the Americans are given photographs of it, they are extremely curious as to why is it so special. Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, consults with a friend, who deduces that it's equipped with a new engine that can make it run virtually silent and with such a device, they can position themselves on the outskirts of any coastal city and launch their missles and not give their target any warning. Marko Ramius the sub's captain kills their political officer after they open their orders which basically has them conducting routine maneuvers but he kills him and burns their orders and replaces it. He then tells the crew that they are going to test their new engine by positioning themselves by New York and run missile drills. Ryan is then called by his boss to attend a briefing that concerns Red October. It is at this briefing that they discover that Ramius sent a letter to high ranking Soviet official, who after reading the letter went to meet with the Soviet Premier and it was shortly after that meeting that the Soviet navy was deployed to find Red October and sink it. Everyone assumes that Ramius has turned rogue but Ryan who once did research on Ramius assumes that he might be trying to defect. While everyone dismisses him, the National Security Adviser tells Ryan to go out there and find out for sure if he is right cause once Ramius is in position to fire his missiles they have take him out. Ryan reluctantly goes and is not use to fieldwork, is having a hard time coping with the sea. At the same time someone in the Red October crew knows that Ramius has deviated from his assignment and is doing what he can to stop him.</p>
<p>In November 1984, the Soviet Union's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect or to start a war?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fortuneately, this movie is not entirely true to Tom Clancy's vision and book.  Tom Clancy is an American superpatriot and nationalist.  He loves to gush about the superiority of the American military establishment and its high technology.  This movie puts a more sympathetic face on the Russians and the commoner's point of view.      Sean Connery plays a very likable Russian Submarine Commander.  Of course, Sean Connery is always going to steal the show in any movie.  He's kind of like the John Wayne of the last twenty five years.  But the supporting actors are also engaging as well.  Scott Glenn, Fred Thompson, and James Earl Jones all do very well at commanding our attention.  These actors always give strong, interesting, and dynamic performances.      With all the high technology and military hardware in this movie it is interesting to note how a simple seaman(an enlisted man at that!) solves the great technical puzzle in this movie.  All the officers, admirals, computers, aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and what have you are clearly stumped.  But, Jonesy, with simple reasoning and a keen intuition, solves the riddle that is the Red October.  Yes, he uses a computer to help him, but most importantly, he uses his mind!       The strength of this movie is that with all the gadgetry and high technology, the human element is not lost but is always on top.  Plus, it does not degrade into pro-American propaganda.  Because of this, I think that people who know nothing about the military or who don't even like war movies will find this movie enjoyable.</p>
