<h1>Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Around 1906, the widow Lilia Herriton meets a young man when she visits Italy and marries him. The man is only a dentist without a good name, and Lilia's relatives are clearly unhappy with her choice. Lilia dies while giving birth to a son, and two relatives travel to Italy to take care of of the baby, expecting no trouble from the father.</p>
<p>After a rich Edwardian widow impulsively marries a handsome but poor Tuscan dentist and dies in childbirth, her English in-laws try to gain custody of the baby.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Where Angels Fear to Tread is not the best E. M. Forster novel to be written, and it is certainly not the best to be made into a movie, but it is well worth watching for another superb performance by Helena Bonham Cater and her supporting cast.Rupert Graves (V for Vendetta) is excellent as an Edwardian aristocrat who becomes enchanted with the Italian way of living. Helen Mirrewn (The Queen) is equally good in her small role as the flighty Lilia. Judy Davis (Marie Antoinette , The Beak-up) provides the comic relief as a proper lady who cannot abide a half-English child being brought up by Italians.It all makes for a good movie with fine performances.</p>
