But Donald, the social worker and Vivian's lover who gave Joe his break is hot on their tail and wants Joe back in prison. Joe and Vivian must now prevent Donald from sending the children back to Philidelphia where they'll have no future.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Richard Pryor portrays con men so often yet he always manages to make it funny. The plot this time around involves con man Pryor being on the run and taking the time to escort a group of kids and their keeper (Cicely Tyson) cross country by means of a bus that he has to drive. The comic hilarity that can be exepcted from Pryor is evident here.</p>
