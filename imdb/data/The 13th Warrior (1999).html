<h1>The 13th Warrior (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sheikh ahmed ibn fadlan leads a group of savants from Baghdad according to the caliph's request to meet the demand of the Bulgarian's king, Almash Yaltwar, who asked to learn about the Islamic religion to find explanation for the most important question: how can this religion, which comes from the heart of the desert, create the biggest empire in the world?</p>
<p>In AD 922, Arab courtier Ahmad Ibn Fadlan accompanies a party of Vikings to the barbaric North. Ibn Fadlan is appalled by the Vikings customs-- their wanton sexuality, their disregard for cleanliness, their cold-blooded human sacrifices. And then he learns the horrifying truth: he has been enlisted to combat a terror that slaughters the Vikings and devours their flesh.</p>
<p>In AD 922, Arab Ahmad Ibn Fadlan is sent to the land of the Bulgar's as an emissary, because he fell in love with the wrong woman. During his journey, his caravan runs into a Vikings camp. They stay the night and the next day a young boy reaches the camp to call the warriors home: The Wendol, creatures of the Mist, have started attacking their homeland, killing and eating everyone in their way. The oracle forces a thirteenth warrior to accompany the Vikings, but this must not be a man from the north. Ahmad does not feel comfortable with the strange men of the north, at first, but when he finds out that the Wendol really exist, he bravely fights alongside the Vikings in an impossible battle against an enemy that can't be stopped.</p>
<p>A man, having fallen in love with the wrong woman, is sent by the sultan himself on a diplomatic mission to a distant land as an ambassador. Stopping at a Viking village port to restock on supplies, he finds himself unwittingly embroiled on a quest to banish a mysterious threat in a distant Viking land.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time.  I am not a big action film lover, and really did not want to see this, but it had me at the edge of my seat and enjoying it the whole time.  There is enough dry humor thrown in so it does not get to dark.  This movie will definitely be added to my DVD collection!</p>
