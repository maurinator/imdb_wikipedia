<h1>Munchie (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this in-name-only sequel to Munchies (1987), a new kid in town, Gage Dobson, can't find his place in the new environment despite having such a cool name. The kids at school bully him, the girl he likes doesn't register him and his mom is about to marry a scoundrel. Everything changes for Gage Dobson when he stumbles into Munchie, a friendly gremlin-like creature that dresses like a lounge singer, sounds like a stand-up comedian and has magic powers. They become friends and Munchie decides to help the kid with all these problems. Gage Dobson is about to get even! If only there wasn't a mad scientist who wants to use Munchie for experiments to learn how the creature ticks.</p>
<p>The ever hungry and funny Munchie is back in this sequel to "Munchies".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Munchie is not a sequel to Munchies as the cover box will try to make you believe.  I don't remember a thing about this horrible movie since I saw it so long ago, but the critter in question is nothing like the critters in Munchies.  I hate people that make sequels that aren't actually sequels, i.e. Troll 2, Halloween III, and this schlock of a movie.  SEE MUNCHIES!  DON'T SEE THIS!!!</p>
