<h1>Which Way to the Front? (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brendan Byers III, one of the richest men in America, has been pronounced 4-F and can't serve his country in it's fight against Hitler. However, Byers is not the kind of man who takes "No" for an answer and so a recruits other 4-F's to fight against the Axis powers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this movie is the most misunderstood film in Jerry Lewis career. It's little slow starting, but after it gets going is very funny & Jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier films..., ie, Who's Minding the Store, The Nutty Professor, etc., the idea, is clear, it's a mock of the Dirty Dozen, instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film, you have 4, 4-f's & 2 tag alongs. Including the Former L.A. Dodgers all-star Centerfielder, Willie Davis as Linc! HILARIOUS! Love that Movie!</p>
