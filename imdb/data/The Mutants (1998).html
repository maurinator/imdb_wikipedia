<h1>The Mutants (1998)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kids. Kids rejected. Kids who don't understand a society that don't understands them either. Kids not loved who are sometimes full of love to give that nobody wants. Kids with no family or with such families that it would be better to have none at all. Kids interned in institutions they hate and which don't do anything useful for them. Escaping kids and kids chased. Freedom. That's all this is about. Kids looking for the freedom due to any human being. This movie shows it rather well in a sequence of images sometimes tough sometimes moving. The little actors play their roles very well and convincingly. It's not a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway.</p>
