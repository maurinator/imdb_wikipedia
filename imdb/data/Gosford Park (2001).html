<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in the 1930s, the story takes place in an old-fashioned English country house where a weekend shooting party is underway. The story centers on the McCordle family, particularly the man of the house, William McCordle. Getting on in years, William has become benefactor to many of his relatives and friends. As the weekend goes on, secrets are revealed, and it seems everyone, above stairs and below, wants a piece of William and his money, but how far will they go to get it?</p>
<p>Robert Altman, one of America's most distinctive filmmakers, journeys to England for the first time to create a unique film mosaic with an outstanding ensemble cast. Set in the 1930's, "Gosford Park" brings a group of pretentious rich and famous together for a weekend of relaxation at a hunting resort. But when a murder occurs, each one of these interesting characters becomes a suspect.</p>
<p>Sir William McCordle is a wealthy but uncouth industrialist-turned-aristocrat, with a large house in the English countryside, complete with staff. It is a world where everything runs in order - both upstairs, where Sir William and his much younger wife Lady Sylvia indulge in a very comfortable existence of shooting, dinners and parties, and downstairs, where the servants work endlessly under the command of the butler Mr. Jennings, and the house keeper Mrs. Wilson. Whether they like it or not, everyone knows their place. But a shooting party will change all of that, with friends of the McCordles and their servants arriving from outside to upset the order. And so begins a complicated tale of secrets, lies, deceit, betrayal, revenge, bitterness, hatred, money and love - and that's all before the murder.</p>
<p>When William McCordle is found sitting at his desk with a knife in his chest, few people grieve. He and his wife Sylvia are hosting a weekend shooting party. There are a variety of guests including Sylvia sister and her husband, Lord and Lady Stockbridge; film star Ivor Novello and a Hollywood producer; an aunt who is dependent on McCordle for her allowance; and a variety of business associates all wanting something or other from the man. Downstairs at Gosford Park, there is a beehive of activity, but if truth be told, few among the servants will miss McCordle. Some of the women used to work for him in his factories and he was known to take advantage of his female employees. When the police announce that the victim died of poisoning and was only stabbed after he was dead, there is yet another mystery to solve. Beneath the surface, everyone in the house has secrets - but which would be a motive for murder?</p>
<p>The lives of upstairs guests and downstairs servants at a party in 1932 in a country house in England as they investigate a murder involving one of them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent movie about an "idea."  The murder mystery is itself a "MacGuffin" to the central question of some of the characters' inter-relationships.  This film is deserving of its Academy Award and nominations !!  Watch it twice since it bears more insights on a closer viewing; it is full of "inside" entertainment for those who love the films of that era and the pop music genre of the 1930's.  Truly an ensemble effort with some excellent work by hardworking veterans and young British geniuses.</p>
