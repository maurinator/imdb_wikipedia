<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sundance prizewinner. Fictionalized portrait of one of history's great literary couples: Stein & Toklas. Summer 1930s France, Alice tends to ailing Gertrude; they visit Fernande Olivier, Guillaume Apollinaire, others; and Hemingway pops in.</p>
<p>A few months in the life of Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein. During this 1930s summer, they fear Gertrude is seriously ill. While they await the results of medical tests, Alice attends to Gertrude in addition to giving assistance editing Gertrude's writing. They go driving in the French countryside (Gertrude drives, Alice navigates) and meet a young American on his way to fight in the Spanish Civil War. They visit Pablo Picasso and his muse, Fernande Olivier, and Guillaume Apollinaire. Ernest Hemingway pays a call. A friend brings a fatherless baby whom Alice agrees to care for. Through it all, Gertrude takes Alice for granted, treating her abruptly and unfeelingly. Hemingway complains on Alice's behalf. Can Gertrude bring herself to be tender?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We saw this on public television and thought that it was an excellent portrayal of the relationship between these two fascinating women. They lived openly as a couple in a time when it was a good deal more dangerous and unusual to do so than now.Linda Hunt as always is a riveting actress, and Alice B. Toklas may have been the more interesting member of the couple. I certainly wouldn't call Linda Bassett "starry-eyed" - she's as masculine, egotistical, and commanding a presence as she was described in real life. This production is fairly true to Gertrude's autobiography, which she published under Alice's name.</p>
