<h1>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Whos, an almost mutated sort of munchkinlike people. All the Whos love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch.</p>
<p>In this live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale by Dr. Seuss, the reclusive green Grinch decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville. Reluctantly joined by his hapless dog, Max, the Grinch comes down from his mountaintop home and sneaks into town to swipe everything holiday-related from the Whos. However, the bitter grump finds a hitch in his plans when he encounters the endearing Cindy Lou Who.</p>
<p>Rejected by the Whos as a child and living in spiteful seculsion for most of his life, the Grinch has always hated the citizens of Whoville. That especially goes for Christmas with the Whos noise, phony sentiment and wasteful materialism. When little Cindy Lou Who's attempt to transcend the festivities' empty commercialism by inviting the Grinch ends with his public humiliation, the Grinch hatches upon on his supreme scheme to ruin the holidays.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Whoville, there lives a green, revenge-seeking Grinch who plans on ruining the Christmas holiday for all of the citizens of the town.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes......This movie has really grown on me. I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. I saw the movies and owned the books as a kid and was given the books as a present in my 30's by my friend Amy Fidler. I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly, it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast/character depth and development. I have to admit, there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill. Bought it on the Playstation Network, can't wait to own it on Blu-ray. Narrater rocked it too.</p>
