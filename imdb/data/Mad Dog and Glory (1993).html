<h1>Mad Dog and Glory (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Wayne Dobie is a shy police photographer who saves the life of crime boss Frank Milo. Greatful, Milo insists on being Wayne's friend, offering him the companionship of "Glory", one of his employees. Wayne is thus in a difficult situation: he can't be seen to be fraternising with criminals, and he's unsure about how to deal with Glory.</p>
<p>Wayne Dobie is a good police photographer but not very confident with his other duties. Even so he manages to get local racketeer Frank Milo out of a hold up with his life, for which Milo wants to thank him. He does this by sending Glory round for a week, giving Dobie something of a problem. Milo seems to own people and he has a hold over Glory so that if she returns early it will go badly with her. And she's damned attractive too.</p>
<p>After his life is saved by a lonely cop, a mobster who moonlights as a stand-up comedian provides the cop with a beautiful young companion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First time I watched this film I was so perplexed by it that I had to watch it again, and on the second viewing I loved it.  What had initially confused me about the film was the packaging that suggested a typical Hollywood romantic comedy.  That's not what it is at all.  What it IS, is a fascinating character driven drama with some very funny moments.  It also features some of the best work of the three leads respective careers.This is one of De Niro's best performances ever and definitely his most underrated.  He has too often slipped into the thug for hire role (The Untouchables, Cape Fear, The Fan) but here he creates an extraordinarily well-rounded character that you can completely understand.  He says more about Wayne with his facial expressions, the way he holds himself, and his pattern of speech then any of the dialogue in the movie.Thurman matches him all the way.  She perfectly captures Glory.  There's really not much more you can say about her performance than that, it is faultless.  She never reveals Glory's true intentions AT ALL during the film, make your own mind up.  Does she really want to be with Wayne or is she just using him to get away from Frank Milo.  Even right at the end, there's a hint that she is still just 'doing Wayne a favour'.Bill Murray is the big surprise.  He effectively balances the menace and humour of Milo.  You feel his frustration in the life he leads , by the way he looks at his henchmen, the way he tries to befriend Wayne.  It is a strong yet subtle performance and Murray proves he is far more than just a funny man.David Caruso and Mike Starr are also excellent in their respective supporting roles.Scenes to watch out for are a touching "bad sex" scene.  How often do we see this, usually sex in the movies is either terrific for those involved or played for laughs but Mad Dog and Glory dares to be realistic.  Also watch for Wayne singing along to the dukebox and the scene when Wayne refuses to give back Glory to Milo.The film is always intellingent and never sinks to gimmicky resolutions. It's slow and low-key which may turn some people off.  But if you like character driven movies then you'll love this.  This film seems to get better every time I watch it.  It's truly one of the hidden gems of 1993.9/10</p>
