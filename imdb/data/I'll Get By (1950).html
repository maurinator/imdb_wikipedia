<h1>I'll Get By (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Updated version of "Tin Pan Alley" concerns two songwriters and their romantic entanglements with the pretty pair of sisters helping them plug their songs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Musicals about songwriters were de rigeur in the 50's, and this one fits in the center of the mold.  But, it's fun, light, bouncy, easy to take, and Steve Allen has a lot of fun as a disc jockey, and Dennis Day and Gloria De Haven are marvelous in their scene together.  A good film to watch when you need an unpretentious escape.</p>
