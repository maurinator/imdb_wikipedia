<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A neo-Nazi doctor tries to make a superwoman of his daughter who has been specially fed, exercised, and conditioned since she was a child to run in the Olympics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The idea behind "Goldengirl" - a female athlete competing in the Olympics who has been receiving unorthodox training and treatment for years - is an intriguing one. It should have played out a lot better than it does here. The main problem with the movie is that for the most part it's surprisingly boring. There should have been a lot more intrigue and suspense showing this heavily conditioned woman fighting for Olympic gold. This lack of bite might explain why the cast give lethargic performances. There's no heat between James Coburn and Susan Anton, not just because Coburn is old enough to be Anton's father. And while the movie was made for theaters, except for some fleeting nudity and the occasional raw word, the production feels like it was made for television instead. It's no wonder why this movie has been pretty much forgotten.</p>
