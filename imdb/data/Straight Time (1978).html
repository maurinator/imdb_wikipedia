<h1>Straight Time (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After being released on parole, a burglar attempts to go straight, get a regular job, and just go by the rules. He soon finds himself back in jail at the hands of a power-hungry parole officer. When he is released again, he assaults the parole officer, steals his car, and returns to a life of crime.</p>
<p>After many juvenile detentions and six years in prison, the small time thief and burglar Max Dembo is released on parole. Max has an initial friction with his nasty parole officer Earl Frank, but the officer agrees to let him live in a hotel room if he gets a job within a week. Max goes to an employment agency and the attendant Jenny Mercer helps him to get a job in a can industry. Max is decided to begin a new life straight and visits his old pal Willy Darin and his family. When Willy brings Max home, he injects heroin and leaves his spoon under Max's bed. Max dates Jenny and on the next day after hours, he finds Frank waiting for him snooping around his room. Frank finds the spoon and sends Max to prison for tests to prove whether he had a fix or not. Despite the negative result, Frank leaves Max for a week imprisoned. When Max is released again, Franks gives a ride and presses him to tell who had a fix in his room. Max hits Frank, steals his car and seeks out his former friends to restart his life of crime. Jenny lodges Max at her place and has a love affair with him. Max and his best friend Jerry Schue successfully rob a bank; but after a jewelry heist in Beverly Hills, where Max loses Jerry and Willy, he leaves California and Jenny and heads alone elsewhere.</p>
<p>After six years in prison for armed robbery, Max Dembo, a career robber who has offenses dating back to age twelve, is released on parole. Max, who wants to go straight, doesn't much like the restrictions of parole and does whatever he can to push the boundaries of that parole, much to the chagrin of his parole officer, Earl Frank, who tries to be somewhat flexible, but which may be increasingly difficult as Max pushes harder and harder. Some of those conditions include living in a half way house, not associating with past friends and associates, no driving, and no drugs. Living a straight life may be more difficult than he imagines especially as his encounters with Earl become increasingly black and white, at least in Earl's mind. The way Max deals with Earl is the same way he deals with everything in life: his way or the high way. Through his life in the outside world, Max embarks on a relationship with Jenny Mercer, an employment agency clerk who he meets while looking for a job. Jenny knows about his past criminal history, but he ends up only telling her so much of his current life if only to protect her... just in case.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is such a great film. The cast is so excellent. You've got Dustin Hoffman, who turns in one of his best performances, but it only gets better from there. Gary Busey plays Hoffman's buddy and husband to Kathy Bates-both excellent. Harry Dean Stanton (probably one of my favorite actors) plays one of Hoffman's partners in heist. His performance is right on the money as always. M. Emmet Walsh plays Hoffman's nearly inhumanly sleazy parole officer. Walsh does such a good job here too(I read somewhere that the Coens saw him in this movie and that was what led them to cast him in Blood Simple). Theresa Russell does a nice job as Hoffman's girlfriend. Eddie Bunker himself shows up as a bartender. It's no one wonder Tarantino would want to study this film-it's remarkable.</p>
