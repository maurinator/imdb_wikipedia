<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bet you didn't know that Kirk Douglas took the director's chair a couple of times, POSSE being one of them. If you like westerns, like me, you'll probably find this decent. The movie does suffer from the middle third of the movie, where the story pretty much grinds to a halt. Though this part wasn't really boring, it will probably make you wish they would get on with it. Also, the actions taken by certain characters near the end, though having some justification, didn't seem to have enough justification.On the positive side, POSSE is well shot, well acted, good production values, and an interesting ending. It's worth seeing.P.S. - Leonard Maltin's description of this movie isn't exactly how the movie plays.</p>
