<h1>September Affair (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An industrialist (Joseph Cotton) and a pianist (Joan Fontaine) meet on a trip and fall in love. Through a quirk of fate, they are reported dead in a crash though they weren't on the plane. This gives them the opportunity to live together free from their previous lives. Unfortunately, this artificial arrangement leads to greater and greater stress. Eventually the situation collapses when they come to pursue their original, individual interests without choosing a common path.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've been a Joan fan for a while now, so when I saw the laser disc for this movie I got it right away. I was definitely not disappointed.This movie has got a great story that could actually happen in real life. Joan gives a great performance as usual, of course Joseph is also perfect as the man she falls in love with at the same time saving her life. A great movie to watch if you like romance and a beautiful setting for a movie Italy.</p>
