<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Man o man.  This movie is great.  As a history student its awesome to look back on these types of things and see what the buzz was around the time of the movie's release.  The plot is insane, acting over-the-top, but the historical commentary is amazing.  People actually believed that such a thing as this was possible in the mid-80s, pre-Gorbachev.  This is not "low-level propaganda," its the most obvious pro-American movie I have EVER seen.On the movie alone, the "film" shouldn't even rate.  But as a Cold-War barometer, every interested person should see this to peer into the height of US-Soviet tensions.</p>
