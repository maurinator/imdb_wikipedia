<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I find The Train Robbers to be a surprisingly under-appreciated western. The more times I see it, the more I appreciate it myself. Sure, the feel and the look may be old-fashioned for its time but I don't care. Kennedy, Wayne and the rest of the group have obviously settled to make a fine basic western romp, not a new-styled masterpiece, and have reached the goal with very satisfying results. There can be seen a few little touches of Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (the first scene of Ben Johnson waiting at the train station), Siegel's 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' (a sister Sara-type treatment of the female character) or Hill's 'Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid' (the pursuing gang of riders). It also brings to mind Peckinpah's 'Ride the High Country'. But after these slight touches it's always back to the good old' Wayne stuff and I have nothing to complain about that.With the music underlining heavily the handsome photography makes some highly iconic and beautiful pictures. There are frames that look a lot like classic western paintings. The nature and the people are seen beautifully during the long ride through deserts, rivers and storms. Sometimes it almost feels like watching 'Easy Rider' of the Wayne generation on horses. "Let's go to Mexico."The action works fine like it always does when these old times film pros have been on the job. The men might be saddle-weary, but still gutsy enough and well worn like good saddle leather. You can tell the experience and good times as well from their voices. There is also a lot of warmth shining out of them, specially from Wayne's side. Ann-Margret has no real competition being the only woman in the picture. Besides "sticking out from the right places" she holds up pretty well especially with Wayne, who easily blew other actors aside with his strong presence on the screen.With appropriately ironic note to its end the whole raid for the lost gold serves as a very good early seventies western and a decent one in Wayne's canon.</p>
