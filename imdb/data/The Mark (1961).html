<h1>The Mark (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is the story of a 33 year old man, Jim Fuller, released from prison after serving a three year term for intent to commit child molestation. Fuller is assisted by the prison psychiatrist in obtaining a position. He does well in this position and falls in love with the secretary of the owner of the company. A child is molested and beaten in the town where he now lives and the police pick him up for questioning. He has an alibi and is released, but a reporter who covered his former trial recognizes him. The reporter begins to follow him and reports that Fuller spent time alone with the daughter of his girl friend.</p>
<p>Changing his name from Jim Fontaine, Jim Fuller is starting life anew in a British town where's he's never lived. He has just been placed on parole after serving time in prison for kidnapping nine year old Patricia Elmsworth with the intent of molesting her. He let her go before he caused her any physical harm. He did not put up a defense at his trial, knowing that he was sick and needed the help of a mental health professional in prison to deal with whatever was making him behave as he had. His parole is largely on the testimony of the prison doctor, Edmund McNally, whose diagnosis is that he is well enough to resume life outside of prison. McNally, who has returned to private practice, serves as Jim's parole officer. With help from McNally, Jim is able to secure a job in his field of accounting at Clive Enterprises. The only people at Clive Enterprises who know Jim was in prison are Andrew Clive, the company owner who knows the entire story, and Clive's secretary, Ruth Leighton, who only knows about prison but not the reason. As Jim tries to adjust to life on the outside, he uses McNally as his sounding board while always second guessing his own motivations. He knows the root causes of his deviant behavior, which also manifested themselves in him never having had a meaningful sexual or romantic relationship with a woman. Thus he treads lightly when he embarks on a relationship with Ruth, who does not want to know the reason for his incarceration as they just start to date, believing it would only muddy the waters. But that relationship is tested when Jim learns of and eventually meets Ruth's adolescent daughter, Janie. Jim may face further obstacles in his new life if he were ever to meet anyone who knew or knew of Jim Fontaine.</p>
<p>A man who served prison time for intent to molest a child tries to build a new life with the help of a sympathetic psychiatrist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Mark, daring for its time in handling the matter of recovering sex offenders, is rather tame stuff for today. It's also something that the cops on Special Victims Unit wouldn't buy in a million years.Mainly because the rate of recidivism among them is very high. Rod Steiger as psychiatrist claims he's 'cured' Stuart Whitman of any lingering desires for pubescent young females, but Detectives Benson and Stabler would never buy it.The film is a British production with three imported stars. Stuart Whitman is an American who settled in London and did serve a stretch in prison for unlawful imprisonment of a minor. Rod Steiger tried out the brogue he was to use 14 years later in Hennessy as the psychiatrist who works with sex offenders. And Maria Schell from Austria plays a young widow with a child who develops a relationship with Whitman.Whitman's been placed in a job with Donald Wolfit's firm and he knows about Whitman and why he was in jail. Brenda DaBanzie and Maurice Denham rent Whitman a room and start treating him like surrogate parents. Things really start going well for Whitman, but when he's picked up for questioning in a child sex murder, reporter Donald Houston recognizes him and writes a story. A lot of people then reevaluate their relationship with Whitman.As for what happens you'll have to see the film for it. It's a well acted drama, Stuart Whitman got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, but lost to Maximilian Schell, Maria's brother ironically enough for Judgment at Nuremberg. Still it could never be made today, because the audience simply wouldn't buy it.</p>
