<h1>Blueprint (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the first cloned human being - told in her own words: At the age of thirty the world-famous composer Iris Sellin learns that she has an incurable illness. She - a person who wanted to live for ever - does however not give in. In order to preserve her art and also herself, beyond death, for all posterity, she has herself cloned. Her daughter Siri, whom, in this way, she turns into her virtual twin, learns as a child that she is the world's first cloned human being. In fact a blueprint: a blueprint of her mother. From that moment on nothing is as it was before...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The subject certainly is interesting, the plot has a solid pace.  It's not all that often you see an actor/actress play the piano herself, on screen (save for the close-up in real difficult pieces), and come across as actually believable.  Franka Potente does, and for both that and the plot I'd have like to give this one a vote of 8.  But...Unfortunately, the make-up department and the special effects crew committed some major crimes of negligence. First, the hair-do of supporting actress Katja Studt playing her role at an advanced age are almost _unbelievably_ bad.  It really looks as if someone just jumped into a wig shop on their way to some other, more important business, and took the first one they saw without ever even thinking about how it'd look on a freckled redhead like her.  I've seen carnival wigs look more believable than that one.The other major downfall is an overwhelmingly obvious wax puppet of Franka Potente in a scene where both of her personae are on screen at the same time.  I found it looked un-natural enough that it managed to drop the whole scene dead in its tracks.  Couldn't help but stare at that puppet instead of paying attention to the movie itself.Let-downs like that invoke the feeling you're watching a massively under-financed B-movie or student production.  If you're a fan of Franka Potente and can tolerate some bad craft work, you'll quite probably like this movie a lot.  I didn't.</p>
