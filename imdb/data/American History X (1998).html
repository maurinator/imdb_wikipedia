<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Derek Vineyard is paroled after serving 3 years in prison for killing two thugs who tried to break into/steal his truck. Through his brother, Danny Vineyard's narration, we learn that before going to prison, Derek was a skinhead and the leader of a violent white supremacist gang that committed acts of racial crime throughout L.A. and his actions greatly influenced Danny. Reformed and fresh out of prison, Derek severs contact with the gang and becomes determined to keep Danny from going down the same violent path as he did.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this  film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black &  white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and  shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic,  ironically by a British director.The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the  younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after  killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature &  brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist  sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are  embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek  becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by  youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo  Nazi propaganda. The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a  steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually  embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very  apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the  prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own  demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by  his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be  that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the  Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with  his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being  influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change  his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right  side of humanity.I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to  change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want  is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants  the same for his brother. Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds  tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by  mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and  intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by  the same man (Derek / Norton).Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which  provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on  every high school curriculum</p>
