<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the first Beethoven, while it had its flaws, it was cute and charming. This sequel has its contrivances and a little mediocre in places, but it is a decent sequel, definitely one of the more watchable ones in the franchise. The script is weak in places, and the plot is something you will have seen before. Plus the pacing is rather hectic, and the film could have been longer. That said it is beautifully filmed, with lovely cinematography and even better scenery. The music score I couldn't fault either, and the gags are interesting(the hamburger contest was a riot). The acting is decent, with Charles Grodin very entertaining as George and Bonnie Hunt luminous as Alice. As the villains of the pieces, Debi Mazar and Chris Penn also impress. But the real stars are the dogs, Beethoven is still his funny and adorable self, but he is almost upstaged by the beautiful and equally adorable Missy. Overall, has its problems, but as a sequel it is watchable, certainly better than the rating here(and I also think the first film is rated too low). 6/10 Bethany Cox</p>
