<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my greatest films of alltime, the film has an eerie, grey feel about it. Amitabh who went on to amazing status really shines and portrays the character who is (based on Haji Mastan a notorious mumbai outlaw)isolated from society and family magnificantly, the role won him best actor 1975. A film richly layered in metaphor and meaning, with deeply powerful dialogues and symbolic significance. The camera work however makes the film look very dated which may put people off watching an old film, but if your not judging a book by the cover, based on sheer performances and script well worth a watch.</p>
