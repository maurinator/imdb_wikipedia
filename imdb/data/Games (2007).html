<h1>Games (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cuddy tells House she finally wants to know who he picks as a member of his team and he decides that whoever finds out what's wrong with a seedy, drug using rock musician gets the job. Foreman doesn't like the fact House plays this game with the life of the rocker. Meanwhile, Wilson has made a wrong diagnosis: He told a man he's going to die while, in fact, the man is as fit as a fiddle.</p>
<p>House treats a rock musician, and some of the candidates have to get past their personal biases, Wilson misdiagnoses a patient, and the winners are named.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent episode both for the patient and the winnowing down of the new team to the final three. A grunge rocker (Jeremy Renner of ROAD TRIP) begins coughing up blood. Problem is, he is a heroin addict and drunkard who doesn't care if he lives or dies. House challenges the remainder of the candidates to solve this guy's problem or face expulsion. Predictably, they all try a little too hard. It is particularly interesting to watch the hard-driving Amber trying to relate to the nihilistic rocker, who harbors a very special secret. House has interesting set-tos with both Cuddy and Wilson, for very different reasons. Or are they? Whom he fires at the conclusion is a major shocker. But is he for real? Great stuff.</p>
