<h1>Fire Down Below (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tony and Felix own a tramp boat, and sail around the Caribbean doing odd jobs and drinking a lot. They agree to ferry the beautiful but passportless Irena to another island. They both fall for her, leading to betrayal and a break-up of their partnership. Tony takes a job on a cargo ship. After a collision he finds himself trapped below deck with time running out (the ship is aflame), and only Felix, whom he hates and has sworn to kill, left to save him.</p>
<p>Tony and Felix own a boat and transport goods, mostly legal, to various islands in the Caribbean. Their latest job is to carry a beautiful redhead, Irena, to Trinidad with no questions asked. She from Eastern Europe and has no documents. After World War II she went to the US with an American soldier and is now on her own. Felix sees her for what she is but Tony falls for her pretty hard. When she rejects him, Tony goes to work on a merchant ship that's now heading back to Trinidad and he has every intention of getting even. The ship is involved in a collision in the fog and Tony is trapped in the hold. When the ship's cargo of rubber catches fire, it's a race against time to get him out before the ship explodes. The local port doctor says they may have to amputate his legs to set him free but he flatly refuses. The doctor turns to Felix and Irina for help.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rita Hayworth was 40 at the time this film was made. Rather interesting. She still looked lovely. Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon are both vying for her attention; Mitchum wins out momentarily.Toward the end the story shifts as Lemmon is trapped in a ship, there is a fire, and Lemmon becomes a more sympathetic character. Mitchum and Hayworth feel guilty. This story would seem ripe for a re-make; it is a good story; rather a curiosity.The Technicolor oranges and greens are prevalent; it is always interesting to watch films from this period. It would seem the stars themselves were fabricated to coordinate with the surroundings. The scenes at the carnival event are colorful and wild. Worth seeing as a commentary on the times.</p>
