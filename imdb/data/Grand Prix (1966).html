<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The best motorsports film made. Frankenheimer received cooperation from all the F1 teams in filming this movie, allowing it to avoid the cheesy typical Hollywood race movie(Days of Thunder, Driven). His desire to display the sport as it really is, made this movie spectacular. The race footage was way ahead of it's time, and still creates a thrill in me whenever I watch it.</p>
