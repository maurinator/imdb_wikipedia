<h1>Hercules Returns (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Brad quits his job at a large cinema chain, to open his own picture theatre, his ex-boss sabotages the opening night by switching the Italian film with a non-subtitled version. Brad and his team hilariously improvise the dialogue to avert disaster.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ever since I first saw this film in 1995 I have made it one of my all time favorites. The smutty filthy humour, the 'f****n prawns' and Delilah had me in tears, true belly laughs are to be had watching this movie.This movie is very entertaining, hilarious and full of memorable one liners that you can drive your friends crazy with! A very funny movie!</p>
