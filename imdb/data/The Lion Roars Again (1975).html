<p>This short film is a chronicle of the 1975 International Press Conclave hosted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer over two days in May 1975. The event was used to preview several upcoming MGM feature films. After opening remarks by studio vice-president 'Daniel Melnick', the press gets a tour of a set that will be used in the film Logan's Run (1976), plus a short fashion show of the film's futuristic costumes. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire host a luncheon honoring That's Entertainment, Part II (1976). Next is a press conference for a film with the working title "The All-American Girl" (the film was eventually released under the title Sweet Revenge (1976). The first day ends with a dinner for the stars of _Sunshine Boys, The (1975)_. 'Richard Benjamin', host of the dinner, is surprised by the presentation of a birthday cake. 'George Burns' and Walter Matthau also address the diners. The second day begins with a press conference for Hearts of the West (1975). This is followed by a special premiere of _Wind and the Lion, The (1975)_. The conclave concludes with a dinner and ball on a sound stage made to look like the Moroccan desert depicted in the film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm guessing this short M-G-M promotional film that I just watched on the HD DVD of That's Entertainment, Part II, was another one of those fillers (and an adequate one at that) meant to fill the rest of a two hour timeslot the Big Three networks had when showing theatrical movies that ran short on it. After then-vice president of production Dan Melnick speaks to the reporters assembled, we're shown first some sets of Logan's Run and then a fashion show of the futuristic costumes from that movie of which David Hasselhoff is one of the models. Next, there's a press conference for TEP2 where we see Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire mingle with various critics of which I swear Roger Ebert is one of them. You can hardly hear them. The next movie plugged is something called All American Girl which I found out here on IMDb would eventually be called Sweet Revenge. Anyway, its star Stockard Channing appears for a few brief scenes but is not interviewed. After that is a party for The Sunshine Boys of which Richard Benjamin is pleasantly surprised of having a giant cake brought up in his honor as it was his birthday that day. Walter Matthau talks about having a lot of fun and thinking it would flop because of that. Then, George Burns tells an amusing story of his show business experiences before doing a very amusing song. He's the highlight and at least the mics were clear on him as it wasn't when we next go to Hearts of the West and producer Tony Bill barely sounds above a whisper. The last film showcased was The Wind and the Lion and we only see a clip with Sean Connery and Candice Bergen the latter of which showed up at the studio with Melnick along with her parents. Speaking of Daniel, he said in the beginning speech that the lion never stopped roaring and yes, considering many good M-G-M movies that subsequently came since then that was true. But now the studio is up for sale again. And with the next James Bond flick and The Hobbit in limbo, one wonders about Leo's roar continuing...</p>
