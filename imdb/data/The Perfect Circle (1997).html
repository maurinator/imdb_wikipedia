<p>War torn Sarajevo and life turns into a game as you play dodge the bullets. Hamza, (Mustafa Nadarevic), is a poet with visions of his own death by hanging, a way to escape the misery that surrounds him. Until one night he stumbles upon two orphans who put a hold on his misery as he attempts to get them out of hell. War is ugly but those who suffer are the ones with a will for peace and harmony.</p>
