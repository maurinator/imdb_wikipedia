<h1>Continental Divide (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ernie Souchak (John Belushi), a tough Chicago reporter, gets a little too close to the Mob, and is assaulted by two crooked police officers sent by a crooked councilman, and ends up in the hospital.

Sparring partners at first, the pair eventually fall in love, but Souchak must return to Chicago when one of his sources is mysteriously killed.</p>
<p>A hard-nosed Chicago journalist has an unlikely love affair with an eagle researcher.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this movie.  No, it is not the deep heady stuff, nor it is a slapstick comedy.  It is a movie about two people living in different worlds that cross paths, fall in love, and so on.  For Belushi, this role is as much of a course change as it is for his character when he goes into the mountains.  This is as far from SNL, Animal House and The Blues Brothers and Being There is from the Pink Panther Movies and Dr. Strangelove for Peter Sellers.  Blair Brown's character (Nell Porter) is totally hot in that special, wholesome, outdoors way.  You can how a guy could fall for her.All in all, this is a fine movie to rent for a night of popcorn, or maybe trail mix munching, with the family.  Don't wrap yourself up too tight in trying to analyze every little nuance of the movie, like so many of the wannabe critics that inhabit these reviews.  Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.</p>
