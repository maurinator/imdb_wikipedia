<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A directionless young man, recently released from prison, tries to make a new start in life as a boxer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Please disregard reviews referring to this as the Tekken animation. I am not familiar with this movie, but it is impossible for it to be based on the video game of the same name. This movie was made in 1990, the animation much later. Also, the character names do not match up. Tekken means Iron Fist, so there is a chance this is just a movie that chances to use the same name. If I ever come across this movie I will gladly watch it and write a reveiw. In the meantime, if you are looking for a review of the video game based animation, please look under Tekken: The Movie.</p>
