<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am perhaps not the best person to review this one, as I have always been annoyed at films and documentaries glorifying criminals from the old west. Some of my irritation is because these folks were real jerks--not heroes. But my biggest problem with most of these programs is that these criminals were minor annoyances--not big-time crooks. So, as I sat and watched the show, I just didn't care anything about Butch and Sundance. They weren't important characters to our real history and they were bad...not Robin Hood wannabes!This being said, the show is well made and pretty much what you'd expect from any episode of "The American Experiences"--nice production values and the like. So, if you are dying to see a documentary on these folks, this one is probably the best. However, it isn't very interesting nor memorable and I had a much harder time focusing on this one.</p>
