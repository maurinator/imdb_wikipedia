<h1>Ben (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A lonely boy befriends Ben, the leader of a violent pack of killer rats.</p>
<p>A lonely boy named Danny Garrison befriends Ben, the rat leader of the swarm of trained/telepathic rats found in Willard. Ben becomes the boy's best friend, protecting him from bullying and keeping his spirits up in the face of a heart condition. However, things gradually take a downward turn as Ben's swarm becomes violent, resulting in several deaths. Eventually, the police destroy the rat colony with flame throwers, but Ben survives and makes his way back to Danny. The film closes with Danny, tending to the injured Ben, determined not to lose his friend.</p>
<p>Ben's transition to a demonic rat was as a result of his disturbed upbringing, where he witnessed his anusive alcoholic father (Roland) bludgeon to death his mother (Blodwin) with a recycling bin lid. Ben needed to find an outlet for his raging grief, and formed a alliance with like minded rodents, who he discovered he could control with his mind.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have pet rats and they are the most sweet and loving creatures. This movie portrayed the love that people can share with rats and it was truly a beautiful movie. Ben was beautiful and Lee was a little cutey too. The lyrics to Ben ring out beautiful and true. This is really a must see for anybody who loves rats or even those who love animals in general. Some people may view this as a horror movie, but it is really soooo much more. A remake of Williard is apparently in the works, so fingers crossed that these wonderful movies will be released on DVD.</p>
