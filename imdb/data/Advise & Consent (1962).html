<h1>Advise & Consent (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Robert Leffingwell is the president's candidate for Secretary of State. Prior to his approval, he must first go through a Senate investigation to determine if he's qualified. Leading the Senate committee is idealistic Senator Brig Anderson, who soon finds himself unprepared for the political dirt that's revealed, including Leffingwell's past affiliations with a Communist organization. When Leffingwell testifies about his political leanings, he proves his innocence. Later, however, Anderson learns that he lied under oath and even asks the president to withdraw Leffingwell for consideration, especially after the young senator begins receiving blackmail threats about a skeleton in his own closet.</p>
<p>When the President of the United States nominates Robert A. Leffingwell to the post of Secretary of State, it's left to the U.S. Senate to confirm that appointment. Leffingwell is eminently qualified for the post but is seen by many in both parties, especially Senator Seabright Cooley, as an appeaser and soft on Communism. The Senate Majority Leader, Bob Munson, appoints an up and coming young Senator, Brigham Anderson, to chair the sub-committee reviewing the nomination. The hearings soon becomes a communist witch hunt with Leffingwell denying any communist affiliations or leanings. When Anderson learns that Leffingham did in fact attend several meetings of a communist cell and lied to the committee, he refuses to support the nomination. That's when he starts to receive phone calls threatening to reveal a romantic tryst he once had in Hawaii unless he supports the Leffingham nomination.</p>
<p>The hot topic of debate within the United States Senate is the President's controversial appointment of Robert A. Leffingwell as Secretary of State, controversial even within the President's own party. The controversy stems not from Leffingwell's abilities, but rather his overly principled manner which has often gotten in the way of political expediency. As such, Leffingwell has in the past ruffled the feathers of some within the Senate, with some of those ruffled feathers being against the individual as opposed to his or her general ideals. Senior Senator Seab Cooley, a man fond of grandstanding to get his point across, in particular sees Leffingwell as a Communist sympathizer. But Leffingwell also has his staunch supporters, such as Senator Fred Van Ackermann who sees Leffingwell as the type of man needed to maintain peace in this era of the Cold War. Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson sees that getting enough votes to confirm the appointment may be a difficult task. He strikes a senate subcommittee dealing with Leffingwell's appointment and names junior Senator Brig Anderson as Chair, who Munson knows will follow his wishes in this matter. During the subcommittee hearing, serious allegations are leveled against Leffingwell by an outside source, albeit one orchestrated by Cooley and one with some perceived lack of legitimacy seeing as to the source himself. As the pro and anti Leffingwell factions strategize on how to deal with the allegations (some which include blackmailers digging up skeletons in one politician's closet), Leffingwell himself has to decide what to do in light of the truth and what may be best for his professional future and that of others involved.</p>
<p>Senate investigation into the President's newly nominated Secretary of State, gives light to a secret from the past, which may not only ruin the candidate, but the President's character as well.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Allen Drury's sprawling novel of Washington intrigue gets a bit over-condensed in Wendell Mayes' screenplay--the exposition comes fast and furious and unconvincing, and some important subplots in the book, such as the space race, are altogether missing. But what's left is pretty juicy and compelling, as Secretary of State nominee Henry Fonda (top-billed, but with surprisingly little screen time) sets off a destructive round of politicking that ends in death, destruction, and satisfying upholding of the Constitution. Preminger handles the gay subplot with as little subtlety as you'd expect, and while he was clearly trying to show some sympathy to an oppressed minority, he comes off as a square homophobe. Don Murray is oversold as an Ideal Husband and Father to artificially ratchet up the poignancy, and as his wife, Inga Swenson just cries and cries, and seems a shrew and a scold. But the dialog is sharp, even with all the overexposition, and the cast is wonderful: Peter Lawford as a Kennedy-esquire Rhode Island senator, Burgess Meredith as a weak witness, George Grizzard as a Roy Cohn-like meddler, Gene Tierney as Pamela Harriman more or less, Charles Laughton as a tasty-ham Southern senator, Lew Ayres as a Vice President with hidden strength, Franchot Tone as the horse-trading President, and Walter Pidgeon as the sort of Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid should aspire to be. Even such solid character actors as Paul Ford, Russ Brown, and Betty White turn up in tiny parts. The cinematography's clean and uncluttered, and while this congressional bunch is far more articulate and epigrammatic than our own, the theme of backstage double-dealing feels more relevant than ever. Very fast-moving, and dated as it is, it still packs a wallop.</p>
