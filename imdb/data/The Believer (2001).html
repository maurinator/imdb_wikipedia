<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, there's isn't a better movie about anti-semitism and youth as "American History X" but this movie came close. I was surprised to see young Gosling pull off and really out-perform himself in this role. Excellent writing with a fantastic group of young, talented actors. Definitely worth seeing.8/10</p>
