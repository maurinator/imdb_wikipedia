<h1>K-911 (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mike Dooley has been teamed up with Jerry Lee, a German Shepherd dog, for nearly ten years, but Jerry Lee isn't as young as he once was, and Dooley's superiors suggest that maybe it's time that Jerry Lee was retired from the force. But there is a stalker who wants Dooley dead. The stalker, disgruntled crime novelist Devon Lane, became obsessed with Dooley's wife after she rejected his book, and he blames Dooley for her death. When Jerry Lee can't keep up with chasing Devon during a shootout, Captain Byers teams Dooley and Jerry Lee with a younger K9 team -- aggressive female detective Welles and her dog Zeus, a young, strong Doberman Pincher. After Dooley futilely investigates a convict he once busted, the dogs get him back on track by sniffing out Devon's storage locker. The room reveals Devon's identity to Dooley, and one of Devon's manuscripts reveals that he intends to make Dooley suffer for his words. When Devon makes a bold move by invading the precinct and taking Welles hostage, it's Dooley and Jerry Lee to the rescue. But can Jerry Lee pull off this rescue?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are one of the people who finds "According to Jim" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. And might I add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to air crap like Jim Belushi's show year after year."K-911" is a big, steaming, brown, German shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. Look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.</p>
