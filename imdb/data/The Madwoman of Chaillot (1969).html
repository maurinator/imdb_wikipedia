<h1>The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Life is a Sunday in the park for Aurelia, a dotty Parisian countess. But sooner or later, Aurelia had to find out about the so-called sane world. Join her in a whimsical look at a topsy-turvy world...and at a handful of kooks crazy enough to care.</p>
<p>Nice, eccentric, idealistic and slightly mad Countess Aurelia, who believes that the good must prevail over evil, decides to stand up to corrupt powerful leaders of Paris in her own way, which grabs everyones attention.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A wonderful fable I happened to stumble across. The inimitable Katharine Hepburn as the title character conspires with other eccentrics to save Paris. Warm, funny, delightfully non-sequitur and deeply poignant, this film has messages about love, greed, happiness, fear, hope, dreams. . .life. Excellent performances by all, including some wonderful dramatic acting by Danny Kaye. I highly recommend this movie.</p>
