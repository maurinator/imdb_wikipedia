<h1>Man of a Thousand Faces (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Loose biography of actor Lon Chaney. Growing up with deaf parents, he learns what it is like to be different. As an actor, he puts that knowledge (together with lots of make-up and talent) to use playing a variety of strange, unusual characters, adopting their characteristics so thoroughly as to be called the Man of a Thousand Faces.</p>
<p>Lon Chaney is a talented mime in the Teens working in vaudeville. He is married to the neurotic and unreliable Cleva Creighton, a singer whose erratic behavior costs both of them their jobs. When they go back to visit Chaney's family, Cleva is shocked to discover that his parents are deaf mutes. The paranoid, pregnant Cleva then irrationally presumes that her son by Lon may be born afflicted too. Even after their son is born healthy, she loses interest in being a wife and mother and tries to pursue a show business career alone. When Lon insists she return to mother young Creighton, she abandons them. When a judge decides Lon's stage career makes him an unfit parent, the actor moves to Hollywood in order to get regular, reliable employment, so he can regain custody.</p>
<p>The life and career of vaudevillian and silent screen horror star Lon Chaney, his contentious relationship with his neurotic wife, and his premature death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Other reviewers have knocked the film because it is not historically accurate and I can't dispute that. But for me, James Cagney's performance makes this a film that is a must-see. True, the film is short on depicting Lon Chaney's film characters and although we do get to see Cagney in makeup as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera, the scenes are extremely brief. Most of the film depicts Chaney's conflict with his first wife, wonderfully played by the stunning Dorothy Malone - whew, what a knockout!- and the stormy relationship with his son.The film is a soap opera but Cagney is wonderful showing that he can play drama, comedy and even dance and mime.</p>
