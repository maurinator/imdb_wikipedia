<h1>State of Siege (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Uruguay in the early 1970s, an official of the US Agency for International Development (a group used as a front for training foreign police in counterinsurgency methods) is kidnapped by a group of urban guerillas. Using his interrogation as a backdrop, the film explores the often brutal consequences of the struggle between Uruguay's government and the leftist Tupamaro guerillas.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"State of Siege" is a terrific movie with the same look and feel as Costa-Gavras's other classic of the period, "Z."  Set in Uruguay, "State of Siege" was actually filmed in Chile during the Allende presidency, and was ironically released shortly before the coup that overthrow Allende (the subject, of course, of "Missing," another Costa-Gavras film)."Z" was released on DVD last year in a newly restored version with excellent additional materials (modern interviews of Costa Gavras and Jorge Semprun, who wrote the screenplay, as well as interviews with the actors).  My question is, when will "State of Siege" receive the same treatment?  It is not available for sale in the US in any form, and is almost impossible to find as a rental.  Now that "Z" is available in such an excellent edition, its about time "State of Siege" was too.</p>
