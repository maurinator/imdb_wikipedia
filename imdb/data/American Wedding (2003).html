<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously.  Not a minute was wasted.  Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going.  Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence.  Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The plots were simple but believable.. How complex can a wedding story be anyways.  It made sense, it was funny, it was definately funnier than the second american pie movie.. im not going to say it was funnier than the first but I definately laughed longer and harder in this one.  Well done. Plus Alyson Hannigan is somehow getting hotter as the movies progress.</p>
