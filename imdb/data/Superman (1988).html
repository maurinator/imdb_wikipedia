<h1>Superman (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This series, the first since the character's overhaul revision in the comics by John Byrne, shows the adventures of the Man of Steel as he fights villains like the evil head of the mega-corporation Lexcorp, Lex Luthor. In addition, we see the adventures of Clark as a boy in Smallville and all the mischief he causes with his powers.</p>
<p>The Man of Steel fights evil in the city of Metropolis and beyond</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nobody really remembers this animated Superman series because it only lasted for about 2 months.  It was a twenty minute episode followed by a five minute "Smallville Journal" that told something about Superman's youth. This was the only time any series has even remotely attempted to remain close to the comic book.</p>
