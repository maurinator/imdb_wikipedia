<h1>Mother (1996)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A decent remake of Mars Ravelo's Wanted Perfect Mother, starring Regine Velasquez (Sam), hired initially as a music teacher but later became a private tutor of Dante's (Christopher de Leon) 4 kids, after his wife died. The difficulties of raising children and how Sam was able to win the children's hearts are well executed in Ike Jarlego's movie. Although there are some corny moments, Regine's bursting into songs, Bing Loyzaga's villainess role and the believable dialogues are plus factors in this comedy drama movie. Regine was able to portray the joy of taking care of the kids and her songs are well paced and easy to sing with. The love story that is blooming between the two leads feel a little shorthand, I am not convinced he really loves Sam and I suspect he just needs someone to take care of the kids; also Bing Loyzaga's talk with Christopher de Leon towards the end is a little unrealistic.Thank you to the writers that there are no car accidents in this movie that will resolve the issues of the characters. The ending is also a little too convenient, not too creative.</p>
