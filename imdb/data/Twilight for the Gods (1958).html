<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Twilight for the Gods coul have been a good tittle for a good movie. But is just stay in a good -and incomprehensible- tittle. By another side I sorry confess I did not read author this best seller at all. May be the novel where was based the film was a excellent book but in my opinion the film is a bite long for usual spectators. May be the old sailing ship was too old and the Captain too alcoholic. Any way there are a handful of masochistic traveller gathered round this Captain who insist in travel in spite of the poor appearance. The apathetic and long hear Captain David Bell is Rock Hudson. Miss Charlotte King (an elegant, curved and glorious Cyd Charisse) is quite all right but the rest of the passage is not very interesting to do a trip by the sea with them. That is why the navigation results some long. I personally thank indeed Miss King presence with her cloudy past. The little dog is funny too. Even it likes Cyd Charisse. It means it was a really clever dog. I give 6 (but only for Cyd Charisse).</p>
