<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Betaab is the story of Sunny (Sunny Deol) who lives a middle class life with his mother Sumintra. They make a living with there poultry farm. However, he met a girl called Roma/Dinky (Amrita Singh) who was his childhood companion and thought she was the same way. However, they met, fight & fell in love with each other. But her father Dinesh did not want Roma to marry Sunny since he had forgotten all about Sunny's family since sunny's father is no more alive. But Sunny's and Roma's love is so strong that no family ties could broke a bond that make between the two. This is actually one of the best films I have ever seen. I must say the Director must have take his time in putting this story together.</p>
