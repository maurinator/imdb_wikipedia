<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i watched the movie last night at a local film society in my own country.as a member of this society, i was a little bit confused about the movie if it might be full of nudity without any strong story line and acting,i thought it might be any B grade movie.so before watching this film, i collected several informations about this film from IMDb.com.and yeah, i was right. it not that type of movie that i thought.it is different like one of my favorite movie "Boogie Nights".the story line of this movie is about a porn star named "moon"(Juliette marques).from her own point of view, we enter the inner side of porn industry, her relations with so-called modern society, her own father, friends and her values.the script, music, direction and acting are brilliant.especially i want to mention the character "moon" in which plays a brilliant new comer actress Juliette marques. welcome her to the world cinema.her looking, ways of facial expressions and acting are very normal that could be very plus point for her acting career. and i like James woods also for playing the character "pops".finally, i also want to give thanks to director ash for making such a brilliant adult drama.i would like to rate this movie: 8 out of 10.</p>
