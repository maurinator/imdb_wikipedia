<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Honestly, I never cared for the movies produced by the modern Disney channel (I think they're calling it Zoog? Whatever that means.). In fact, I haven't really liked most of the more recent theatrical films from the Disney company. They seem to have gone way downhill since Walt died, though there have been signs that they are returning to form lately. Movies like Sky High, Pirates, and even The Game Plan was a minor improvement over the countless number of sub-par attempts they have been making since the late 80's. And now we have this. Yet another family sports comedy featuring a kid as the lead, just another sandlot wannabe. Or is it? Yes, the plot is cliché and tired, and yes, the film itself is endlessly predictable--especially how it ends. But somehow it manages to pull itself away from what seemed like inevitable mediocrity. The film itself had a sort of charm to it that really added to the viewer's enjoyment of what would be an otherwise pointless mess of cliché. That and Taylor Ball, best known for playing the part of Brian on the sitcom Still Standing. He times his lines just well enough that he actually makes some rather silly lines of dialog work. He manages to make a character out of one of the most tired cliché vehicles in the book. and for that, I praise him. Taylor Ball saved this movie from being a total failure. It is a wonder why he doesn't get more work.-Ryan out.</p>
