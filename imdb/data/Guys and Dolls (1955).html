<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>All the hot gamblers are in town, and they're all depending on Nathan Detroit to set up this week's incarnation of "The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York"; the only problem is, he needs $1000 to get the place. Throw in Sarah Brown, who's short on sinners at the mission she runs; Sky Masterson, who accepts Nathan's $1000 bet that he can't get Sarah Brown to go with him to Havana; Miss Adelaide, who wants Nathan to marry her; Police Lieutenant Brannigan, who always seems to appear at the wrong time; and the music/lyrics of Frank Loesser, and you've got quite a musical. Includes the songs: Fugue for Tinhorns, "Luck Be a Lady", "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat".</p>
<p>In New York, the smalltime gambler Nathan Detroit has been eloping from getting married with his girlfriend Adelaide for fourteen years. Nathan needs one thousand dollars in advance to rent a place for the crap game but neither he nor his friends Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet can afford. Nathan decides to bet against the gambler Sky Masterson, challenging him to have a dinner in Havana with a woman of his choice. Sky accepts the bet and Nathan chooses the prude Sergeant Sarah Brown, who runs a mission for sinners. Sky visits Sarah and invites her to have dinner with him in Havana; in return, he would bring one dozen sinners to the mission. Sarah refuses the deal, but when General Cartwright comes to New York to shutdown the mission, Sarah feels that the only chance to keep the mission operating is accepting Sky's invitation. They travel to Havana and fall in love with each other; but when they return to the mission, Sarah discovers that Nathan used the place for his crap game. Further, she believes that Sky has plotted the scheme to use her. Now Sky has to convince the gamblers and gangsters that arrived in New York to the crap game that they should go to the mission to help Sarah.</p>
<p>Every gambler in New York - and many from out of town - is waiting for Nathan Detroit to announce the location of his big craps game. There's only one problem: Detroit doesn't have the $1000 he needs to get the game going. When he sees gambler Sky Masterson he bets a $1000 that Masterson couldn't convince a girl of Detroit's choosing to go with him to Havana in the next 24 hours. Masterson accepts and Detroit chooses Sarah Brown, a Sergeant in the Salvation Army as the girl. Undaunted, Masterson sets out to seduce Sarah and get her to Havana. As far as Detroit is concerned, he's made a bet he can't lose. While Masterson woos Sarah, Detroit has to deal with his girlfriend of 14 years who has decided it's time they should get married.</p>
<p>In New York, a gambler is challenged to take a cold female missionary to Havana, but they fall for each other, and the bet has a hidden motive to finance a crap game.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, its the one where the gamblers find a sort of redemption in their dolls after much singing and dancing and stuff.  Maybe.  This film seems to have lived alongside me for years - round exam time, through getting ditched, you name it.  Sister Sarah and Sky and Nathan and Miss Adelaide and their chums were always there with those great Loesser melodies.  Top of the tree is the Luck Be A Lady number which Brando puts across quite nicely, despite hardly being a singer.  His great charm makes him a very good Sky.  The scenes in Havana are hilarious and Vivian Blaine back at the club gives good value in her two big stage numbers.  Looks like it belongs in a theatre, this film, but I bet you remember the tunes and huge chunks of the dialogue for a long time afterwards.</p>
