<h1>That Summer! (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two girls travel to Torquay in Devon from the North of England to work as chamber maids for the summer. They meet two boys, also in Torquay for the summer, one of whom (winstone) is entered in the "round the bay" swimming race. They have a run in with a gang of Scottish lads, one of whom (morrison) is also entered into the swimming race. Various confrontations ensue with Morrison and his friends framing Winstone for a robbery in a chemists shop. Winstone is arrested just as he is about to start the race. He escapes from the police and follows Morrison into the water, catches him up, forces him to confess to framing him and then goes on to win the race.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw the film in the cinema of SS Canberra on the way back from the Falklands in 82. The most memorable bit of the film is when the lead man is trying to get into the drawers of the lead girl. She stops him at the critical moment and asks: "You do love me don't you?" With that and in unison with Ray Winstone the entire audience of now Falkland Veterans chorused "Of course I do!" Brilliant! This film is a classic of the era, although filmed in 78 it captured the early 80s and the quoted lines above remind of my escapades before departing for the unknown in the South Atlantic. Ray Winstone certainly cut his teeth on films like this and archetypal the great Brit actor.</p>
