<h1>The Boxer (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David represents a young Tongan, Sunny, who is about to be deported for overstaying. Sunny is a boxer who has caught the eye of Wallace Culhane, a wealthy patron who is determined to turn Sunny pro and take him to the top. Sunny, however, doesn't want this - he wants to be a sculptor, takes David to a local park to show him the kind of sculpture he dreams of making. David, entirely sympathetic to Sunny's plight, has trouble finding grounds on which to argue an appeal against Sunny's deportation. David and Tim manage to buy Sunny some time when they discover that all the flights to Tonga are fully booked - the court can neither deport nor hold Sunny. However, Sunny's engagement to his New Zealand Samoan girlfriend Nicola is causing ructions with Nicola's furious father, who won't have his daughter marrying some fresh-off-the-boat arrival. David must navigate family tensions and Culhane's game-playing - which extends to having Sunny dropped from his under-the-table job. Melanie, meanwhile, finds herself out on the street when Freddo fails to pay rent at their flat. Tim bails her out with money, but Melanie puts it towards her rent arrears instead of a new place. Melanie pleads with Tim to let her move into his pristine flat, and Tim relents. However, Tim's not pleased when Freddo moves in as well, and insists that Mel get rid of him. Joni has problems of her own. On a dinner out with Adie and Judge Springer, Joni runs into Mark with an older woman. Joni discovers that Mark has been working a nice sideline - as an escort. Adie can't help but be amused, but Joni gives Mark the flick. Adie has also confided in Joni that she's made an official complaint to the Law Society about David's behavior in the Dean Stirling trial. Joni sits on the news. Peter isn't happy, however, when notification of the complaint arrives, and David doesn't treat it seriously. All hell breaks loose when Sunny and Nicola go missing - David and Samson try to track them down, worried that if Sunny misses his reporting time, he will surely face deportation. David finally finds Sunny at the sculpture studio. But Nicola's father isn't far behind David, and a furious argument breaks out. However, Nicola has news that changes everything: she is pregnant. This not only gives Sunny a good shot at residency, but it gradually brings Nicola's father Manuele around. Nicola and Sunny arrange a hasty wedding, and the office scrambles to organize partners for it. Joni makes a move towards reconciling with Kees when she invites him to the ceremony. David shows up with Louise, and while Joni tries to be cool about it, she's upset. But it's a happy ending for Nicola and Sunny, as Nicola's father Manuele finally accepts Sunny - and his unborn child - into the family.</p>
