<h1>Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film showcases Noam Chomsky, one of America's leading linguists and political dissidents. It also illustrates his message of how government and big media businesses cooperate to produce an effective propaganda machine in order to manipulate the opinions of the United States populous. The key example for this analysis is the simultaneous events of the massive coverage of the communist atrocities of Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodia and the suppression of news of the US supported Indonesian invasion and subjugation of East Timor.</p>
<p>A film about the noted American linguist/political dissident and his warning about corporate media's role in modern propaganda.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the five best educational tools not in use in the United States. A film so deep and full of non-stop, reality-busting evidence that Â—what you see ISN'T what you get in America.Chomsky is arguably the most intelligent political observer on Earth today. Its easy to be the Plunderer and commit the atrocities... its far more difficult to uncover the plots, organize the facts, and be vigilant of the actions. This is Must-See Media for the masses!Americans are too busy to begin think outside the box. This is 2h46m of intensive training in true democratic responsibility. Chomsky may favor the social structure of an early 20th century Kibbutz, but certainly his lessons of observation would stand well for any social structure. If you are not bought and owned by the system... you owe it to your children or your immortal soul...or karmic rebirth, to wake up and smell the fascism.</p>
