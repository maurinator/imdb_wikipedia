<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I was an 8 years old boy, owning video set was forbidden in my cursed country, Iran. Those days we were at eight years war with Iraq. In such bad situation, old movies on Betamax video tapes were our family's only fun whereas that was so risky due to country's law .You would have been arrested if it was proved that you have videotapes at home. My father was MD and one of his clients used to rent tapes although illegally. I watched so many great movies, mostly classics, in this way in that time. One of most memorable movies among them was "Griffin & Phoenix: A love story". It was a dubbed version & Its Persian title was "The kite" apparently because of emphasized presence of that motif in the storyline. This name had remained on this movie since before Iranian revoloution in 1979. After I saw the movie; I was stuck into that although I was so little. I watched that Betamax tape over & over again in the next years. Oh my god! It was amazing! The film's impact on me sustained so. I don't know anything about my childish reaction to this movie but now, I certainly can say It's brilliant, a film in the mood of 70s nihilistic cinema with anarchistic characteristics. This movie just made after a highly admired movie, "Love story" by Arthur Hiller, and after that Swedish director, Roy Anderson, Had made his own version of love story in the title of "A Swedish love story". "Griffin & Phoenix: A love story" is a deconstructive adaptation of love story, having less sentiment & added some intelligence with a mentored attitude toward the life. The message is straight: Nothing will be remaining from human except those moments spent on delight and love. I don't believe in an outside realm. All we can get is in this life although all the things have to be faded away gradually, Likewise me, likewise my Betamax videotapes. Unfortunately I have no longer a version of my lovely favorite movie. Sad but true.</p>
