<h1>A Hungarian Fairy Tale (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shot in B&W;, Gyula Gazdag's film follows the surreal and often comic quests of young Andris, an orphan searching for a father who doesn't exist, and Orban, a government clerk who's had enough of oppressive bureaucracy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautiful story of a young boy's search for his "father" after his mother is accidently killed. His search takes him on several adventures leading him closer and closer to his goal. The boy, David Vermes, looking for all the world like a pre-adolescent Marlon Brando,gives a lovely performance -understated and moving. The fantasy elements were delightful and I found myself smiling with joy at the end of the film. You will too!</p>
