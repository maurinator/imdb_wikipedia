<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember seeing this film at the Plaza Theatre in NYC when I was in high school.  We were all fans of Downey's earlier film like PUTNEY SWOPE & GREASER'S PALACE.  This was the most disturbing.  With a 360 shot real dog are replaced by actors.  They fornicate, sniff each others rears and for some reasons there's a penguin dressed as Andy Warhol look-a-like who when he dies goes to a cocktail part out of Warhol's Factory Day.  It's all very surreal and funny until the end.  Who can't love a movie that contains the line "I'd glady give you my heiney for glass of ice tea."  GREAT MOVIE Never released on video.  I'd trade my copy of WHO KILLED TEDDY BEAR for this '70's classic</p>
