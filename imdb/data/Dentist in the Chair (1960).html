<p>Burglar steals Dentistry equipment by mistake and tries to sell them to Student Dentists. Mild amusements follow.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When a thief doing what he promises to be his last job accidentally burglarises a Dentistry Suppliers instead of the "Silver Shop" next door he decides to flog the suitcase full of tools to a couple of dental students. Some very uncomplicated complications ensue before the thief confesses all to the police.I guess this was part of an attempt to make another series along the lines of the "Doctor" films which were popular at the time but this is a cheap cut rate imitation and has not stood the test of time well.The print being shown on British TV at the time of writing is curious in that it seems to be missing a reel (between Bob Monkhouse's character being summonsed to see the Dean and the Poster for the party going up)- not that it makes the slightest bit of difference as the story is so flimsy and predictable that it hardly matters.A couple of mildly amusing moments but nothing worth waiting for.</p>
