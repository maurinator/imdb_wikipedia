<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Camila" is a love story set in Colonial Argentina.  Camila is a young woman hungry for change and knowledge of the unknown. She meets Ladislao, a young priest whom with she immediately falls in love with.  The two decide to escape in order to fulfill their desire for each other.  They settle in a remote village but still must face the consequences of their decision. Directed by Maria Luisa Bemberg, "Camila" tells the story of a passionate woman who will fight for what she desires and is willing to sacrifice everything for it.  The film is true to the times in which it is based and true to the characters it is based on.  Rosas, the dictator at the time, is portrayed in a way that is also true to history.  The director Bemberg is also a passionate woman and filmmaker who struggled with censorship in the making of this film, but prevailed.  Although it is based on real people, some of the characters are shaped in order to benefit the ideals of the director, but a good film nonetheless.  I also recommend  "I, the Worst of All" by the same director.</p>
