<h1>Back Roads (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A prostitute and a drifter find themselves bound together as they make their way through the rural South, doing what they have to do to survive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Martin Ritt reunites with Sally Field (Norma Rae) playing a prostitute going on a road trip with drifter boxer Tommy Lee Jones. I think it was intended as a grimy tough rom-com. But whether it's the script or the much rumored bad relationship between Field and Jones, the couple was plagued with anger.The movie is filmed in a low rent 70s style Grime-o-Vision. It works sometimes like playing pinball in a roadside bar. But mostly it looks like a poorly made indie.In the end, the relationship never blossoms as it's suppose to. Sally Field does have a good breakdown, but Tommy Lee Jones have the acting range of a grumpy old man.</p>
