<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Narcissus" from over 30 years ago is the last work of Academy Award winning (mostly) short film director Norman Mclaren. As usual with his works, this is a production by the National Film Board of Canada and basically a ballet re-enactment of the tragic ancient Narcissus story, the one about the guy who loved nobody really as much as himself, especially his own looks. None of the 3 "actors" in here appeared in any other film again. I guess they were just professional ballet dancers. Jean-Louis Morin, who plays the central character, died in the 1990s still at a very young age to HIV. As I wrote in the title, this is basically nothing but slightly over 20 minutes of ballet. With this description, you can already decide for yourself how much you want to see that. I cannot say that it has a big impact on me when it is on screen, but then again I am probably not exactly the biggest ballet fan out there. McLaren had lots of dance in his movies and this one is no exception. I did not enjoy this watch. Thumbs down.</p>
