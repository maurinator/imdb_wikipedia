<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my favorite movie lines is, "Can I call you dad?" Caddyshack was described as "slob humor," and this exercise in vulgarity is a double-guilty pleasure.There are excellent gags-- Rodney flying into the Christmas tree, Rodney flipping channels past The Lost Weekend-- and good supporting performances. Joe Pesci clipping his underarm hair says it all.And, underneath all of the roughneck recklessness, there's a pretty well written movie.Thanks, Rodney.</p>
