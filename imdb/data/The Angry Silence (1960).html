<h1>The Angry Silence (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The right of every individual to be different from his fellow men is the theme behind this internationally-hailed, British production. The story tells of a man's dilemma when he refused to participate in an unofficial strike, where he works. While vicious, calculated violence brings the other dissenters into line, he goes it alone and is sent to Coventry (given the silent treatment) by his fellow workers. A stirring, thought-provoking film that portrays the human problems and high emotions generated when a man dares to act on the courage of his convictions and dares fight to keep his individual freedom.</p>
<p>A young factory worker decides to stand up against his work-mates and fellow union members when they want to hold a wildcat strike.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film which shows how Britains factories worked in the 50s,a place which employs thousands of people,usually on low wages.The workers only protection is their union which of course is only fair.Then the union is taken over by a few dedicated  socialists who then are manipulated by the far lft. .Everything that happens in this film is true to life,and shows that adults soon behave like spoilt children when they don't get there own way.The rights of the individual are soon gone,violence and bullying follows,the film ask questions and leaves you asking your self questions at the end.Well worth a watch 8/10</p>
