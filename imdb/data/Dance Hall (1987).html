<h1>Dance Hall (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this short film, our unemployed hero finds that getting that great job depends a lot on whom you choose to dance with at Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall.</p>
<p>Sam Logan is a young executive who's just lost his job, and is finding it impossible to make the connections necessary to be considered for a good opportunity. He runs into his acquaintance Cal, who tells him that all the best business connections are made at a small, little-known downtown club. Intrigued, Sam forgoes his scheduled job interview in order to accompany Cal to the club, which he finds to be a bit odd in its ritualized social activities; but he gamely plays along, hoping to get his big break.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Down on his luck and between jobs since his last employer was bought out and the workforce downsized, Sam sits alone on a park bench.  He is about to go to another job interview when he bumps into his friend Cal who seems to have no trouble getting high-powered jobs.  Cal takes him to a place where he makes all his contacts - an all male dance hall where executives dance and broker deals as old style music plays in the background.I wasn't sure entirely what to expect from the film but how could I not watch a film with a title like that?!  The film takes a few moments to really get going but once it does it is actually very good for audiences that will be able to see it in the context of management and executive style jobs.  In fairness the digs it makes apply to lower level jobs too - over the past eight years I have had three `proper' jobs and all but the first one came about thanks to contacts.  The film highlights the politics of the dancehall in the same way as making contacts in the business world - eg no one wants to dance with the `dead meat', some dancers are full of hot air and friendships will not be allowed to get in the way of progress.  It is slight but it is funny, having enough material to last for the running time without really repeating any jokes.It is a little depressing as, like the corporate world, the rest of us dance to the tune that is chosen by those with power (literally in the case of this film!).  The cast are pretty good and Gaines is a likeable lead who is an `ordinary guy' slightly lost in the sea of big men.  He carries the narrative well and the support cast is amusing and includes quite a few well known faces including Rasche and Wuhl.Overall I found this to be slight but a funny and observant little piece about relationship between people in the corporate world of business. Those who have tried to progress in the white collar world may well see quite a few people and habits that they recognise, but even if you are unemployed there is enough to enjoy here in a witty little short.</p>
