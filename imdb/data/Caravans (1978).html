<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I actually watched this movie being filmed while living in Isfahan, Iran in the last 1970s. My father worked for an American company, and I was in high school---there were actually 10,000 Americans living in Isfahan, (including families with children) before the revolution got underway and the evacuations of non-essential personnel started.I haven't seen the movie since the time it first came out, but I do remember that (a) the score was quite good (b) although the plot of the original Michener novel dealt with Afghanistan, and although the adaptation may have put the "location" of the action near the Pakistani border, the filming of exterior sequences took place within an hour's drive of Isfahan, VERY far from the Pakistani border.</p>
