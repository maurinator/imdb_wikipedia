Meanwhile, he also starts a relationship with a postal clerk.</p>
<p>The drifter Vann Siegert is a polite and good looking man that does not drink, who drives his truck without specific destiny. When he sees people that he thinks deserve to die, he simply poisons them and hides their bodies. He has also daydream with two federal agents. When he settles in a small town, he is lodged by a couple with problems, gets a job in the post office and starts a relationship with his colleague Ferrin.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Typical Sundance film: weird and off beat. Vann Siegert is not your usual serial killer; no, he slays in peculiar ways. Siegert, a likable drifter, is starting to come unraveled but manages to keep his dark side locked away and his secrets his own. Good drama: thumbs up.</p>
