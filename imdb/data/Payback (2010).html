<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mumbai-based Kunal Sahay has just broken up with his girlfriend, Ishita Sahani, who is about to re-locate to Germany, gets involved in an vehicular accident. No one is ready to assist him until an unknown male drives him to the hospital. A grateful Kunal recovers and returns to work with the Great Life Insurance Company and his room-mate, Rohit Sharma, an aspiring Bollywood actor. Kunal does meet with the unknown male, Raghu Satoskar, and gives him his address, and offers to do whatever he can for saving his life. A few days later, Raghu shows up at Kunal's residence, bleeding from a bullet wound. Kunal takes him to a doctor, has the bullet removed, and even loans him his car - only to have it damaged. Kunal then seeks Ishita's help and together they escort him to a nearby Police Station and fill out a statement that they had found Raghu bleeding on the sidewalk. Hoping to put this incident behind, they return to Kunal's flat - this is where Ishita will be abducted and held by goons until and unless Kunal brings in Raghu, who is an assassin-for-hire, and has just killed Dada Bhosle. With the latter in police custody - how will Kunal ensure Ishita's safe return?</p>
<p>A man decides to re-pay a good Samaritan but regrets doing so after he finds out that he is an assassin.</p>
