<h1>Are You Being Served? (2015)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The staff are being extra specially nice on the eve of the annual airport awards. Everybody wants to win the coveted award for customer service, but not everyone is impressed by the customer care that they are getting - Kosmos and Harry can't get a flight back to London, and Will is left high and dry after a night on the town, but he only has himself to blame. The medical team rally around when a British backpacker puts his foot in it, and we meet an airport doctor who is so popular that he has his own fan club.</p>
