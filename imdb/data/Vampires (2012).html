<h1>Vampires (2012)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>What if there were a show that followed the lives of real vampires all over the world? That's exactly what this project does. Around the world there are people who really do feed off the energy - and the blood - of others to get through their everyday lives. They have communities in New York, New Orleans, Paris and many other major cities. The first part of the series follows one such community in New Orleans. They let us into their lives: their jobs, how they "feed," their code of ethics, and how the community works. We examine the vampire myths of New Orleans and the real vampire community there, finding familiar stories and unexpected realities.</p>
