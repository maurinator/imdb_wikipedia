<h1>Bambi (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gene opens with a negative review of Big Top Pee Wee (1988) which he and Roger found problematic because Pee Wee had been put into the real world. Neither liked Monkey Shines: An Experiment in Fear (1988) which they thought was overstuffed. They were both enthusiastic about the comedy A Fish Called Wanda (1988) which Roger thought was the funniest movie of the year, but Gene liked but still preferred Bull Durham (1988). They split on Mr. North (1988), Gene liked the sweetness, Roger thought it was boring. Finally, both Roger and Gene have great admiration for Walt Disney's Bambi (1942) but Roger questions the appropriate age for children to see the film.</p>
