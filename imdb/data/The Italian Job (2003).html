Thinking the team dead, he returns to L.A. with the gold. Charlie and the survivors of this betrayal follow Steve L.A. to exact revenge against the traitor. Charlie enlists the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron) - a professional safe cracker, to get revenge. With Stella and the hacking skills of Lyle (Seth Green), the explosives skills of "Left Ear" (Yasiin Bey), and the driving skills of "Handsome" Rob (Jason Statham) this new team plans and executes a daring heist that weaves through the freeways and subways of L.A.</p>
<p>A gang of robbers, lead by career criminal Charlie Croker, create the largest traffic jam in Los Angeles history, giving them time to pull off a theft of gold bullion.

Enter Stella, a beautiful nerves-of-steel safecracker, who joins Charlie and his former gang when they follow the backstabber to California, where they plan to re-steal the gold by tapping into Los Angeles' traffic control system, manipulating signals and creating one of the biggest traffic jams in LA history. Now the job isn't the payoff, it's about payback.</p>
<p>After being betrayed and left for dead in Italy, Charlie Croker and his team plan an elaborate gold heist against their former ally.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Italian Job is not an awful movie.  But it is certainly no Ocean's 11. It brings nothing new to the heist genre.  The performances are all decent, but it doesn't really seem like any of the actors are excited to be in the movie.  Compared with recent heist fare like The Heist and The Score, and with other films out this summer, I would have to recommend the Italian Job, though it isn't anything special.</p>
