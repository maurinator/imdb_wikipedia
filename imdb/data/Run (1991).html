<p>Boston law student and part-time mechanic Charlie Farrow is asked by his boss to deliver a new Porsche from Boston to Atlantic City for a client. Close to Atlantic City, the Porsche breaks down. While Charlie waits for the car to be repaired, a cab driver, who has mistaken Charlie for being an Atlantic City high roller, takes him to a casino that has a bar room and kitchen, so Charlie can get something to eat. At the casino, Charlie earns the wrath of Denny Halloran, who takes exception to Charlie's beating him at poker. In the ensuing fight, Denny trips, hits his head on the sharp corner of the counter, and dies. Denny was the son of crime boss Matt Halloran, the owner of the casino, the police force, and the town. Wrongfully accused of murdering Denny, Charlie finds himself on the run from both the cops and Matt's henchmen. And the bodies start piling up. Can Charlie survive Matt's wrath and convince the cops of his innocence?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie only once, on the small screen, but I put it in my top 10 of most anxiously awaited DVDs. A college student finds himself on the wrong side of town (intentionally), but ends up doing some very bad things (not intentionally) that make him the subject of a man hunt by a mobster who definitely doesn't respect a suspects rights. The kid has one choice -- Run! A Great Non-Stop Adrenaline Rush!</p>
