<h1>A Very Special Favor (1965)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a flick that will definitely not leave a bad taste in your mouth. There are lots and lots of slapstick laughter. The casting is perfect: Rock Hudson, Leslie Caron, Charles Boyer, Walter Slezak & Dick Shawn among others that are all long gone. What makes me so upset is it is the only Rock Hudson Romantic Comedy that hasn't been put on video. Posters & movie stills are floating around for people to purchase, but the video is positively not available. If all of this memorabilia is available, then why not the video? Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back, Send Me No Flowers & Man's Favorite Sport have all been made available. These are often shown on television too. This hysterical romantic comedy has only been at the theaters and shown only on television just ONE time. It is a feel good story that will most certainly warm everyone's hearts. We need more happiness today to be able to feel good. It will most assuredly make you split your sides laughing to the point of tears. I have been looking for the video forever. Fortunely I was able to find the book; which is the next best thing to being able to see the movie. So the book will have to do until they decide to come out with the video.</p>
