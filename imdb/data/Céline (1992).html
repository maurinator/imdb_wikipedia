<h1>Céline (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At 22, Céline receives several shocks: her father dies and she learns she was adopted; she rejects her inheritance, so her fiancé jilts her. She's suicidal. A nurse sees her weeping in public and takes her home. Her mother hires the nurse, Geneviève, to care for Céline; Geneviève imposes the same work and meditation regime she herself used to recover from similar depression two years before. The film plays out the resulting dynamics: Céline has mystical success in meditation, and neighbor children discover she has healing powers. Yet life remains painful. Meanwhile, the friendship is now the center of Geneviève's life. When Céline leaves, Geneviève must cope anew with loss.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is Jean Claude Brisseau's most beautiful film. Perhaps not the best, but for sure the one who contains more beauty. The character of Celine, quite mysterious, with a past that we barely know and a present of sadness, distress and suicidal tendencies will become the purest of Brisseau's career, the maximum aspiration of a director such interested in magic as a part of our lives, as something that is there, in every corner and that can save (or corrupt) our entire existence. Lisa Heredia, as the nurse, pragmatic and quite, represents the other point of view if we are not able to watch the film in his right sense. It's her and his capacity to believe what makes possible the impossible. Marvellous musical interludes from Georges Delerue and a superb cinematography by the not well known but great Romain Winding.</p>
