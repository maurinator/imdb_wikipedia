<h1>Faust (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The aging scientist Faust is desperately in search of knowledge and insight, but without success. To escape from this ignorance, he dares the extreme: He joins forces with the devil. Mephisto offers him eternal youth and the opportunity to seduce the virgin Gretchen.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen many Versions of Goethes Faust, but the one with Gustaf Gruendgens and Willi Quadflieg is the best I have ever seen. The Plot should be clear. Gustaf Gruendgens plays Mephisto. It is the Role that made him live forever. He dominates the play, often on cost of the other actor, but it is magnificent. It is a must to see.</p>
