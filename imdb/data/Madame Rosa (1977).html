<h1>Madame Rosa (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Madame Rosa lives in a sixth-floor walkup in the Pigalle; she's a retired prostitute, Jewish and an Auschwitz survivor, a foster mom to children of other prostitutes. Momo is the oldest and her favorite, an Algerian lad whom she raises as a Muslim. He asks about his parents; she answers evasively. As she ages and takes fewer children, Momo must do more for her; as money is tight, he tries to earn pennies on the street with a puppet. He's a beautiful man-child, and Madame Rosa makes him promise never to sell himself or become a pimp. A film editor, Nadine, befriends him, and his father appears as well. Madame Rosa reaches her last days in fear of hospitals, and Momo must act.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>for me, it is special. because it represents almost a slice of memories. madame Rosa has many faces. she is silhouette of many persons. and fantastic art of Simone Signoret gives new powerful nuances to an old portrait. story of an old woman and a boy. the lady can be a grandmother or aunt but, in this case, she is only a single pray of time. the boy, if you has a little courage in sauce of imagination, he is you. in moments of old age. sure, the theme is not new. but the work of Gary novel, art of Moshe Mizrahi, the colors of a universe out of reasonable limits, the dialogs and the looks, all is unique. it is recipes of a life lesson. but, in same measure, it remains a confession. to yourself, viewer of an alternative existence, touching story who may be yours.</p>
