<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in the movies as a kid. When it came out on VHS I bought it and my kids became fans. I still have it on VHS and wish I had it on DVD. Everyone is superb and all the gags are great. I love the end where they're in the van with the church music playing.Jim Hutton was a great actor and this is one of the funniest things he did. He is surrounded by an absolutely hilarious supporting cast. It's a well-made farce and the premise is so ridiculous that everything becomes even funnier as the movie goes on.I've asked countless people in my life if they've ever seen this movie and they say they haven't even heard of it. It's a pity because it's really a delightful movie. I loved it, my kids loved it and I hope my grandkids love it. I just wish it would come out on DVD!!!</p>
