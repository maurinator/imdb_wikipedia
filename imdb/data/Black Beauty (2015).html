<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me just say I loved the book and the previous movies and was really looking forward to this. But I just could not relate to a 30-year-old trying to play a 15-year-old girl. Really? Maybe it was the actresses fault but I believe it was a major mistake in casting. What? Are there no young actresses anymore? I honestly didn't get past the first 10 minutes. Maybe this is not a fair review but I was looking to get lost in a sappy girl and her horse story and it just was not even the tiniest bit believable. The whole introductory sequence seemed very stilted and forced. The horse is pretty at least. Oh, the actress Sarah Ann Schultz is lovely but so obviously NOT a teenager. She appeared to be older than her mom even. A pity because I imagine the story was exactly what I was looking for but I couldn't get past her age. Two thumbs down for me.</p>
