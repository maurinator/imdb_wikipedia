<h1>Djomeh (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Djomeh is a young Afghan man who has come to live in Iran because of family trouble. Working as a milk boy, he encounters discrimination from the Iranian villagers and disdain from Habib, a fellow Afghani to whose trust Djomeh was given. The only person who shows any friendliness to him is his employer, who Djomeh asks to intercede for him in asking a woman from the village for her hand in marriage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this film applies a simple approach to life, focusing on the small details of characterization rather than driven by plot.  In particular, what drives this film is the performance of the lead, at times maddeningly stubborn but always with a childlike quality of hopefulness and optimism.  This is a beautiful film whose ending leaves one pondering friendship, love, and the ups and downs of everyday life.  That sounds corny when written down, but the film is anything but overly sentimental.</p>
