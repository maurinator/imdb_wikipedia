<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'It's a Romy Schneider film!', my mum said happily when she read the announcement in her TV guide. It is indeed, but I didn't quite dare inform my mum of the contents, seeing as she knew Romy only by the Sissi films. I love this film. I immediately fell in love with Lilli Palmer. Perhaps not as important or shocking as the 1931 version (yes, I have seen it) but still an interesting film. I especially like the outdoors shots in this film. The scene where Fräulein Von Bernburg gives Manuela one of her own shirts is lovely. I understood Romy Schneider was attempting to lose her Sissi image at the time. She succeeded in my opinion. My mum was somewhat surprised after watching it, but in the end she decided she liked it after all. So do I. Seven points out of ten.</p>
