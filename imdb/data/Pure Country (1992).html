<h1>Pure Country (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dusty Chandler (Strait) is a super star in the country music world, but his shows have the style of a '70s rock concert. One day he takes a walk - out of his overdone concerts to find his real country roots. He's helped and hindered by friends and staff, but pushes on in his search for a real music style as well as a real romance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whether you are a fan of country music like I am or not, if you don't enjoy this movie or the story it tells, there's something wrong with you! We need more movies like this one. A man is looking for more simplicity and for love in his life which is something we should all strive for. There are too many movies focused on the hip hop culture today. There are so many country fans out there that would love to see more movies like this one. George Strait did an excellent job as did the rest of the cast. It's topped off with an incredible song, 'Cross My Heart' The soundtrack is also a winner. If you have not seen this, be sure to check it out soon!</p>
