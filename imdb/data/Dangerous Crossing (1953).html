<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie so much!! One of, in my opinion, the best mysteries ever!! Great acting by everyone involved and a pleasure to watch--believe me, you won't fall asleep watching this one. It is very atmospheric in some scenes, especially the night shots on board.All about a bride who boards a ship for her honeymoon and her husband disappears while on the ship!! Not until the last few minutes do we finally know what happened to him!! Be sure and see this film and you won't be disappointed!! I only wish this great film would be released on DVD. I would be among the first to buy it!! I love this film so much I bought an original poster for the film and had it framed and it now hangs in my bedroom!!</p>
