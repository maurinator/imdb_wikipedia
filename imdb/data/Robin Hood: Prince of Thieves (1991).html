<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>***MAY CONTAIN LITTLE SPOILERS***I watched "The Prince of Thieves" once again two days ago and it is still one of the most brilliant movies ever made. Despite the fact the crew had so many obstacles while making the film.Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) returns to England from his crusades with a Maori warrior Azeem (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and finds out that the evil sheriff of Nottingham (superb Alan Rickman) has taken over his fathers lands. From that one there begins a war to make a difference in sheriff's terrorizing Nottingham. Robin becomes Hood and he is fighting to give the good days back to the people as they deserve it. There is a little bit of everything in the film. There is adventures, excitement, romance, humor, action. Everything you could ever wish from the great, enjoyable film! If you liked "The Adventures of Robin Hood" starring by Errol Flynn you will also enjoy this timeless story about the man who stole from the rich and gave it to the poor!The film making was a struggle right from the start. The producers had some difficulties to hire a competent director to the job. Even the production manager and the other heads of department were hired before the director. There was a bit hurry to make "Prince of Thieves" because there was two other Robin Hood pictures coming. They were just like in a race. Then a man called Kevin Reynolds was hired to the job of directing. Then the production team was short of lead actor to play Robin. Other major parts Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman and Christian Slater were already in place. Robin Wright was replaced with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio to play Maid Marian because of Wright's pregnancy. Then there came Kevin Costner. He only signed up for the job because of Kevin Reynolds. After casting everybody the working team came across the difficulty of the lack of enough time. There was also some rough times between Costner and Reynolds. Even the guys had some disagreement the film opened in the year 1991 and managed to snatch a 25 million dollars at the opening weekend and was later going to bag 390 million dollars worldwide. Not bad if the production had some of bad critic and problems behind them. Obviously even Costner and Reynolds managed to put their hatred aside because later they teamed up in the flop "Waterworld" which was by the way then (1995) the most expensive movie in the world! (Whopping 175 million dollars spent) Even if the film contains some of the most disturbing mistakes in film making it does not effect on the result. So what if Robin's hair is suddenly turn from wet to dry and again back to wet it does not reflect to the essence of this marvelous piece of history. It is worth waiting the last scene where legendary Sean Connery makes an appearance as King Richard the Lionheart! (Connery donated his 400,000 dollar fee to charity)The legendary and undying ballad "Everything I Do (I Do It For You) by Bryan Adams is the best movie theme song in the history of film making!Worth to watch with it's faults and all!</p>
