<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Susan Hayward was at her best in this very sympathetic role portraying singer Jane Froman.... She looked beautiful throughout the entire production, even during the plane crash sequence....N o one lip synched better than Hayward !(also synched in Ill Cry Tomorrow, although might have done some of her vocalizing there.)...beautiful heartwarming story, how accurate,? will never know, it was an entertainment... and it entertained... The soundtrack/score is exceptional, especially the Americana medley...Thelma Ritter once again is a scene stealer... beautiful blue eyed Rory Calhoun, plays and looks his part well, and Robert Wagner was also a standout, in a minor, but moving role.. Why is this no longer available on Video?? It hasnt been for over 20 years... Thanks to AMC, Ive  seen it again afew times. and luckily I do have the soundtrack lp on Vinyl....Hayward fans incl. myself should demand this film to be re-issued on Video & DVD !!!!</p>
