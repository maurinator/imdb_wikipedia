<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is in my opinion the greatest Almodovar film ever!  Its funny and serious, but mainly farscical, but its brilliant.  Carmen Maura steals the show as a woman close to the edge, but her performance is fully backed up by all the rest of the cast.  Antonio Banderas performance is excellent as a geeky young man, with his girlfriend and mother also shining.  It combines all the elements of American comedy of the sixties but brings it back at us with a touch of latin spirit.  This film in my opinion is a gem, for anyone who wants to laugh!</p>
