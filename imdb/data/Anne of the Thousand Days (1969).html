<h1>Anne of the Thousand Days (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Henry VIII of England discards one wife Katharine of Aragon, who has failed to produce a male heir, in favor of a young and beautiful woman, Anne Boleyn, whose one-thousand-day reign as Queen of England ends with the loss of her head on the block. Henry weds Ann and soon she gives him a child. The girl, Elizabeth, is a bitter disappointment to Henry, who desperately wants an heir. Anne promises Henry a son "next time," but Henry is doubtful. Shortly thereafter, rumors begin that the King's eye has already wandered. One Jane Seymour is at court for a moment. The Queen has her sent away, but, if Anne will bring Jane back to court, the King promises to sign the Act of Succession to insure that Elizabeth will be Queen.</p>
<p>King Henry VIII of England is contemplating what to do about his near 1,000 day union to his second wife, Anne Boleyn. The marriage has been controversial in that he, a devoutly religious man, had to break ties with the Catholic church in Rome so that he could divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, who he married for political reasons. As such, many of his subjects consider his marriage to Anne as being not valid and Anne a whore. The marriage to Anne has also been tempestuous as Anne wanted to marry the young Lord Percy, with whom she was in love. But Anne eventually learned to love the power that being Queen of England would bring, a position which was fostered by her family, who could only see the benefit of such a union. The King's current contemplation of what to do stems from what he sees as Anne not fulfilling her end of the marriage in not producing a viable male heir to become the next King of England, she only bearing a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stillborn son. He sees Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies in waiting, as being a potential queen in her place. As much as Henry will do whatever in his power to get that desired male heir (his union to Katherine also produced only a daughter), Anne, who Henry professes to love, will do anything to ensure what she considers her and Elizabeth's rightful place within the monarchy.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A good movie for all Tudor fanatics. I can't really see anything wrong with it. It was historically accurate and well-acted. It's one of those movies you can watch till the end, without stopping the tape. It helps to do a bit of research on the history of this story before you watch the movie, so that you have a better idea of what is going on. Overall, good job. Well done. I won't be pulling people off the street, demanding that they watch "Anne of the Thousand Days", but I will say that I enjoyed it very much.</p>
