<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches children, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know it all" doctor.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as Andy meets his old high school friend, Jed, things go even further "off the rails" than they already were, with a rapist stalking the college coeds in his care, as Dean of Students. Andy and his new wife, Tracy (Kidman) live in a Victorian "fixer-upper" in the fictional college town of Westerly, Massachusetts, a thinly veiled substitute for the well-known Smith College in Northampton, Mass., where this was primarily filmed. Aside from Andy's worries about his students, he is puzzled by his wife's casual reaction to a rapist in their midst and begins checking up on her. After meeting his high school classmate, "Gallopin'" Jed Hill, a quarterback and obvious ladies' man, he inexplicably invites him to move in with them to defray the living costs. Tracy seems upset by this but acquiesces, until Jed's first night there, involving loud sex with a nurse to the tune of "Mama Told me Not to come", is not a great start to his tenancy. Tracy complains vehemently and Andy offers to quiet them down but she holds him back, which is rather odd. Later on, Tracy is rushed to the ER with a ruptured ovarian cyst, just after a coed is attacked. Jed makes the fateful call to remove both her ovaries and she decides to sue him, setting in motion a huge insurance debacle which may or may not prove that Tracy isn't who she claims to be.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, there is a rapist attacking young women and Detective Dana is investigating the cases. The college professor Andy Safian and his former student and presently school teacher Tracy are happily married and are trying to have a baby. When the last victim of the rapist that studies at Andy's college is sent to the Saint Agnes Hospital, the surgeon Dr. Jed Hill saves her life. Andy recognizes Jed that had studied with him and they become close to each other. Soon Andy invites Jed to rent a room in his house to help him in the expenses despite Tracy's protest. When Tracy has a miscarriage, Jed takes the decision of removing her ovary with the support of Andy to save her life without waiting for the results from the laboratory. Soon he leans that Tracy's ovary was healthy and she decides to sue the hospital in US$ 20 million, using her friend, the lawyer Dennis Riley. Tracy leaves Andy and accuses Jed of God Complex. When another student of Andy's college is murdered by the rapist, Andy becomes a suspect and has to donate sperm to prove his innocence. When Detective Dana shows Andy the laboratory result that clears him, he finds that he is sterile. Now Andy decides to investigate his wife deeper and finds hidden secrets about her.</p>
<p>In a New England college town, there have been a rash of violent rapes against female students. Andy Safian, an associate dean at the college, is coming down hard on Detective Dana Harris and her team for their seeming inability to apprehend the rapist, leading to a sense of fear on campus. Andy is recently married to now Tracy Safian, a former student of his, they living in a Victorian house requiring many structural renovations. Beyond the house maintenance, their priority lies in starting a family. Into their life comes Dr. Jed Hill, a surgeon just moved into town to start work at the local hospital. Jed and Andy are former high school classmates, although Jed does not remember Andy having run in different social circles, Jed who was the big man on campus. Jed still maintains his extreme A-type personality, where in every aspect of his life, especially in the operating room, it is his way without question, either from subordinates, associates or even superiors. For each of their benefits, Andy offers Jed a room to rent in their house temporarily, the money which will help to pay for the necessary renovations. This decision does not sit well with Tracy, whose fears are realized as their respective lifestyles do not mesh. A specific incident will irreparably damage the individual relationships between Andy, Jed and Tracy. As this incident starts to play out on their individual lives, what appears on the surface may not be the entire story...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Becker's 'Malice' is a little bit of a mixed bag. First of all, there are two stories that hardly have anything to do with each other, one being about a serial killer raping and murdering collegegirls and another about a married couple and a doctor. Sorkin is a gifted writer as is evident in his work for TV but somehow the plot of 'Malice' is a bit contrived, messy and the screenplay lacks depth. The story would have been far more effective if the characters were better developed. There are plenty of twists and suspense but the surprise turns are a little out of place and it is hard to understand the motivation behind the characters' actions. For instance, why would Kidman's character allow herself to get so severely ill and risk her own life in the hands of someone else? Yet, 'Malice' is an entertaining thriller. The plot might be confusing at times but the performances are good, the dialogues are solid and it is technically well executed. The soundtrack flows well and some of the visuals are brilliant. Nicole Kidman is wonderful in spite of a poorly written character. Bill Pullman is great as the naive, passive, boring, pushover husband. Alec Baldwin, who plays Andy's counterpart is equally good. The supporting cast includes talented names life Anne Bancroft, Peter Gallagher, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bebe Neuarth but their screen time is limited. Bancroft stands out followed by Neuwarth and Gallagher. Overall, 'Malice' is a good enough fun watch if one is looking for something with a little but of suspense, clever dialogue and good acting but there's not much else to look forward to.</p>
