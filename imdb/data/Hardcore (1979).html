<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now that George C. Scott has passed away, many of my on-line acquaintances were citing selections from the movie "Patton" as their favorite on-screen quotes from the late actor.My personal favorite, however, comes from what was the turning point of Scott's character in this movie.  I pitied what Jake Van Dorn saw (then couldn't bear to see) as he watched his daughter coupling with the stringy-haired porn actor.  Then I pitied him more as he unsuccessfully tried to crash the porn world in search of his only child.  Finally, Scott made Van Dorn's final desperation palpable as he sat in the dimly lit motel room, head in his hands (although the toupee WAS hilarious) after "interviewing" the parade of hapless "actors" and "actresses".When Van Dorn raises his tired eyes to see that the individual who just entered his room is the stringy-haired actor ("Jism Jim"), Scott's acting, the camera flashbacks and the music made me lean very close to the screen. As Van Dorn showed his little girl's picture to Jim, who thereupon throws a tantrum ("That BI***, do I have to act with HER?  She made my c*** so...") I found myself very happy to watch Van Dorn beat the stuffing out of Jim with the table lamp.And the quote?  Van Dorn's, in George C. Scott's comforting, whiskey-cured voice as he prepares to shove Jim into a cold shower for some interrogation:"CHEER UP, YOU'RE NOT DEAD!"R. I. P. Mr. Scott.</p>
