<h1>Evdokia (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A prostitute (Evdokia) meets a sergeant (Yorgos). They fall in love and get married after a short love affair. Her profession, however, is a barrier for their relationship. They try to stay together and overcome their inner conflicts, but the social environment crushes them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Few people in Greece have actually seen this movie but almost everyone knows it due to the brilliant score by Manos Loizos. It's a very low budget movie, especially the sound dubbing is ludicrous, but nevertheless it still succeeds at being realistic and cruel. Maria Vassiliou is quite good while George Koutouzis is annoying and fake.</p>
