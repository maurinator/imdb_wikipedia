<h1>Midnight Ride (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A series of mysterious murders have happened in Montevideo, a small city in California. A policeman's wife is running away from her husband, trying to divorce him. The policeman tries to reconcile and begins to follow her...</p>
<p>After a heated argument with her military police turned cop husband, Lawson Russian immigrant house wife, Lara storms off into the night convinced he's more married to his job than her. On her drive to a friend's house, she takes pity on a mournful hitchhiker Justin Mckay, desperately searching for a ride. Her offer of a lift to him plunges her into a night of pure terror as Justin is seriously disturbed, twisted by a tortured childhood which ended in being made to see his little sister's shocking murder and mutilation at the hands of his brutal alcoholic mother (who took a butcher knife to her head and used it like a comb) who systematically slays anyone who harms or offends him on a murderous impulse, as he captures their dying moments on his Polaroid camera. As Lawson struggles to follow Lara despite a leg in plaster, he is left for dead by our Justin, but recovers and now must search the steadily darkening roads for Lara, while her deeply troubled captor Justin continues his uncontrollable slaughter-spree, rampaging through the night leaving behind carnage and fiery devastation on his path of madness.</p>
<p>A house wife just left her cop husband, when she picks up Justin Mckay she'll wish she never did as she's plunged into a nightmare and the grip of a psychotic killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, you can't deny that The Hitcher inspired this movie, and you think, sarcastically "Oh, I can just imagine". Well, I'd hate to say it, but you're wrong. I've seen this film, many a time. This quite tense movie has great plotting, and believe it, Hamill pulls off his hitch hiking psycho convincingly. I was impressed by the structure of the story, situation after situation. Sevina Gershak, really good, as are our four leads, plays a Russian immigrant married to cop Dudikoff. Obviously she's had enough. This seemingly arranged marriage isn't working, and I must admit, I did find Dudikoff irritating. Hopefully that hairy scene with him, tied down the front bonet of a car as it hurtles down a mountainside, woke him up a bit, and made he reevaluate his priorities, but I don't think it did too. Also to begin with, he's on crutches, so he's limping throughout. The guy doesn't learn. This film with it's violent moments, leads up to a little twist towards it's conclusion, never letting up on the tenseness of the film, where we're greeted with acting presence, Mitchum, who was Hamill's psychiatrist. I wish we had more screen time with Mitchum. Being a Hitcher fan, I had to see this out of curiosity, and while it's not as good as that cult classic, here's a tense B grader you shouldn't overlook, save for a stupid after ending scene with Hamill. The performances are good, though sometimes Hamill does ham it up, but it's fun seeing him in this role, and he does like taking photos too.</p>
