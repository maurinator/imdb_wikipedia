<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saw this on HBO with my parents one vacation.  I like this movie, it has a story which includes suspenses, horror, mystery and action.  Not too many movies have this combination.  Great acting by Shaw, his role is on par with Jaws.  The under water filming is the best of any under water film.  Then tension and fear with the under water scenes leave an impression on one's mind.  A classic shown on TBS late night, I will tape the next time I see it on.  They usually show the movie The Island afterwards, I never seen that one; I wonder if it is any good being the second feature.  Rent it, tape it, or buy it! You will not be disappointed.  8/10</p>
