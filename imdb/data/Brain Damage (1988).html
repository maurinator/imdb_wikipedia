<h1>Brain Damage (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A normal, average guy who lives in New York City becomes dependent on an evil, disembodied brain. The brain feeds the guy a narcotic substance in exchange for his unwilling assistance in obtaining the brains of innocent victims for sustenance. This turns into a tour of circa-1980s underground NYC clubs, backlots, and other seedy locations. One scene features the band Swimming Pool Cues playing the song "Corruption."</p>
<p>One morning a young man wakes to find a small, disgusting creature has attached itself to the base of his brain stem. The creature gives him a euphoric state of happiness but in return demands human victims.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is probably one of the best horror movies ive ever seen and on dvd its got a clear, crisp picture. Including theatrical trailer, commentary track, and soundtrack-only audio track. (it also includes a hidden trailer for Basket Case). Everything about it is just wonderful, a must buy! As for the movie its probably henenlotters best, truly tasteless with better effects than basket case and a more interesting story.</p>
