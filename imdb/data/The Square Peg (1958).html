<h1>The Square Peg (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Norman and Mr Grimsdale are council workmen mending the road outside an Army base when they come into conflict with the military. Shortly afterwards, they get drafted and fall into the clutches of the Sergeant they have just bested. They are sent to France to repair roads in front of the Allied advance but get captured. Norman takes advantage of a useful similarity to impersonate General Schreiber and manages to return a hero.</p>
<p>A British road repairman gets into a feud with the Army, gets drafted and is mistakenly parachuted into Nazi occupied France where his physical resemblance to the local German commandant triggers a hilarious chain reaction.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This service comedy (another favorite situation with star comedians) - part army-base shenanigans and part dangerous mission - ranks as possibly the best Norman Wisdom vehicle there is, with a consistent string of often hilarious gags and the star - turning up again in drag and also appearing in a dual role (including one as a Nazi General) - in top form.Supporting him are Edward Chapman (virtually rising to sidekick status here, he and Wisdom make an engaging comic pair), Honor Blackman (perhaps the most substantial of the star's leading ladies) and Hattie Jacques (as a German opera star).</p>
