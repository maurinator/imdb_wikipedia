<h1>The Poseidon Adventure (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Well done documentary on the fans of The Poseidon Adventure. First half features the 30th anniversary reunion/screening of the film put on by the Poseidon Adventure Fan Club in 2002. Second half focuses on a fan who lives in Arizona who has converted his house into a shrine to the film, and a musical update of the original movie that played in Los Angeles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, I've seen Poseidon Adventure a trillion times, it's a good flick, yadda yadda yadda. But I never realized how OBSESSED people are about this flick! These people are on the same level as Trekkies, if you can imagine that. As far as documentaries go, it's quite well done, and they cover everything that needs to be covered. But wow, I can't get over how far gone some of these Poseidon fans are. Would you make your own Poseidon Adventure musical? Or decorate your entire house like the ship and make your own Poseidon Adventure cast action figures? Didn't think so. See this documentary to be amused. It's quite...erm...yeah, amusing. And disturbing. And hilarious. And if they ever have another viewing at the Queen Mary, I'm SO going.</p>
