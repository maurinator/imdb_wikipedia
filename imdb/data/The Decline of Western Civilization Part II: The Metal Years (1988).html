<h1>The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Documentary showcase, what life was like for the music artists living during the Los Angeles Heavy Metal scene in the mid and late 1980s.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Every bit as funny as "This is Spinal Tap" but it's the real deal documentary and these poor guys aren't trying to be funny. Ozzy Osbourne is a gas. Every nobody interviewed was sure they'd be the next Steve Tyler. These dudes look like ladies.</p>
