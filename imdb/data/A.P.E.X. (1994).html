<h1>A.P.E.X. (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A time-travel experiment in which a robot probe is sent from the year 2073 to the year 1973 goes terribly wrong thrusting one of the project scientists, a man named Nicholas Sinclair into a plague ravaged alternate time-line whose war weary inhabitants are locked in a constant battle with killer robots which are automatically being sent there from Sinclair's lab. To escape this situation, Sinclair must find a similar time machine in this alternate world and prevent the disaster from ever happening.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Got this as a present about a month ago (don't ask!!) and watched it Christmas Day in work whilst on-call. I must say I never thought I would watch this film as I no longer have a VHS machine and the box didn't exactly inspire me but since there is a TV with built in Video in work I thought it would pass the time. It certainly did. I reckon the acting was good and the story believable (I know this sounds ridiculous)You could tell they didn't have much of a budget but made the most of it. They certainly didn't like showing the robots being blown up as they probably cost a few bob to construct them. All in all a damn good 2 hours not wasted.</p>
