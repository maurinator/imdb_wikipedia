<h1>The Emperor's New Clothes (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Napoleon, exiled, devises a plan to retake the throne. He'll swap places with commoner Eugene Lenormand, sneak into Paris, then Lenormand will reveal himself and Napoleon will regain his throne. Things don't go at all well; first, the journey proves more difficult than expected, but more disastrously, Lenormand enjoys himself too much to reveal the deception. Napoleon adjusts somewhat uneasily to the life of a commoner while waiting, while Lenormand gorges on rich food.</p>
<p>In this re-imagining of the final years of Napoleon, loyalists hire a lookalike to swap places with the deposed emperor during his exile. While the impostor wallows in luxury on the island of St. Helena, the real Napoleon returns to Paris.</p>

<p>I probably would not have seen this movie if not for the rave reviews I read here.  There were so many positive comments, it seemed I couldn't go wrong. You were all correct.Thanks to everyone who reviewed this film.  It was absolutely superb! The characters and story line were very good.  It could have happened the way it was shown.A wonderful, warm, charming, funny film.  Don't miss this one. I gave it a 10/10.</p>
