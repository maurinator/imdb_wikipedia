<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really love this episode. I especially love the title card (listed below). It's so funny. I love inside jokes like that. This episode is one of my all-time favorite episodes from this season.In this episode, The Cul-de-sac Crew go nuts when they start playing dodgeball. They get angry, violent, and super competitive. Meanwhile, Grayson gets into a fight with Jules about what she prays for, and Travis, and Bobby can't spend as much time with Bobby as they would like, thanks to a new girl he's dating.Title Card: Welcome to Cougar Town. This episode is funnier if you know that Courteney is terrified of birds. Overall, I give this episode a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.</p>
