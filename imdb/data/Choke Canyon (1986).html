<h1>Choke Canyon (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pilgrim Corporation has leased Choke Canyon to research physicist David Lowell for 99 years. Lowell has built an impressive research laboratory there. When Pilgrim suddenly needs Choke Canyon for toxic waste storage, they resort to violence to force out the renitent Lowell. However, Pilgrim Corportation vastly underestimates Lowell, who is a tenacious, principled, and ingenious man.</p>
<p>A "cowboy"-scientist is fighting a corporation who wants to dump atomic waste on a piece of land he has leased.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Park logic at the door, because the science behind the scientific experiments in "Choke Canyon" is ridiculous. The acting by everyone except Lance Henriksen is below average. Speaking of Lance, his part is not particularly well written, nor very important. In other words a waste of Henriksen. The only redeeming factor is some nice red rock photography, and some really wild and impressive stunt work. I really can't recommend sitting through all the nonsense that precedes the aerial acrobatics however. If the story had been more logical and better developed, this could have been a fairly decent film, but unfortunately that was not to be. Ah me! - MERK</p>
