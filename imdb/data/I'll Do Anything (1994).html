<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Matt Hobbs is a talented but unsuccessful actor. When estranged (and strange) ex-wife Beth dumps their daughter Jeannie on Matt, father and daughter have a lot of adjusting to do. His budding relationship with attractive production assistant Cathy Breslow is made complicated, while the precocious child is overly accustomed to getting her own way. Matt eventually faces the choice of family vs career in a particularly difficult way.</p>
<p>This movie is about an actor that has had trouble getting a job in the past two years. His wife is forcing him to take his daughter home with him, despite the fact that he has no money. Little does he know, she won't be staying for the "3 weeks" his ex requested, she will be staying for a few years!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an excellent movie with interesting, well-drawn characters, especially that of complicated little girl.  Nolte gives one of his great performances as the sensitive actor-father.  This movie didn't get the attention it deserved when it came out, because it had become known that it was originally planned as a musical, but the musical numbers were cut out after audience testing  --  which was ironic, since the movie had many references to audience-testing movies.  They could have turned all that on its ear by having a closing-credits sequence with the producers audience testing the movie and deciding to PUT IN musical numbers, and then running excerpts of the excised musical numbers.  The critics would have been confused as to whether it had really ever been planned to be a musical in the first place, and it would have brilliantly augmented the subject-matter of the movie.</p>
