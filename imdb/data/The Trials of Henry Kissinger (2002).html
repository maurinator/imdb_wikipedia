<h1>The Trials of Henry Kissinger (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Part contemporary investigation and part historical inquiry, documentary follows the quest of one journalist in search of justice. The film focuses on Christopher Hitchens' charges against Henry Kissinger as a war criminal - allegations documented in Hitchens' book of the same title - based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and Indonesia. Kissinger's story raises profound questions about American foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing evidence about one man's role in a long history of human rights abuses leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens of international standards of justice.</p>
<p>The film focuses on Henry Kissinger and his role in America's secret bombing of Cambodia in 1969, the approval of Indonesia's genocidal assault on East Timor in 1975, the assassination of a Chilean general in 1970, and his involvement in the 1969 Paris peace talks concerning the Vietnam Conflict.</p>
<p>A film about the war crimes of the American diplomat, Henry Kissinger.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am not a fan of Kissinger & I'm sure he has done quite a many disreputable things. However this is so one-sided that it shouldn't be called a documentary at all. A lot of this is interesting but how much is truth? This does nothing but say how horrible the man is & all the bad things he has done especially during the Vietnam War. The one thing that is for sure is that Kissinger didn't seem to have any sort of scruples or loyalty towards anyone but himself. I'm not sure if that is good or bad, but as far as his Foreign Policy issues are concerned, he would do whatever he had to or follow whoever he thought would win an election so he could stay in power. This is mildly interesting but again you only get one side. Everyone attacks him & it seems no one stands up for him at all. I must say that his wiretapping of his own people is quite unforgivable no matter who you are. He reminds me a lot of J. Edgar Hoover & I bet he had all sorts of blackmailing files just like Hoover did which is probably part of the reason he was so powerful. If you attacked him, well he could really hurt you.</p>
