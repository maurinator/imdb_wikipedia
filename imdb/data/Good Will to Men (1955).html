<h1>Good Will to Men (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of young mice is in the ruins of a church, practicing singing for an upcoming service. After singing an adulterated version of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," the mice wonder about the last line, "Good will to men." One of them asks the chorus master, an old mouse, "What are men?" The old mouse explains that they all killed each other off by building bigger and more destructive weapons, first guns, then missiles, then bombs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A remake of 'Peace on Earth', a parable of mice, men, and the futility of war, 'Good Will To Men' starts with a mouse choir singing for Christmas. The word 'men' appears in the carol, and the mice start asking questions about what men were.Slowly we realise that men destroyed themselves and all their towns and cities by wars, bombs, and guns. We see footage of men crawling across trenches and fields, setting off machine guns, dropping mushroom bombs on cities.Finally the cartoon returns to the mice, frightened but wise in their ruined church, with the wise old owl poring over the Bible, a 'good book of rules'.Well-drawn and tightly-plotted, this cartoon was a worthy Oscar nominee and is still effective after all these years.</p>
