<h1>The Adjuster (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A reflection about what makes everyone's life unique, through the story of Noah's family. Noah is an adjuster, having sex with his customers. His wife Hera watches pornographic movies for the Board of Censors. They live with their son Simon and Hera's sister in a show-flat. One day, they meet Bubba, who wants to make a movie in their house.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Agree with the previous post.. this film is extraordinary and I'm amazed at the negative reactions here. I would rate it as my favourite film of all..It's an incredible and subtle meditation on what means to be alive, to be human, to love. To be human and to be confronted by this fragmented, alienating, disturbing modern existence .. with our lives and interactions largely filtered through technology and our experiences so far removed from those of our ancestors and those before.I was provoked and amazed by this piece of work - and I'd urge anyone who wants to be challenged to see it.James</p>
