<h1>New Waterford Girl (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's sometime in the 1970's. Fifteen year old loner Agnes Marie Pottie - nicknamed Mooney - dreams of escaping life in New Waterford, a coastal Nova Scotia town on Cape Breton Island. She has quiet contempt for most of the people around her - including her large family - who don't share her sensibilities. They, who are ruled by Catholic mores, in turn think she's unconventional and weird. She thinks she's realized her dream when, with the help of her teacher Cecil Sweeney, who himself has escaped to New Waterford to find himself (at which he has been unsuccessful so far), she has been awarded a scholarship to attend an art school in New York. Her dreams are temporarily dashed when her parents don't allow her to go. She devises a plan to get out of New Waterford, one that goes against her loner status. In the meantime, a bit of New York comes to New Waterford in the form of Lou Benzoa, who, with her dance instructor mother, has temporarily moved next door to the Pottie's to escape life in the Bronx until "the stink dies down". Lou, who becomes friends with Mooney, quickly gains the reputation in town as the female equalizer, whose powers only work on the guilty.</p>
<p>A gifted teenager, dreaming of life beyond her small town, becomes inspired when a 15-year-old girl from New York moves in next door.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Funny, hip, and full of fresh faces. Crisp direction, and a quirky script that never lets you down. Some of the jokes may baffle you non-Canucks, but be brave and try a taste of  our true national culture.Proves once again that there's more to Atlantic Canadian  film than "Anne of Green Gables".</p>
