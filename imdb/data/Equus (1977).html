<h1>Equus (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A psychiatrist, Martin Dysart, investigates the savage blinding of six horses with a metal spike in a stable in Hampshire, England. The atrocity was committed by an unassuming seventeen-year-old stable boy named Alan Strang, the only son of an opinionated but inwardly-timid father and a genteel, religious mother. As Dysart exposes the truths behind the boy's demons, he finds himself face-to-face with his own.</p>
<p>Despite being already overworked, Dr. Martin Dysart, head of a psychiatric hospital, agrees to the request of his friend, Magistrate Hesther Saloman, personally to work on the case of seventeen year old Alan Strang, charged with blinding six horses with a metal spike at the stables where he worked one day a week as a stable boy. The blindings are despite Alan supposedly having had an affinity with horses since he was a child and his first exposure to a horse at age six. Alan will be housed at the hospital, where Martin will have a daily session with him until he gets back to Hesther with his professional findings, with the hopeful end goal being for Alan to return to being a "normal" boy. For background, Martin wants to speak to among others: Alan's parents, Frank and Dora Strang, working class Frank who believes the event had something to do with religion and pious Dora's regular bible readings to Alan; Harry Dalton, the angry stable owner who nonetheless admits Alan was a model employee up until the incident; and Jill Mason, the young woman Alan met at the stable, she who got him the job. Initially in Martin and Alan's sessions, Alan wants to portray himself as being crazy by singing commercial jingles when asked anything. Although not without incidents along the way, Alan does begin to open up about himself in their sessions. What happens between Martin and Alan is affected by and affects Martin personally: his thoughts about his profession and his somewhat cold and childless marriage to his dentist wife, Margaret.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the most intriguing comments I've heard about this film is that it pales in comparison to the stage production.  On the one hand, this is true in that the film loses much of the inventive staging that was inherent in the play (e.g., convention of having the "horses" played by actors in black with horsehead headdresses, the tight focus of the action within a small perimeter).  The problem, however, isn't so much Sidney Lumet's concept of the film as it is the limitations of the medium itself -- devices which are striking on stage simply don't work on film.  Indeed, those directors who have tried to make such conventions work usually end up shortchanging the material.And it is here where Lumet's genius comes in.  If there is one thing that Lumet has a feel for, it is the gritty, down-to-earth feel of everyday life.  While this usually means New York life, he does a marvelous job in this film of capturing the drab sterility of Dysart's world, as well as that of the Strang home.  When these are compared to the vivid, almost ethereal shots of Alan in the stables or with the horses on the field (also, compare the striking image of horse and rider on the beach with the remainder of the beachgoers), we can fully understand Dysart's frustration about "looking at pages of centaurs trampling the soil of Argos" while Alan "is trying to become one in a Hampshire field".  Alan has found a way to completely escape the drabness of his world, while Dysart has become sterile trying to find ways not remind himself of it.  Similarly, the tight perimeter of the stage play has been replaced by tight focused shots which, more often than not, achieve the same result through a claustrophobic effect.Likewise, the absence of theatrical staging does nothing to dampen the power of Shaffer's text, which remains as potent as ever.  Indeed, what's often overlooked about this play is that, while the visual images of the staging are striking, they are, in most instances, completely detached from the central thrust of the text, both as a mystery and as a commentary on the consequences of society's demand for "normality" at any cost.In this regard, the performances are outstanding.  Richard Burton gives one of his last great performances as Dysart, showing us the literally crumbling facade of the doctor's spirit, while at the same time giving us a complete character (contrast his cynicism throughout with the moments of tenderness, such as those shown to Alan's mother and to Alan himself after the final session).  Likewise, Peter Firth presents us with a cipher, wrapped up in television jingles, who is revealed to us piece by piece through moments of vulnerability until we see in full force what has made his character commit these horrible crimes.  The rest of the cast -- notably Joan Plowright, Colin Blakely and Jenny Agutter -- do wonders with the limited dialogue they have to work with.Put simply, Equus is an astonishing film to watch, provided that you're ready to watch it as a film, rather than as a filmed stage play.  For those who hold to the notion that only the stage devices can make this play work, I'd advise them not to watch any film adapted from a play, as they'll almost certainly be disappointed every time.</p>
