<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>if this movie isn't a 10, then there isn't a 10 anywhere. jackie gleason plays this character so beautifully, juxtaposed against the ruthless street-walking mother of the sweet young nicole. also the settings show a dichotomy of character with his poor-man surroundings, and the rich-man place he takes himself to........all the impress collette so that he can spend time with young nicole.gleason was nominated for an academy award for his portrayal of gigot, but was lost in a very strong cadre of contenders.does anyone know why this film has not been released on VHS or DVD? certainly it would sell. this film is a keeper. i watch hundreds of movies but refuse to buy only the absolute best. wish i could buy gigot.</p>
