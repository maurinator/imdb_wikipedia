<h1>The Seventh Sign (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Haiti, the sea and the life-form die; in the Middle East, a town is frozen. These are signs of the Apocalypse and the Vatican is investigating, but Father Lucci advises that these omens are hoax or technologically explained. In California, the housewife Abby Quinn is pregnant and the delivery is scheduled to February, 29 in a leap year. Her husband, the lawyer Russell Quinn, is defending a weird case of the teenager Jimmy Szaragosa that killed his parents telling that he was following the Word of God. Meanwhile Abby rents a garage apartment to the mysterious David Bannon. The hopeless Abby has strange nightmares and soon she finds that around the world there are signs of the Apocalypse in accordance with the Book of Revelation. She learns also that David Bannon is Jesus that has returned; Father Lucci is the Pilate's porter Cartaphilus that was doomed to wander on Earth for the eternity; and she is a woman that tried to help Jesus. Further, she is the Seventh Sign and the Apocalypse will happen when her baby is stillborn. What can she do to save her unborn son and mankind?</p>
<p>Russell Quinn, a criminal defense counsel and his emotionally fragile wife, Abby, are anxiously awaiting childbirth; Abby has vivid, haunting dreams. Disasters begin to occur around the world; some call it "end of days." Abbey feels called upon to stop the sixth disaster but she is too late. As the final disaster looms, will Abbey have hope sufficient to save mankind?</p>
<p>Around the world, the signs of the apocalypse--as outlined in the Book of Revelation--seem to be coming to pass in the wake of a mysterious wanderer. Father Lucci, the Vatican Emissary assigned to investigate, dismisses the occurrences as natural, but Abby Quinn, a young American woman, has reason to fear they're real--and that the unfolding events may spell disaster for her unborn child.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first scene in the film is a super one. In the middle of a small Haitian village, through the impenetrable crowds of people, walks a man who is clearly out of place with everything else. He walks toward the sea and stops before a beach. In his hands he holds a scroll and a seal. He breaks the seal, drops it on the surf, and walks away, leaving a small boy to watch as the sea begins to boil and the fish wash up on the shore. It is clear what is happening: the first sign of the apocalypse.Thus begins "The Seventh Sign", a supernatural thriller that only partially works, and should be better than it is. Demi Moore is a pregnant woman who begins to believe that the boarder in the apartment next door may have some bizarre, end-of-the-world plans for her baby. The boarder is the aforementioned stranger with the seal, as played menacingly by Jurgen Prochnow. The strength of this film is the sense of impending doom that pervades throughout. The film is stylish, and very effective in managing an apocalyptic tone.The main flaw of the movie, however, is that the supporting characters are so much more interesting than the featured couple. Prochnow's boarder is very creepy, and we realize that this man means business (although his role and his motives are never really made clear). The Father Lucci character is a fascinating one, and when we hear of his true identity, we are further gripped, although at the end he is made into a routine maniacal villain, and his fate is never told. This movie might have worked better if the Moore character were not so bland. She is put forth as a woman destined to save the world, yet she comes across as a talking head who is endlessly impressed by Prochnow's cryptic stories. She never really comes across as anything interesting. Her husband is the typical disbelieving clod who refuses to accept what his wife is saying, even when all hell is breaking loose around their ears. Despite the flaws, I enjoyed "The Seventh Sign" and would willingly watch it again. There are several powerful moments, and other scenes that are memorable, like the opening shot. I would recommend it, but I'm not sure if I'd do so as a serious movie or as silly weekend fare.</p>
