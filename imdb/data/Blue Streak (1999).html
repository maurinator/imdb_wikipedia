<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie really delivers in the laughter department and succeeds as a vehicle for star Martin Lawrence. In the film, Lawrence plays a thief who steals a diamond and manages to hide it in a building structure before being caught and sent to prison for two years. Upon his release, he finds that the building is now a police station, and he has to impersonate a cop to get in and claim his prize. That is where the real fun stuff begins.*** out of ****</p>
