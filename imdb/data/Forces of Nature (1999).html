<h1>Forces of Nature (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ben Holmes, a professional book-jacket blurbologist, is trying to get to Savannah for his wedding. He just barely catches the last plane, but a seagull flies into the engine as the plane is taking off. All later flights are cancelled because of an approaching hurricane, so he is forced to hitch a ride in a Geo Metro with an attractive but eccentric woman named Sarah.</p>
<p>Ben Holmes, a pretty regular guy, is on his way to his wedding. A little accident hinders the takeoff, and soon Ben finds himself in a third person's rental car together with eccentric but attractive Sarah. Several catastrophic incidents later, the two are thought to be a married couple and run into Ben's best friend and his girlfriend, who happens to be the bride's best friend. Now, Ben and Sarah have to face the problem that they really might be made for each other, but they also might just be panicking about the upcoming events: His marriage and her first meeting with a special person.</p>
<p>A soon-to-be-married man encounters an exciting stranger after his plane suffers an accident on takeoff.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I read the user comments and was reluctant to view this movie. Well I'm sure glad I went against the crowd. This is a good movie! What more could you ask for. (Sandy is great) The scene I adored is when Sarah is beckoning Ben to come and dance. If a women ever did that to me I would run to her. I really enjoyed the ending but I won't discuss that. There were enough laughs to keep it lite and enjoyable. The gay bar was a real hoot. Ben did a superb acting job doing his dance all be it Sandy does'st hurt the eyes. The one thing I liked is this movie is not a tear jerker. Most of Sandy's movies have me shedding tears like a water works. The story line surely shows that people live their lives in very different ways and that gives the movie credence. What's to not like? Easy to follow has Sandy in it what more could you want? One criticism, what did they use to put on sandy's eye makeup on a putty knife?</p>
