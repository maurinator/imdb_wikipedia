<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You can love everything about this film, no matter how cheap and shoddy it is. This is one of my favorites, with Godzilla battling his robot clone, with the help of King Seesar. The robot clone is being controlled by apes from the planet of the apes, or in otherwords, outer space. Angillus is also in this, and it turns into one big ol' battle for survival. There are a few different versions of this film, and I have seen it under all the titles, but the one for me that is most memorable is the version put out by UAV. It was under the title "Godzilla vs. The Cosmic Monster" but the film print is dark, and there is no opening credits, just a title card after the mountain explodes. It also has some film scratches, but we won't worry about those. Sometimes the picture is hard to see also. I don't know why I remember that one, probably because it's so different from all the other prints, but no matter how you see the film, it is undoubtedly cool.</p>
