<h1>Son of Sinbad (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sinbad was pursuing a secret weapon: Greek Fire. Attributed to the ancient Greeks, it was composed of pitch or bitumen, sulfur, and other ingredients. It was used in naval warfare and the Romans also made use of it but with the fall of the ancient Western world, it was temporarily forgotten, but it was rediscovered by the Arabs from whom European Crusaders also learned the method of making it.</p>
<p>This is a 1953 film originally shot in 3-D that, like usual for films that involved Howard Hughes, was finally released nearly two full years after its initial trade showings and the 3-D craze was long past. Primary problem was, much like "The French Line," getting PCA approval as, also like "The French Line," the female costumes left little unshown and unexploited. Pity. Sally Forrest and Mari Blanchard were made for 3-D. The Son of Sinbad and his buddy Omar are thrown in prison for visiting the harem of the Kalif once too often. Meanwhile the Kalif learns that Tammerlane the Cruel is planning to destroy his city if he doesn't surrender it. But with the aid of some early-day gunpowder, Sinbad and Omar save the day, aided by their 40-girl brigade that are all daughters of the original Forty Thieves... and all girl with a capital G.</p>
<p>Legendary pirate and adventurer Sinbad is in single-minded pursuit of two things: beautiful women and a substance called Greek Fire--an early version of gunpowder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Back when I first saw this, I was enchanted by the verses of Omar Khayyam (which I innocently supposed to be have been created for the script), excited by the spectacle, delighted to recognise allusions to so many familiar stories rolled into one, and heartily entertained by the comedy. Watching it again nowadays, I can't help noticing how the picture is completely dominated by the producer's desire to feature as many half-naked girls as can conceivably be shovelled into its slender plot.Thanks to the engaging double-act of the two male leads (Vincent Price as Omar still steals the show) the film remains a watchable romp, but the extended dancing sequences threaten to wreck the otherwise brisk pacing. I suspect they either pall or enthral, according to taste. Where other "Sinbad" films will show you a few seconds of exotic dance as an establishing shot, this one lovingly retains the camera throughout the whole routine -- or several! The heavy mining from other sources of legend -- whether the secret of Greek Fire (nowadays assumed to have been napalm), the conqueror Tamerlaine, the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, or well-known lines from the Rubaiyat -- also now tends to suggest a certain laziness in the writing of the script, rather than inspiring a delighted recognition of familiar allusions. I'm afraid I'm probably too sophisticated these days to be able to enjoy "Son of Sinbad" whole-heartedly any longer... which in a way is a shame. It's still a lively adventure with a saving sense of the absurd and an unabashed penchant for spectacle, but I can't in all honesty rank it above the rest.</p>
