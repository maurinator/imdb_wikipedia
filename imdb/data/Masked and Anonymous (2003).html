<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are intelligent enough to pick up on the satire, the political commentary, and if you can understand the depth of this film, you will realize this will be something shown in art classes for years to come. This movie isn't the average movie goes "sit down and zone out" film. This movie is filled with metaphors and commentary about the directions governments and people are heading in - sacrificing their lives for causes they know little about. If you dig Orwell and A. Huxley, this is a film for you. The characters in this movie, apart from Dylan, are all very audacious and fake. Many of them depict and reflect the times in which the movie is set - times of fear, times of survival by any means, and times where artistic achievement is ignored in favor of safety and comfort. Art has never been safe and comfortable - art is about risk and challenge. This movie displays this. Dylan's character is like the eye of the storm - calm and collected because he sees through the lies and deceit. He knows that his whole role in the movie is just to appease some political cause, and he won't compromise his vision and ideals for anyone - even if they are holding a gun to his head.</p>
