<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great aussie thriller though hard to find now on video to hire or buy and not been screened on aussie tv for some time now. Based on a true story surrounding the dissapearance of juanita nielson,this movie shot in and around sydney received mixed reviews despite the talented cast led perfectly by the gorgeous elizabeth alexander.This movie is worth watching over and over again just to look at elizabeth.A truely talented Australian actress whose talents seemed to be wasted and never reached the success her acting talents deserved. For those who like aussie movies this is a must and proves aussie filmmakers were turning out high quality dramas/thrillers long before the likes of "muriel's wedding" and "prescilla queen of the dessert"(2 fine aussie comedies)were even thought of. Ending of this movie was a little dissapointing but is thought provoking as it leaves the viewer with many unawnsered questions on the real dissapearance of juanita nielson. I rate this an 8 out of 10.</p>
