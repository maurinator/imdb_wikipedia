<h1>Topper (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This series was about a somewhat grumpy and uptight banker, Cosmo Topper, and the ghosts which only he could see or hear, George and Marion Kerby. The Kerbys would often try to get Cosmo to loosen up and enjoy life, but more often they would complicate it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember well watching reruns of this series in the Fifties; incredibly, it still shows up in late-night reruns on broadcast TV even today. The special effects were pretty good for 1953, and now they're merely quaint. But the pleasant and good-natured charm of this story about the stodgy banker and the two friendly ghosts of the young marrieds who used to live in his house and were killed by an avalanche is just wonderful. The ghosts alternately help and drive crazy Topper - but they mean well. The chemistry is excellent, helped by Sterling and Jeffreys being married. Anne Jeffreys turned up in the last few years on some shows. . . and must have been drinking a youth serum! Still lovely.</p>
