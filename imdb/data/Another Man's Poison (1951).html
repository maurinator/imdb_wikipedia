<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another in a long line of Davis' deliciously evil roles. This film has the same feel as "The Little Foxes", but with a bit more scenery chewing. I was a little puzzled as to some of the plot developments, but on the whole such things don't mean much when you're watching Davis and Merrill try to outmaneuver each other.I didn't care much for the rest of the cast, but what does it matter? Davis makes it a very satisfying experience.</p>
