<h1>Running Brave (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of Billy Mills, the American Indian that came from obscurity, to win the 10,000 meter long distance foot race in the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"For world-class distance runner Billy Mills, the toughest competition often began when he stepped off the track. From life on an impoverished South Dakota Indian reservation to his phenomenal upset victory at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Mills constantly challenged the barriers of culture and his own deeply-rooted insecurities. Robby Benson stars in this true, uniquely uplifting story of an extraordinary quest for personal excellence," according to the 1983 "Englander Productions" VHS videocassette. "Running Brave" originally ran with some salty language and included a shower scene with some fleeting frontal nudity (honestly, there is nothing to crow about). The 2004 "Trinity" DVD has reportedly shaved off the pubic hair and incorrectly cites the same running time. Some mild vulgarities may have also been excised (strongest expletive used herein is the word for human feces). The slightly above average film is based on a true story about an athlete overcoming much to participate in the climactic big event.****** Running Brave (11/4/83) D.S.
