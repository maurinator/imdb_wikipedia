<h1>Ice Castles (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young girl is on top of the world until a tragic accident dashes her hopes and dreams of becoming a world-class figure skater. Only with the help of those who love her can she prove to the world -- and herself -- that she still has the potential to realize her dreams.</p>
<p>Alexis Winston (Lynn-Holly Johnson) is a young girl who dreams of becoming a champion figure skater. One night, while practicing, Alexis suffers a terrible accident that takes her sight and threatens to destroy her dreams. In the midst of feeling sorry for herself she falls in love with a handsome young man named Nick (Robbie Benson) who (with help from her family) helps her to realize that she can still fulfill her dreams.</p>
<p>Sixteen year old Lexie Winston, from the small town of Waverley, Iowa, is a gifted figure skater who does it because she loves it. She is coached locally by her friend Beulah Smith, the proprietress of the local run down bowling alley combination ice rink. Beulah was a regional champion in her own figure skating days twenty years ago, she who realizes that she can only teach Lexie so much compared to world class coaches. Believing Lexie has what it takes, Beulah tries to convince Lexie's widowed father, Marcus Winston, to allow Lexie to skate competitively for the first time at the Upper Great Lakes regionals. Marcus, who has always resisted getting Lexie into competitive skating because of the pressures and what he considers the unrealistic expectations, reluctantly agrees. At the regionals, Lexie catches the eye of world class coach Deborah Machland, who wants to train Lexie and believes Lexie can win at the Olympics in three years despite her lack of formal training up to this point and Lexie's advanced age. Lexie also catches the eye of Brian Dockett, a sports reporter, who is not only doing an extended piece on her expected speedy trajectory to the top of the figure skating world but who has a romantic interest in her. As Lexie gets thrown into the cutthroat world of competitive skating, which includes narrow minded judges who have a preconceived notion of who should win, intimidation tactics by and against other skaters, and coaches who have a win at all cost mentality, she also gets caught up in the fame and adulation. Her long time boyfriend, Nick Peterson, who is going through his own crisis of identity, feels like he is losing her, both figuratively and literally, to this new world. But when her figure skating life is in jeopardy, Lexie has to muster up the courage to decide what to do regardless of the obstacles. In the process, she finds out who her true supports in life are.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Most will either love Ice Castles or hate it. Perhaps hate is a little harsh but it gets the point across. For a film with numerous shortcomings it has achieved somewhat of a cult following. So much so that Columbia Tristar decided to release it in DVD format several years ago.What's wrong with the movie? For a film partially intended to appeal to the teenage crowd, it is unnecessary to have any foul language. Yet Ice Castles is sprinkled with four letter words from the beginning to the end. It doesn't advance the plot one iota and it's inclusion in the film is a mystery. Perhaps the producer thought a "G" rating would doom it at the box office and added the harsh language to get a "PG". Whatever the reason it degrades the film.Many of the lines the actors speak seem to be more or less mumbled and hard to understand. Not sure if this is a sound problem or simply bad acting.There is a severe lack of continuity in some scenes. For instance Lexie is first wearing a green jacket in the segment where she is learning to skate on the pond after becoming blind. Suddenly she is wearing a blue jacket in the next scene and just as suddenly goes back to the green jacket! Not to mention her being bare-headed and then is seen wearing a beige hat and then back to being bare-headed again! The producer must have been blind too!!The original film was 115 minutes according to a New York Times review in 1979. However, the VHS and DVD versions are about 108 minutes. Where are the missing 7 minutes and why were they not included?Nevertheless, despite these and other faults, the film works due in large part to Marvin Hamlisch's stirring music and Lynn-Holly Johnson's beautiful skating. It is a three-hankie the first time you see it and has inspired many young hopefuls to take up the sport. A must-see if you like films that turn tragedy into victory.</p>
