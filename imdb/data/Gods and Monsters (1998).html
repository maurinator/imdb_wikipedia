<h1>Gods and Monsters (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of James Whale, the director of Frankenstein (1931) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), in the time period following the Korean War. Whale is homosexual and develops a friendship with his gardener, an ex-Marine.</p>
<p>Set in 1957, James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936), _Invisible Man, The (1933)_, Frankenstein (1931), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), had long since stepped back from the glamor and glitz of Hollywood. A stroke triggers once buried flashes of memory of his life in Dudley, his film career, and, most influentially, the trenches during the Great War. Haunted and lonely, he recounts many of his experiences to his musclebound gardener, Clay Boone. Despite the divide that exists between them, their friendship develops. Reliant on his sternly disapproving housemaid, Hannah, the flamboyant director whose time has passed sees himself slipping away, unable to stop the decline, and indulges his fantasies by coaxing Boone to model for him.</p>
<p>The last days of Frankenstein (1931) director James Whale are explored.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I resisted seeing this film at first, but agreed to see it at a second run house with a group of people.  At the film's conclusion, I found that I liked it much more than any other person I went with.  I found "Gods and Monsters" to be a thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive-yet-harsh study of later life and the reflections one experiences as death approaches.  I was also very pleased to see the film draw Whale's Great War experiences into focus (although in less detail than I would have liked), and make them the central point to his life and career, and, as he is dying, his misery.  The rather exquisitely torturous method of his wasting lends veracity to his ultimate actions.  The film is also an excellent rumination on the vagaries of fame, artistic or professional control of one's work, and the value of work.  Whale also bitterly recalls his youth and the feeling of being trapped in the English caste system in several scenes during a prior "family values" generation.The film is well-filmed but slow in spots, contains some cliches or scenes that are too "easy", but is highly rewarding, and is  driven by excellent performances from Redgrave and McKellan and, to a lesser extent, Fraser. The film's final scene is great, too.  I eagerly awaited the premiere of "The Thin Red Line", and having seen it, I would say that this film addresses the issues of individual humanity, social decay, and the horror of war much better.  This film should be an Oscar sleeper.  8* out of 10*.</p>
