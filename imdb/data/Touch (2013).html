<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well the movie does have an alluring poster / cover, but as the saying goes; don't judge a book by its cover. As was the truth with this movie as well.The movie started out at a tremendous pace, and promised to be really interesting, especially if it could manage to uphold that level of intensity and interest. Unfortunately, it couldn't. The movie got winded and lost breath half way through, slowing down in pace tremendously, but still, it had potential. Perhaps the middle part of the movie was just building up to another intense part towards the end. That was not to be, sadly. And the movie shattered into fragments of ridiculous storytelling once the story took the audience to Maud's house, from thereon the movie just spiraled and got worse.I will say that the mood in "Dark Touch" is really good, it is dark, brooding and gloomy, and have all the right ingredients for a true horror movie. And it was well on the way, if it wasn't because of the storyline that lost breath halfway through and ran on an fumes towards the end.The acting in "Dark Touch" was quite good, and the lead role played by Missy Keating was quite well-played. A rather good performance by such a young actress. Perhaps she is one that will carve a name for herself in the movie business in the years to come?It was a shame that the movie failed to uphold the intensity and spooky atmosphere that it started out with. "Dark Touch" really had potential, it just went in a very wrong direction.</p>
