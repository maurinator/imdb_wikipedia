<h1>Storytelling (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Storytelling is comprised of two separate stories set against the sadly comical terrain of college and high school, past and present. Following the paths of its young hopeful/ troubled characters, it explores issues of sex, race, celebrity and exploitation</p>
<p>Storytelling follows two separate, unrelated stories of the angst, frustration, depression of the youth of today against two backdrops. In "Fiction", Vi is a hip college teenager who allows herself to be exploited and abused by any guy, including her writing professor, in order to get inspiration for her creative writing class. In "Non-fiction", Toby Oxman is a hapless loser/shoe salesman who wants to be a famous documentary filmmaker. For his first project, Toby explores the dysfunctional Livingston family, focusing mostly on the oldest son Scooby, an alienated, hates-the-world, ticking-time-bomb, bisexual, high school student with dreams of being famous.</p>
<p>College and high school serve as the backdrop for two stories about dysfunction and personal turmoil.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not the best work from this director, but not as bad as many people seem to think. 'Fiction,' while unpleasant, is Solondz in fine, chilly form. He gets criticized a lot for showing contempt for his characters, but his movies are more than the simplistic revenge fantasies they get written off as. When he's on, there's something really beautiful about his dry, clear vision: he's truly appalled, even frightened, by his characters and their hypocrisies. 'Fiction' is a toxic little parable about what's wrong with the processes of both making and interpreting art, and Selma Blair's performance is quite surprising and good. But 'Nonfiction' misfires. It, too, contains some brilliant insights about making art (and personally, I wasn't bothered by the navel-gazing), but they're spread quite thin, and the narrative itself meanders, never really finding its rhythm. (In other words, the storytelling itself is its worst weakness.) Paul Giamatti is typically good, but he doesn't always have much to work with. Overall, 'Storytelling' is too uneven to get very enthusiastic about; then again, it's more interesting than much else out there. 6 out of 10.</p>
