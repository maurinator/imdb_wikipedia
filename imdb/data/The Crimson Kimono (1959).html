<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Caught this late one night on a cable station, and went out of my way to watch it a second time sober. Then watched part of it again just to be sure I liked as much as I thought I did. What surprised me more than anything was how the movie portrayed Asian-Americans during a time period when they were usually marginalized or ignored in other movies. This film also subtly mocks the prevalent stereo-type of the standard studly handsome action-hero. OK. Not really so subtle, but still enjoyable without being too horribly trite. All that combined with a rather scrumcious detective plot makes this a mystery movie definitely worth tracking down and watching. Had this movie been done in the late 90s as a small, indie film, it probably would have done extremely well. At least 30 years ahead of its time.</p>
