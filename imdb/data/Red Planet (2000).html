<h1>Red Planet (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the near future, Earth is dying. A new colony on Mars could be humanity's only hope. A team of American astronauts, each a specialist in a different field, is making the first manned expedition to the red planet and must struggle to overcome the differences in their personalities, backgrounds and ideologies for the overall good of the mission. When their equipment suffers life-threatening damage and the crew must depend on one another for survival on the hostile surface of Mars, their doubts, fears and questions about God, man's destiny and the nature of the universe become defining elements in their fates. In this alien environment they must come face to face with their most human selves.</p>
<p>In 2055, earth is no longer viable enough for food production. A promising algae experiment on Mars runs into trouble, so a small Air Force-civilian scientific-technician team travels there. The emergency landing is a nearly-fatal disaster: provisions losses and equipment threaten both survival and return capacity. Even AMEE, a navigation drone, is accidentally switched into its dangerous military mode. As if that weren't bad enough, errors, suspicions and emotions like guilt make the men on mars an woman on watch in the ship behave erratically. Yet some startling discoveries and Robby Gallagher's inventiveness rekindle hope, at least for earth.</p>
<p>Astronauts, and their robotic dog AMEE (Autonomous Mapping Evaluation and Evasion), search for solutions to save a dying Earth by searching on Mars, only to have the mission go terribly awry.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are worse ways to spend 100 minutes.  Val Kilmer was lots of fun, Carrie-Ann Moss actually CAN act, and the screen-writers actually had HALF a brain.  Okay, so they ignored the whole gravity thing, but at least that had a reason why the characters didn't run out of air.  It wasn't a great reason, but at least it was a reason.It plays like some mediocre sci-fi story that might have been written in the 1950's.  And next to the indescribably awful "Mission to Mars," this movie is Citizen Kane.  Screenwriter Chuck Pfarrer isn't too incredibly original, but director Antony Hoffman put it together pretty decently.  An A for effort, but the movie is only a 6 or 7 out of 10, depending on how YOU feel about the actors.Unlike, say, "Mission to Mars," which had a great cast working from a script written by drunken chimapanzees.</p>
