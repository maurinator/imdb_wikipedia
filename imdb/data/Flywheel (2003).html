<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Refreshing non-Hollywood style drama. It was obviously made on a shoe-string budget by relative unknowns, but that's part of this sweet little film's charm. It is a fine example of a thoughtful effort to get a point across without explosions, car chases, or four-letter slang.The writer and lead Alex Kendrick has offered up a very sincere and cleverly told story. It's not polished; its independent roots are evident (tops of people's heads get chopped off a lot, for example). Nevertheless, the characters are likable and the acting isn't bad at all. The writer puts a lot of humorous one-liners in the script ("You lazy, fat, last-chip-eating thief!"), and the story rolls along nicely. Used car salesman Jay Austin makes a perfect modern Ebenezer Scrooge type, a dishonest and ruthless businessman. His life (both business and private) starts crashing down, and he cries out to God for forgiveness and help. His revival seems rushed in the story, but it's believable. But it's not just his personal epiphany and the changing of his ways that this story focuses on, it's the result of that change. The dishonest employees of Austin who do not change, make a great counterpoint between his past and present behavior. A couple of plot twists near the end can be seen coming from a mile away, but that doesn't really hurt the film.Certainly there's a moral, and the movie succeeds at presenting food for thought. It makes for a good rental.</p>
