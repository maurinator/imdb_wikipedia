<h1>The Big Heat (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dave Bannion is an upright cop on the trail of a vicious gang he suspects holds power over the police force. Bannion is tipped off after a colleague's suicide and his fellow officers' suspicious silence lead him to believe that they are on the gangsters' payroll. When a bomb meant for him kills his wife instead, Bannion becomes a furious force of vengeance and justice, aided along the way by the gangster's spurned girlfriend Debbie. As Bannion and Debbie fall further and further into the Gangland's insidious and brutal trap, they must use any means necessary (including murder) to get to the truth.</p>
<p>Homicide bureau Det. Sgt. Dave Banion is assigned to the case when a policeman, Tom Duncan who was head of the records bureau, commits suicide. It seems like an open and shut case until the police get a call from Lucy Chapman. She says she was Tom's girlfriend and there is no way he would have committed suicide. Banion dismisses her story out of hand but when Chapman is found the next day, beaten and tortured to death, he begins to think there may be something to what she said. Despite warnings to back off, Bannion continues investigating but it leads to his wife's death. He quits the force and pursues mobster Mike Lagana and his henchman Vince Stone.</p>
<p>Detective Dave Bannion investigates a police sergeant's suicide. Strictly routine...until a B-girl claiming to have evidence is found murdered, and Bannion's superiors order him off the case. Not one to suffer being pushed, Bannion pushes back at reputed mob boss Lagana, who fanatically keeps his home life free of "dirt." Result: a bomb meant for Bannion kills HIS WIFE, and Bannion becomes a white-hot sword of vengeance, alone against a corrupt world...except for Debby, disfigured ex-mistress of sadistic mobster Vince Stone.</p>
<p>Tough cop Dave Bannion takes on a politically powerful crime syndicate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A violent story about a detective working in a corrupt department who investigates the apparent suicide of a fellow officer. Worth seeing for Glenn Ford's prototypical performance and Gloria Grahme's show stealing portrayal of a boozing moll with a conscience. With facial disfigurement and cigarette burns it took violence up a notch from the standard gun play of the past, making it grimmer and more realistic, and giving the story more punch. Grahme's tough and tender role stands out and gives the film a tragic element, while certain of its portrayals of greed and corruption (namely the dead officer's wife) stand out for their attention to detail. In the end, it IS the details that give this formulaic story its clout, and we can thank director Fritz Lang for that.</p>
