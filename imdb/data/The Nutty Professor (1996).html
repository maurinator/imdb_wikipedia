<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>*** 1/2Starring: Eddie Murphy (x 7), Jada Pinkett Smith, and Larry Miller.An obese college professor starts to fall for a pretty teacher.  He doesn't think that people will like him if he was fat, so he uses a weight-losing potion he created on himself.  It works perfectly, and the professor is extremely thin.  Now, people treat him differently than when he was fat.  But he soon finds out that the "thin" side of him has a mind of its own and is looking to get rid of the "plump" side forever.Murphy does excellent in all seven roles that are given to him.  The scene(s) that really make it funny are the dinner ones.  I will say that on a low note, Buddy is a little over the top.I highly recommend it.</p>
