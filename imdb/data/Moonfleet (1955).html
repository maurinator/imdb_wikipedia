<h1>Moonfleet (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Somewhere in the 18th century Great Britain, noble but penniless young boy John Mohune is sent by his dying mother to Moonfleet, to put himself under the protection of a certain Jeremy Fox. The boy discovers that Fox is both a former lover of his mother and the leader of a gang of buccaneers. A strange friendship grows as their adventures go on.</p>
<p>1757 Dorsetshire. In the rugged coastal area of Moonfleet, smuggling has become rampant, the royal military forces who are trying to capture and punish any smugglers by execution. Jeremy Fox, a gentleman with a bit of a roguish side, is one such smuggler unknown to the military, he who leads a ragtag band who he organized into a more effective group in their work, and thus he who reaps the lion's share of the rewards. Some in the area do suspect him of certain activities, such as crooked Lord and Lady Ashwood, who want him to join them in a life a piracy against foreign fleets. His life is turned upside down with the arrival of a young adolescent orphaned boy, John Mohune. Before her death, John's mother, Olivia Mohune, told John to look for Jeremy in Moonfleet, Olivia's family who lived in the house where Jeremy currently resides, but Olivia who died in relative poverty. Olivia told John that Jeremy would take care of him. As such, John, who has no idea of who Jeremy actually is, sees him as an unconditional friend. Indeed, Olivia and Jeremy do have a turbulent past, with Jeremy sporting the physical and emotional scars of their history. Jeremy wants no responsibility for John, preferring he be sent away somewhere without his influence. Wanting no responsibility and keeping John safe are two different issues for Jeremy, John who doesn't want to go and whose life is in increasing danger based on Jeremy's work and what he begins to find out about it. Thrown into the mix of what happens is a long lost diamond of the Mohune's which is probably located somewhere within Moonfleet.</p>
<p>Moonfleet is set in Dorset, England. The Fleet refers to the land just west of Portland, Southern England.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Young John Mohune comes to Dorset to meet a man called Jeremy Fox who he believes was a friend of his late mother and will help look after him. Expecting a friend in Fox, John is upset to find an uncaring man who has no interest in John. He persists though in trying to gain the friendship and attention of Fox even in the face of great dissuasion. All Fox's acquaintances are rather desperate men, which fly in the face of his rather "proper" appearance. John doesn't suspect anything, being a child, but the area is famous for smugglers and Fox may be connected and perhaps be more dangerous than anyone realises  not least the innocent John Mohune.I watched this film simply because I was a bit taken aback by the fact that it was a Fritz Lang film. Not being a name I would have associated with a period film I decided to take a look and see what he did with it. In fairness Falkner's source material does give him something to work with and there are interesting themes and ideas running through it. It takes a little bit to get going but after a while the smuggling story and the relationships make for a good adventure that is brisk enough for children while also having a bit of meat for the adults. I quite enjoyed the sweeping adventure feel it had but I was more interested in the character of Fox, who is never a "good man" and is all the better for it (in terms of the narrative). Lang appears to be interested in this as well, and he does make Fox the biggest part of the film.Granger rises to this by turning in a solid performance where he is a rough character but not to the point where he loses the audience. The problem with the film is not with him  unfortunately it is with Jon Whiteley. He is too cute and very much a child actor  and I don't mean that in a good way. He isn't really able to emote and, apologies for the lack of intelligent criticism, but he just got on my nerves. I'm sure this film didn't want to go too deep but I would be happy to see a remake of this with a stronger and more natural child actor in the role, that may allow the relationship to be developed a bit further. Sanders is always a welcome presence but he is given very little to do. The rest of the support cast are all solid enough but the film is pretty much Granger's and he works it well even if Whiteley isn't up to much.Overall though this is a solid little adventure tale that makes for solid family viewing. It is brisk and swashbuckling enough to entertain children while the solid yarn will engage adults. The cast mostly give a good account of themselves and, while I didn't hate him, I must admit that Whiteley was annoying to me personally and his performance here suggested a good education but a limited ability.</p>
