<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now let me just speak my peace before some of you either laugh at me or totally agree with me but i feel Big Trouble in Little China is one of the greatest movies of all time!! Actually it is my favorite movie of all time!! Yes i know such movies as Saving Private Ryan, Shawshank Redemption, or even Willy Wonka might be looked upon as better movies but i say "Who Cares!!!" Big trouble in Little China is a fun movie that you can sit back on a lonely night and just enjoy. The plot is pretty basic and that is why it is easy to follow. Yet the acting of Kurt Russell alone makes the movie. Im not saying this just because i am a BIG KR fan but he just does a wonderful job in this movie as a Truck drive who has no clue on whats going on but just goes with the flow! The witty lines of Kurt Russell in this movie are some of the funniest lines i have ever heard come from an actors mouth.. I mean the whole part of Lo-pan and Jack in the wheelchair is one of the funniest peices of material i have ever seen on the big screen... Well gtg and just remember if some wild 8ft tall monster grabs the back of your favorite head and slams it aganist the bar room wall and ask if you paid your dues!!??! well just tell him what ole jack always says.. " Yes sir the check is in the mail"</p>
