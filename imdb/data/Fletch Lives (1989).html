<h1>Fletch Lives (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fletch is a reporter for a Los Angeles newspaper, but he acts more like a detective. When an obscure relative leaves him a Louisiana mansion in his will, Fletch is naturally curious. Arriving in Louisiana, events occur that make him suspect that all is not well, and there is more to the property than he has been led to believe.</p>
<p>When Irvin "Fletch" Fletcher inherits "Bell Isle", a Louisiana estate, he quits his job at the paper and takes off to live like a king. Or so he thinks. But shortly after arrival he has to find out that the palace he expected really looks more like a run-down shabby mansion. In addition, the young and attractive lawyer he takes to bed that night does not wake up the next morning. After being released from prison, Fletch starts investigating about the murder, an enormous sum of money offered for his rather worthless piece of land, about TV priest Jimmy Lee Farnsworth and his Bibleland and about tons of toxic waste on his ground. Additionally, someone is after Fletch with a serious gun pointed at him. But they all underestimated Fletch, whose journalistic instinct always leads him into the right direction - hopefully.</p>
<p>Fletch fans rejoice! The reckless I.M. Fletcher, investigative reporter, returns to the screen. This time, the chameleon-like reporter ventures to Belle Isle, a sprawling 80-acre Louisiana plantation which Fletch inherits from his aunt. Trouble begins when a lovely attorney mysteriously turns up dead, a neighborly lawyer warns him to leave town, and a ravishing real estate agent comes calling with a persistent offer he may not be able to refuse. Fletch must unravel the reasons for the mad land scramble with his trademark bag of hilarious disguises.</p>
<p>After receiving an inheritance in Louisiana, LA reporter Irvin Fletcher heads to the Belle Isle plantation where he gets himself into hilarious trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peggy-Lee Zorba, Nostradamus, The Colonel, Victor Hugo, Billy-Jean King, Claude-Henry Smoot, Peter Lemonjello, Ed Harley, Elmer-Fudd Gantry and Bobby-Lee Schwartz II. Not to mention Fletch himself. Has Chevy Chase ever played so many people in one film? I love Fletch Lives, it is so damn funny and cackles with hilarious dialogue. It's a bloody shame that the critics were beastly, when it first came out. Chevy Chase, once again, nails the role of Fletch and only he can deliver the deadpan sarcasm in a way no other actor can.Fletch quits his job as an investigative reporter after he inherits a plantation mansion in Louisiana. But he stumbles upon another mystery and does his best to unravel it. Compared to the first the plot may be a little weak but it works fine. The focus seems to have shifted to Fletch's disguises and working set-pieces and gags around them rather than working on layers of mystery. And why the producers commissioned a brand new screenplay instead working from one of Gregory MacDonald's novels is beyond me.His disguises will, however, make you grin from ear to ear (Claude Henry Smoot steals the show) and they way he comes out with the most ridiculous of things when he's talking to people makes you wonder why they ever believe it. As Peter Lemonjello, Fletch tells a studio camera operator that his house is on fire. The guy believes him! I do wish that they had used more of the Bibleland sets as it seems so much for so little screen time but the presence of R. Lee Ermey as the eccentric TV Evangelist makes up for it.And to any of you who are puzzled why Mr. Underhill is credited in the cast of characters but not actually in the film, he IS. Look closely at the Zipedee Doo-Dah sequence and you can see him as one of the dancers.Had the producers treated Fletch like James Bond we might have a new Fletch mystery every two years since 1985 if they followed the order of MacDonald's books (not chronologically, of course, as they're all over the place). It could have turned into Chase's signature roll.There's been talk of a sequel for years and with various names attached as Chase seems to have been ejected from the role. Though he is the ONLY Fletch in my opinion. At the very least, if a sequel IS made, they cannot dispose of Harold Faltermeyer's brilliant score, which I found to be nothing short of awesome when I was a kid, and little has changed since then.</p>
