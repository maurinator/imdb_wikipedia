<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Romantic drama spaning nearly 20 years involving a deaf-mute couple, Haricharian and Aarti. Deaf and dumb bicycle messenger Haricharian meets equally deaf Aarti, and persuades her to go to sign language school to communicate with her mother and brother. The courtship leads to marriage and ultimately a child born to them. Years later, after the death of Aarti from a brief illness, Haricharian's teenage son tries to deal with the after effects as well as his history of being raised by two deaf parents when he begins courting another young girl who also happens to be deaf.</p>
<p>Haricharan Mathur delivers newspapers on his bicycle and lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay, India, just like millions of other Bombayites. But for Haricharan there is a difference - he is both deaf and dumb. One day he comically collides with equally deaf-mute, Aarti, and both fall in love and get married. Soon they give birth to a son, who is normal, much to the relief of his parents. One rainy night, their house gets burglarized by Aarti's brother, Kanu, who leaves the door open, and also steals Hari's bike. The child ventures out in the rain, and subsequently dies, leaving both Aarti and Hari devastated. Their lives get turned upside down, as Hari is unable to deliver newspapers anymore, and must find other means of employment to survive. He does so by polishing shoes. In this manner they survive, and give birth to yet another son, and name him Amit. Hari and Aarti are thrilled that Amit is able to hear and speak, and would like him to study and find a better job. Will Aarti and Hari's dreams be fulfilled? How will Amit turn out?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are very few movies that would leave a lasting impression on your mind long after you have left the movie theater like "koshish" will do. Two of the most talented actors- Sanjeev kumar and Jaya Bhaduri, brings the courage and agony of the two handicapped but strong willed persons. The movie brought national awards to both of these actors. Gulzar directs and writes the dialogues of the movie which are a treat in themselves.</p>
