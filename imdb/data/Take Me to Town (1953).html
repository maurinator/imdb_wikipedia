<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The forms the final part of Sirk's early Americana trilogy. As with the first two films, ("Has Anybody Seen my Gal" and "Meet Me at the Fair") it's is a lightweight, extremely affectionate look at American society in the early part of the 20th Century. Along side the abundant good nature, greed and political corruption were dealt with in those films, whereas in this case its acceptance and tolerance for the "other" to which focus is given.Much of the charm of the movie stems from Ann Sheridan's winning and endearing performance in which she's ably paired by Sterling Hayden. Sirk handles the children particularly well and they turn in lovely comical performances.While a lot of fun to watch, it's of special interest only in the context of Sirk's career in which he would go on to make far more important and weightier films than this.</p>
