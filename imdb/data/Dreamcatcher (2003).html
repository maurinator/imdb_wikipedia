<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>DREAMCATCHERDirector: Lawrence Kasdan, Writers: William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan, Starring: Morgan Freeman as Kurtz, Thomas Jane as Henry, Donnie Wahlberg as Dudits,Rating: 4/4`Dreamcatcher' works on so many different levels. It works great as a drama, as a comedy, as an action film, and as a horror film. I'm a big fan of Stephen King's novels and I'm pleased that `Dreamcatcher' is a faithful adaptation, unlike `The Shining' and `Apt Pupil.' There's a whole lot going on in this film so without ruining anything I'll tell you the basics: four boys were given telepathic powers by a young mentally retarded boy named Dudits. Now they're grown ups and they are spending a weekend in a cabin in a snowy area. What they don't know is that the area they're in a weird disease is loose. The disease is really started by an alien that goes through your body and out your ass. Yuck. The guys have to band together to use their telepathic powers to save the world. I wouldn't want to tell anymore or I'd give a lot of it away.I'm really ticked that every freaking critic out there is giving this film a bad wrap. Of course, it's a sick and disgusting freak show with aliens crawling out of peoples asses, but that's what I liked about this film. It's a drama that doesn't give a crap about showing too much violence or gore. The movie is what it wants to be. The first half of the movie is a good drama then the second half is a blood and gore fiesta! I really liked the dark and scary tone. The camera work was excellent and so was the lighting. I really liked the subplot with Dudits. Dudits rocks! Director Lawrence Kasdan does a great job at showing us what an alien invasion. I also thought Kasdan and Goldman created a great script and faithful adaptation. Goldman did adapt two other of King's books: `Hearts in Atlantis,' and `Misery.' Everyone in this film does a great acting job. Freeman was really convincing as a crazed 'alien-hunter.' The four guys were all convincing as best buds. I really felt a connection between them all. One of my favorite actors, Tom Sizemore, does some of his best work here, and Donnie Wahlberg also does magnificent as a mentally retarded man. I actually felt sorry for him. So if you like horror films so see this movie. For some reason I don't think it'll be as good on the small screen when it comes to DVD.</p>
