<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Last weeks episode ended with a great cliffhanger as Harry(James Nesbitt)and Eve(Sienna Guillory)were forced to play Russian Roulette with nasty Russian bad guy Becker.After managing to trick and kill Becker the two get away and Harry finds himself on the case of a club owner shot dead at his own place of business and gambling addict Tim Larson(Andrew Lee Potts)is the main suspect.Harry and partner Suri realise Larson may have been forced to kill the club owner for Lily Anne the daughter of the casino owner who Harry owed money to to wave Larson's own debt to the club because the club owner was a rival business to her casino.Harry tracks Larson down to a underground den that instead of money they bet on their prized possessions with Harry playing the game and betting his car.He and Larson get out safely thanks once again to Harry's mysterious bracelet which saves Larson from losing his finger.Lily Anne is arrested when evidence is found to prove she was forcing Larson to kill the club owner.Whilst this goes on Suri looks into a message meant for her boss that contains incriminating evidence against Harry.This was another winner from my new favourite British series as every week contains different kind of killings something you must do to keep your audience each week.As ever this series is made that little better by the supreme talent of Jimmy Nesbitt who can make you laugh one minute then impress you with his great and exciting acting the next and even when nothing much seems to be going on he keeps you going with a quip or two plus love his scenes with on screen brother Rich(Stephan Hagan)and I don't know who's funnier to be honest.Other cast members impress especially Karen as Suri and love the buddy cop feel of her and Harry.The likes of Steven MacKintosh as Harry's boss DS Winters and Darren Boyd as DI Orwell are a great sneaky team who are determined to bring Harry down no matter what and scenes where the two of them are trying to wind up Harry and vice versa are great.Once again the bracelet is a big part of the plot as it keeps getting Harry out of life or death situations whether its the Russian Roulette or the gambling game with Larson it becomes each week a bigger and more gripping part of The Lucky Man story.Also the bracelet is playing its part in the side plot of the Winters/Harry/Lily Anne triangle plot involving his debt and can't wait to see how that all unfolds.Another winner from this intriguing and always gripping crime series that has a headline star who keeps you on the edge of your seat one minute and making you laugh the next and though originally a strange bracelet may sound fantasy they manage to ground it and turn this into one of the strongest crime shows from Britain in years.</p>
