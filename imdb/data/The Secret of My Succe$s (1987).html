<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brantley Foster (Michael J,Fox) is from Kansas, wanting to better himself in the big wide world he hits New York hoping to make it big. However, landing a job in the big apple isn't as easy as he had thought. So turning to a tycoon uncle he literally doesn't know, he lands a job the mail room!. From where Brantley leads a double life as he creates Carlton Whitfield and sets about bluffing his way to the top and into the heart of sexy executive Christy Wills (Helen Slater).Michael J. Fox is on cracking comedy form as the young hero of this 1980s light comedy. It's the sort of 80s film that has managed to break out of that decade and still be enjoyable in this latest, power driven, age. The formula is safe and plays out as expected, and the soundtrack, including notable movie riffs, adds to the high sense of energetic fun on offer. Wafer thin plot be damned, Fox delivers on the star vehicle promise and he in turn is backed up by a smashing turn from Margaret Whitton. Silly, unadulterated fun it be. 7/10</p>
