<h1>Sink the Bismarck! (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chronicles the breakout of the Bismarck during the early days of World War Two. Seen both from the point of view of the many naval vessels on both sides and from the central headquarters of the British where the search for the super battleship was controlled.</p>
<p>In 1941 Captain Jonathan Shepard takes over as Director of Operations at naval headquarters in London just as they receive reports that the Bismarck, the pride of the German navy, is going out to sea in the North Atlantic. Shepard argues in favor of moving as many ships as possible to the area to find her. In their first encounter with the Bismarck, the Royal Navy loses HMS Hood, the largest ship in the fleet while HMS Prince of Wales is severely damaged. Shepard then transfers ships from the Mediterranean fleet to go after Bismarck; they include the aircraft carrier Ark Royal on which his son Tom is serving as an aircraft gunner. Damaged in a second encounter, the Bismarck heads for Brest on the French coast and the safety of German coastal defenses and air cover. The only ship in range is the Ark Royal but in their first air sortie, they inadvertently attack HMS Sheffield when they mistake it for the Bismarck. In the second air sortie, they damage the Bismarck sufficiently to allow the surface fleet to catch up to her and sink her.</p>
<p>The World War II story of the British Navy's effort to defeat Nazi Germany's most powerful warship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a little known war time epic movie that should rank with the likes of "Patton". The story is about the grudge match that's spawned from sinking of battleship Hood by the German battleship Bismark. A full blown search for the German battleship by the British navy takes place to hunt down and sink the Bismark. Acting is first class, and although the special effects have something to be desired by today's standard, movie none the less conveys the tension and excitement of what probably was the greatest and the final naval conflict between battleships. In recent years Bob Ballard and the Oceanographic Institute rediscovered the sunken remains of the battleship Bismark which confirmed the ferocity of the fire power that was exchanged in this naval warfare. This movie gets mentioned by movie producers of today when they sight their seminal influence it had on some of their plot lines, which attests to its production value. The sub plot which unfolds between Kenneth Moore and Dana Wynter is also written superbly. A good war time semi documentary that's worth seeing.</p>
