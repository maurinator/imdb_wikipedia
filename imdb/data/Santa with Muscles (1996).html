<h1>Santa with Muscles (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An evil millionaire believes he is Santa Claus after an accident renders him amnesiac.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One word: FORGETTABLE! That's it! Its best use is a substitute for a lump of coal in your stocking! Angry Johnny would thank Santa for it, and because he's been a naughty boy all his life!  Don't let this be next year's X-mas present under your tree!!!</p>
