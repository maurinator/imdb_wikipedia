<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was one of the most violent, nonhorror films that I can recall from the 1970s.  Beyond the blaxploitation label, Foxy Brown is a solid adventure film, that remains timely to this day.  Kudos to Jack Hill, who worked up another treasure with the lovely Ms. Grier. Peter Brown and Kathryn Loder truly deliver unforgettable performances as depraved, sadistic villains, who love each other, but care little for anyone else.  The love their characters share is a contrast to the evil that Mr. Elias and Ms. Wall do. As a note, I try to keep things in perspective, and stick to reviewing each film that I write about.  But to whoever chooses to read this particular comment, please keep something in mind about the blaxploitation films: 1. They are action films, for the most part, beyond race. 2. These movies were made to play up the social issues of the  time, and even today; so yes, most of the villains were white--deal with it!! 3. Because the blaxploitation films were produced in Hollywood, you should take note that the strong, physical prowess exhibited by the heroes and heroines of the films eventually find their way into the mainstream, as the Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando, and Cobra movies of the 1980s and 1990s utilize the same, over-the-top action in urban settings.  These films, with white leads, are more inline with the blaxploitation formula, than Dirty Harry and Death Wish pics; the Eastwood and Bronson characters mainly used their guns, and rarely duked it out with any villains.So maybe I am rambling, but my point is this:  enjoy each film for what it's worth.  And keep in mind, the target audience for blaxploitation movies was ignored by studios during the decades before the 1970s.  If you are white, and like blaxploitation, or of any race and think of these movies as cliched slices of the 1970s, please open your minds and keep a proper perspective of the times.</p>
