<h1>God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?! (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two great stories on forgiveness! "The Grapes of Wrath" features Junior Asparagus as the hapless target of teasing from a bunch of cranky grapes! Junior learns that forgiveness is the best choice, even when people aren't being nice to you! "Larry's Lagoon" is the story of a three hour cruise that takes a turn for the worst when first mate Larry absentmindedly crashes into an uncharted tropical island. Will Skipper Bob be able to forgive Larry for making such a huge blunder?</p>
<p>Two lessons in forgiveness from the Veggie crew: In "The Grapes of Wrath," Junior learns to forgive the Grape family even after they continue teasing him; "Larry's Lagoon" is the story of a ship's crew being marooned on a remote island, and learning to forgive their clumsy first mate (Larry) for accidentally getting them stuck there.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Computer animated veggies...who would think of something kids hate to eat and apply morals to them, to make the best Christian videos ever? BigIdea productions. I think we all need to salute these guys. They take the same technique as the Simpsons (few people do all the voices, great humor, etc.) and apply, as I said before, morals. Great for kids, and even fun for us adults.5/5 STARS</p>
