<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The picture is set in West Africa where we find a roguish geologist adventurer ( George Segal ) and his helper ( Johnny Sekka ), there both of whom encounter a hot rock . But the gem is nevertheless ownership a magnate ( Harry Andrews ) whose gorgeous daughter ( Ursula Andress )is enamored the rogue adventurer . The chief ( Ian Hendry ) of his private troops schemes to get the girl and the diamond . Besides , an ex-security chief ( Orson Welles ) equally tries to steal the precious gem .This amusing film displays action , adventures , humor , rip-roaring and lots of fun . The movie is narrated by means of a continuous pursuit in the jungle and we are seeing several African animals although the most by an excessive use of stock-shots , thus stampeding buffalo , elephants , gnus, lions , snake... and a peculiar thief ostrich . This unknown motion picture obtained limited success in spite of a first-rate cast and result to be immensely agreeable . The tale based on Jules Verne novel is regularly directed by Sidney Hayers . Rating : Average but entertaining . It's a good stuff for young people who enjoy enormously with the extraordinary adventures in the lush jungle.</p>
