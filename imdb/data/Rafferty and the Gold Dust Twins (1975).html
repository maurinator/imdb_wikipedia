<h1>Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hapless driving instructor and former Gunnery Sergeant Rafferty, living in squalor near Hollywood, California, doesn't put up too much of a fight when two ladies hitch a ride and attempt to kidnap him in their attempt to get to New Orleans; while initially put off, Rafferty finds he's charmed by the kooky pair of misfits and the three of them drive to Las Vegas, Nevada and later Tucson, Arizona, where their bond eventually unravels.</p>
<p>Rafferty, a bourbon-swilling road examiner with the Hollywood branch of the DMV, doesn't take much pride in his life. While on a liquid lunch break in a city park, he meets two women traveling together: free-spirited aspiring country singer McKinley - Mac - and her fifteen year old belligerent and angry companion, who calls herself Frisbee. Although initially against his will, Rafferty agrees to drive the pair to their stated destination of New Orleans in his junk heap of a sedan, only knowing a brief outline of their life: how they met and why they're going to New Orleans. He does so largely in his attraction to Mac. Along the away, the trio get into one misadventure after another as they orchestrate one scam after another to finance their trip. But as their trip was initiated by Fris, their collective plans may change based on what is waiting for them, or more precisely what isn't waiting for them in New Orleans.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins" is a character study, loaded with great character actors. It is also unpredictable, with occasional bursts of outrageous humor. Alan Arkin plays a hard drinking, totally inept, and burned out driving instructor. Sally Kellerman, is a wannabe country singer, accompanied by Mackenzie Phillips, a fifteen year old hustler. These three hit the road for New Orleans, scamming and thieving along the way. The colorful characters they encounter include Alex Rocco as a Las Vegas nut job, Charles Martin Smith as a soldier who gets scammed, and Harry Dean Stanton as a one legged veteran who gets hustled at pool. Also, there is a rather unexpected ending to this road trip of broken dreams. - MERK</p>
