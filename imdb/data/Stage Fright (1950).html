<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jonathan Cooper is wanted by the police who suspect him of killing his lover's husband. His friend Eve Gill offers to hide him and Jonathan explains to her that his lover, actress Charlotte Inwood is the real murderer. Eve decides to investigate for herself, but when she meets the detective in charge of the case, she starts to fall in love.</p>
<p>Eve Gill, an aspiring young actress, shelters a fellow acting student, Jonathan Cooper, from the police. He is suspected of murdering the husband of his mistress, Charlotte Inwood, a famous singer. Jonathan claims that he became implicated when he tried to help Charlotte destroy the evidence. Eve's eccentric father, Commodore Gill, agrees to hide Jonathan in his house while she proves his innocence. To do this, Eve becomes Charlotte's temporary maid. Eve's Father devises a plan to force Charlotte to confess in front of the inspector investigating the case, Wilfred Smith. When the plan doesn't work, Eve tries blackmailing Charlotte into a confession while the police listen outside her dressing room. Charlotte agrees to pay, but insists that Jonathan is the real killer.</p>
<p>In London, the aspirant actress Eve Gill and her friend Jonathan Cooper are fleeing from the police in her car to her father's boat two hours far from the city. Eve has a crush on Jonathan that tells her that a couple of hours later, his mistress and actress Charlotte Inwood had come to his apartment with her dress covered of gore and telling that she had killed her husband. Jonathan decided to go to her apartment to bring a new dress for Charlotte, but her maid saw him in the crime scene and called the police that are chasing him as prime suspect. Eve's father Commodore Gill lodges Jonathan at his house and the man destroys the dress that is the evidence of the murder. Eve decides to investigate by herself to prove Jonathan's innocence and gets closer to Charlotte, working as temporary maid. Meanwhile Detective Wilfred Smith that is in charge of the case befriends Eve and they fall in love for each.</p>
<p>Hoping that she will help hide him, Jonathan Cooper confides in his friend Eve Gill, a novice acting student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, that he is helping famed stage actress Charlotte Inwood, with who he is in love, cover up her accidental killing of her husband. Jonathan believes he is in trouble because Charlotte, who was wearing a blood stained dress, asked Jonathan to retrieve a clean dress for her at her supposedly empty house where he suspects he was spotted by the maid, Nellie Goode, just prior to Nellie finding the dead body. Eve agrees to help Jonathan since she is in love with him, and who she believes is being framed by Charlotte. Charlotte's blood stained dress, which she asked Jonathan to destroy but which he still has in his possession, is a key piece of evidence in implicating Charlotte. When the police get involved, Eve tries to find out as much as she can from the lead investigator, Detective Inspector Wilfred Smith - who she ends up calling Ordinary Smith on his request - without divulging her connection to Jonathan. With her equally sleuthing father Commodore Gill behind her, Eve, trying to demonstrate her acting skills, also infiltrates the Inwood household acting as Charlotte's temporary plain housemaid and dresser. These dual roles becomes difficult for Eve to manage, especially in keeping them separated from Ordinary as he continues his investigation, and from Charlotte. In the process, Eve, who still wants to protect her friend Jonathan, ends up falling in love with Ordinary. But as those concerned get closer and closer to discovering the truth behind Inwood's death with Charlotte's blood stained dress a key item in trying to expose the killer, Eve, without realizing it, becomes a possible second target for the murderer.</p>
<p>A struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence when he's accused of murdering the husband of a high society entertainer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie gets a very much undeserved amount of flack for being a lessor work of Hitchcock. I can see why it might not appeal to some people, being character driven rather than having children being chased by rampant birds or someone being attacked by a serial killer in an old lady's wig. The performances here are all excellent especially Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich as Charlotte Inwood, perhaps the laziest girl in town but also the most flamboyant. The secondary characters are also in fine form and make memorable impressions that adds to the enjoyment factor of this film. I don't know why some people feel tricked after watching the movie, seeing and believing are two different things, especially in an Alfred Hitchcock movie!</p>
