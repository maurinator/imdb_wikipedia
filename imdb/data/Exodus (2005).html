<h1>Exodus (2005)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Johnny and Turtle get a gold watch, paid by Vince from his Aquaman bundle, to welcome Saigon to Turtle's company; however they see Mandy with her ex-steady date Chris, so they make cellphone pictures as proof she's apparently cheating on the star. Ari finds his senior partner Terence McQuewick, who didn't attend in three years, chairs the staff meeting and bars him for arriving late; in private he says he's returning full-time, and denies Ari a contract extension as consolation. Ari panics and swears his assistant Lloyd to undying loyalty before sending him out to tell eights agents the code 'tsetse fly', but Lloyd phones Terence already knows, who indeed brands him as a traitor; Ari then invites colleagues to join him in a new agency, but only Lloyd follows him and they find all company privileges are cut of, stat. Sloan reassures E Mandy is probably not cheating. E tells Vince he never felt it was over with Chris, and indeed Mandy confirms she is not quite sure yet, so he breaks up and- wants out of the movie. A 'jealous pep-talk' from Lloyd gives drunk Ari the courage to face his wife, or not quite.</p>
