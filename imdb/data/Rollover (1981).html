<h1>Rollover (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Arab oil organization devises a plan to wreck the world economy in order to cause anarchy and chaos.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An over valued dollar, the system on the brink, the big bankers and their government stooges have gone too far. Sound familiar? The previous poster attributes the financial melt down in the movie to capitalism. Actually, the movie doesn't touched at all on the causes of the system breakdown. But it is not capitalism, but government interference in the market which would cause such a melt down.  But it is fun to see central banking get its just reward, and to see gold emerge a winner.</p>
