<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It sounds like a clich√©, but I don't know anybody who didn't like this film. I recommended it to a number of people, and all were impressed with it as I was.Excellent acting and an interesting low-key story make this a very enjoyable 110 minutes of entertainment. A story about two old geezers who take in a 14-year- old to their home for a month doesn't sound too exciting but this film will surprise you.It's tough to find two elder gentlemen as good and appealing as Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, anyway, so you have two winners right there. Add a fine, fine young actor in Haley Joel Osment and now you have three excellent actors who comprise most of the lines of the film.This is one of those rare "guarantee" movies in which you can safely tell your friends to watch it and not regret the recommendation.</p>
