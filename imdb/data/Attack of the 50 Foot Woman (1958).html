<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What happens when a wealthy woman meets a giant opaque alien and his satellite in the desert.  Why she ends up becoming a 50 foot woman bent on fixing her marriage with her adulterous husband!  Great 50's hokum here!  Lovely Allison Hayes plays a woman who has recently been checked out of a sanitorium and has major drinking/marriage problems.  Her husband Harry is the scum of the earth as he flirts(and beyond) with beautiful Honey(Vickers).  Both of them want Allison's money, all 50 million of it.  The story is pretty ambiguous, and we really never do know just who or what that alien was all about.  The best part is seeing just how low and sleazy Harry is, so we can wait to see him get his.  The acting is pretty good, nothing great.  The direction by Nathan Juran is adequate(nothing like what you would see in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad!).  The special effects are fairly standard as we really never see Allison Hayes as a fully-materialized giant.  She always seems to be a bit transparent for some reason except when we see her giant hand.  Hayes looks great as a giant though in her skimpy shorts and bikini top, giving at least two great reasons to see the film...or is that three?  Great 50's sci-fi fun!</p>
