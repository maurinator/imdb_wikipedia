<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I felt that this movie was a good movie.  It had great actors, a great plot, and a great environment, which is the church in which the escape convicts fled and hid to. This movie really got me thinking about how short life is and how we should spend it the best way possible, which Sean Penn did at the end of the movie, which is to love and serve God.</p>
