<h1>My Man (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Lyon, where many are unemployed, Marie is a prostitute who loves her work: she's thoughtful and exuberant toward clients old and young, slim or flabby. One night, a homeless man sleeps in the foyer of her apartment house; she gives him a hot meal, then a place on the floor to sleep by her radiator, then she offers herself. She falls in love, giving him new life, clothes, a place to live. When he grouses that he must bar hop while she uses the flat for her work, she finds them a larger flat. He grows restless, seducing a manicurist and pressing her to prostitution. He's arrested for procuring, so Marie must decide what to do; he, too, must face the consequences of his choices.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"My Man" is an artsy, fatalistic drama done in the typical French the-ecstacy-is-in-the-agony style. Telling a peculiar, quirky, melancholy story of a neurotic prostitute's encounters with men in an apparently futile attempt to bring meaning into her life the story overlooks obvious alternatives at every turn and meanders into dark self-deprecating blind alleys. Nonetheless, this strange drama is slick, well crafted, and worth a look by those who are into unusual psychodramas.</p>
