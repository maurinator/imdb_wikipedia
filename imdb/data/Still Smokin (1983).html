<h1>Still Smokin (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cheech & Chong are invited to a celebrity party/festival in Amsterdam. When they get there, however, it turns out that the guy who invited them has taken off with all the money, and the rest of the hosts have a VERY limited budget. They are actually expecting Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton, so our heroes gets to be Mr. Burt and Mr. Dolly. We follow them around Amsterdam, at their hotel, (still) smokin' joints and doing shows.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an incredibly funny film! More like a series of wacky sketches rather than a movie with a plot, but great fun nonetheless. We were all falling out of our chairs laughing. Cheech and Chong are awfully talented! The dog routine, the invisible man, the hairy palm, the E.T. routine.. I saw the movie day before yesterday and I still cant hold back my laughter when I remember those scenes! These guys should have made a TV series, they are awesome!</p>
