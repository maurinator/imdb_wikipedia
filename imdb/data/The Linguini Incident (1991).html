<h1>The Linguini Incident (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two disgruntled restaurant employees (David Bowie, Rosanna Arquette) decide to rob their employers (Buck Henry, Andre Gregory).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was witty, clever and fun.  It was even better the second time. Every time I see it, I notice something new.It is a true social commentary on the "trend-sucking leeches" of New York City in the 1990's.</p>
