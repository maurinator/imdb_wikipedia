<h1>Rude Boy (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rude Boy is a semi-documentary, part character study, part 'rockumentary', featuring a British punk band, The Clash. The script includes the story of a fictional fan juxtposed with actual public events of the day, including political demonstrations and Clash concerts. Filmed over a period of years, the written dialog takes on the appearance of improvisation.</p>
<p>A young British punk and roadie for The Clash navigates life in socially torn 1970s England.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite all the negative commentary about this hodge-podge docudrama, it really is a fine testament to the spirit if not the letter of the punkers and the politics of the 70's.  With the recent death of the talented and idealistic Joe Strummer, it is the film's insight into his talent and personality, his dynamic stage presence, and his role as a driving force behind the anti-institution known as the Clash that makes this film an important cultural and musical document. I also think it's very entertaining outside the musical numbers, if appropriately depressing.</p>
