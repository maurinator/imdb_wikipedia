<h1>Fever Pitch (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Investigative sports journalist veteran Steve Taggart is working on his latest story - an inside look at professional gambling. The subject of his piece is a man he calls Mr. Green, a degenerate gambler who indirectly ruined his family and yet still can't stop gambling or betting. His editor loves the story but what he doesn't know is that Mr. Green is actually Taggart himself. In order to get more inside info about his topic, Taggart visits various gambling venues and interviews several people including a friendly casino manager and his top cocktail waitress Flo, who was once a gambling addict herself. However, Taggart has bigger problems than dealing with his addiction and finishing his assignment, since his lawn shark is threatening to harm his little daughter, who lives in a nice boarding school, unless he pays up his growing debt. Taggart tries to deal with everything his own way - with more gambling. Eventually, writing the article becomes a form of personal catharsis for desperate Taggart and helps him finally decide to try to face his problems, but the story takes an unexpected turn at the end.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And channeling Samuel Fuller, this is one of those movies (like the Oscar) so wrong that it is awfully, hilariously right. Brooks' sensibility must have been faltering because he flashed back to the 50s (traveling montages, "exposes" of sensational subjects, Chad Everett!) and flopped this sizzling cinematic spectacle into theaters across America! Where I saw it originally. I have had to revisit it a few times just to make sure it was for real. And now it's not available! And where's The Oscar? Which starred Steven Boyd and Tony Bennett in the film role that kept him out of the movies for decades. But seriously, Fever Pitch is a last gasp effort from a filmmaker too tired to pucker up anymore.</p>
