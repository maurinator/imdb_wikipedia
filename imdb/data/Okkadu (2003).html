<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the films that took the tollywood industry by surprise... Everything in the film were almost perfect and one can also go on to say that it was FLAWLESS..! The music was good and the background score was simply great..Everybody got what they wanted..! The main thing that became an asset to the film was the way in which the director lead the film..the screenplay was awesome because it always kept the viewers guessing on what is going to happen next..! So overall a superb film and a good career boost for MAHESH..! Some of the music tracks that I found were foot tapping were Hare rama Hare Krishna and the melodies Nuvve Maya chesavo kani and Nuvve Maya chesavo kani ila ee kshanam agiponi took the viewers into a trance..! The climax scene were the Hero finally delivers a killer blow is one of the best scenes ever shot until then..!</p>
