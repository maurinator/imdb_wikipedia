<h1>Out of Season (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this tense story of an unusual romantic triangle, middle-aged Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) and her teenage daughter Joanna (Susan George) manage a failing hotel on an island off the British coast. One day, the hotel receives an unexpected guest, a man named Joe (Cliff Robertson). Joe and Ann had an affair years ago, and it's suggested (though never stated) that Joanna could be their child. Joe and Ann soon renew their relationship, but Ann discovers that she has a rival for Joe's affections when Joanna makes her interest in the handsome older man clear. Also shown under the title Winter Rates (the title of the stage drama upon which it was based), Out of Season was at one time to have been directed by the noted playwright Harold Pinter, but he was eventually replaced by stage and screen veteran Alan Bridges.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Out of Season was in fact filmed on Portland, Dorset, England, at an area very close to The Verne prison. The filming was indeed very clever, since there are no buildings where the hotel was supposed to be situated, nor were there when the film was made. The "road to the village" was in fact a lane which is known as "the old road", and runs from the top of Portland, to Fortuneswell, joining the " new road ", and then across Chesil Beach to the mainland. The film itself is extremely good and well worth a look.</p>
