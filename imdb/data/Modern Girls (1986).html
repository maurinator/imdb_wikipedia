<h1>Modern Girls (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Geeky Clifford has a date with pretty Kelly. But when he comes to pick her up, she has gone to see her ex-boyfriend, the DJ at a nightclub, using her roommate Margo's car. Margo and their third roommate, CeCe, induce Clifford into driving them around, first to the nightclub to find Kelly, then on an all-night tour of the L.A. night scene in search of CeCe's new love, rock star Bruno X.</p>
<p>Margo, Kelly, and CeCe have three things in common: they're roomates, they're gorgeous, and they're hooked on the glamour and excitement of L.A.'s rock and roll night life. These dating Modern Girls are in for a night of their lives. Because tonight, their usual fun and games get hilariously funny and seriously dangerous when they get mixed up with a rock star, an arrogant ex-boyfriend, a pseudo-sadist, and the nicest nerd in The City Of Angels. It's a full night to say the least-full of fun, sex, laughs, and rock and roll!</p>
<p>A pair of women decide to prank their roommate's nerdy blind date after she stands him up, but end up developing a friendship with him after their practical joke sends them on an all-night odyssey through the 1980s club scene.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yum. These girls were sensational in this movie. This was the first time I would know of Virginia Madsen and Daphne Zuniga because I know of Cynthia Gibb ("Search for Tomorrow" and "Fame") but I saw this flick and I liked it so much. When I did catch this movie on cable, I remember living this kind of lifestyle at the time, (19 years old, going out on Friday nights to trendy clubs, didn't know what I wanted to do in my life as yet except to live), I did relate to these girls and what they wanted to get out in their lives going out barhopping. I had a lot of fun enjoying this film and the characters was so much different from each other. You had Cece - the attractive, bubblehead, red hair, (which that was an attractive shade of red on Cynthia), Kelly - the one who couldn't figure out what made her attracted by this sleazeball, dj, but couldn't get him out of her head and Margo - who was definitely the force in there lives. Long lives that life and when I saw this movie I was at that stage at that lifetime. (Now 33 yrs old). But who could ever forget the part of the WonderBread bus and the passengers mistaken Cliff as the rock star Bruno X or the food fight at the club, or the fight that took place in the fountain. And I have to say that it was a good thing that none of them was actually selfish with what they wanted like such as Margo pointed out to Cece that they went through hell just for you to dump them for Bruno X. But Margo went through with helping out her friend and roommate to look for Bruno. And it was good when Cece realized that she didn't want this lifestyle that Bruno was going to provide and make sure she was taken care of. It was when she realized that she was going to miss her friends if she took off with him and she stopped and realized that Kelly, Margo and Cliff was more important in her life than being with a publicized rock star. But it was a great film that I loved and was always hoping for a sequel to come out and see where their lives has taken them now. And who could forget the part when Cliff had to go after a limo only to be a bunch of Arabs with machine guns to follow them.</p>
