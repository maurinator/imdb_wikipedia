<h1>The State of Things (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On location in Portugal, a film crew runs out of film while making their own version of Roger Corman's Day the World Ended (1955). The producer is nowhere to be found and director Friedrich Munro attempts to find him in hopes of being able to finish the film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not only is this film a classic - the short ends became Stranger Than Paradise making this film a true two-fer.A very anti-Hollywood film structured first as a kind of meditation and then turning into a great faux whodunit indictment of Hollywood itself. This won't make a lot of sense until you actually see the film - but see it you must if you are a true film afficianado. Ignore the ridiculous film geek influenced 7.3 rating - the actual rating of 7.7 is much more accurate. One of the films that made Wim Wenders great.</p>
