<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Washed up singer/actor Frank Elgin has a chance to make a come-back when director Bernie Dodd offers him the leading role in his new musical. Frank however is very insecure, turns to alcohol and shuns even the smallest of responsibilities, leaving everything up to his wife Georgie who finds it harder and harder to cope with her husband's lack of spirit. Bernie tries to help Frank regain his self-confidence, believing that it is Georgie who's the cause of his insecurity.</p>
<p>Broadway director Bernie Dodd is in desperate need of a male lead for his new play and pushes to hire Frank Elgin, an aging one time star with just the experience and skills required. The downside is that he has a reputation for being an unreliable drunk. Elgin has the talent for the job, but seems to be entirely dependent on his wife Georgie to make all of his decisions for him. He tells Dodd that she has to come with them when they go to Boston to fine tune the show. He describes his wife as the drinker and suicidal at times and simply can't be left alone. Dodd takes up his cause, blaming Georgie for Frank's lack of self-confidence and a clash of wills ensues. He soon realizes he may have incorrectly assumed who was supporting who in their relationship.</p>
<p>A director hires an alcoholic has-been and strikes up a stormy relationship with the actor's wife, who he believes is the cause of all the man's problems.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It has long been assumed that, had the music been eliminated from "The Country Girl" and, in the process, taking emphasis off Bing Crosby's singing and more on his acting, he would have certainly beaten Marlon Brando for the Oscar of 1954.  Crosby is extraordinary in this film, playing an alcoholic, washed-up actor/singer with few if any redeemable qualities.  William Holden, as the director of a new Broadway musical, insists that Bing be cast in the lead role, even though he is painfully aware of the actor's history.  Grace Kelly is Bing's misunderstood wife.  While all three performances are first rate, it is Crosby who stands so far above the others, especially considering Hollywood's idea of realism in 1954.  Kelly, on the other hand, who DID win an Oscar as best actress, seems workmanlike but not of that acting calibur.  Miss Kelly was such a glamorous "star" that simply putting her in a frumpy housedress does not a plain and ordinary housewife make!  Her last scene, in which she appears in a very elegant evening gown (but with glasses to downplay her beauty) is completely unconvincing.  But, taken as a whole, "The Country Girl" is great video viewing!</p>
