<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Perky, perfect Carolyn and her Alpha Omega Pi sisters plan to win Sorority of the Year by impressing the Greek Council with a killer charity: coaching mentally challenged athletes for the regional Challenged Games. When Carolyn's assigned to coach Pumpkin she's terrified at first, but soon sees in him something she's never seen before: a gentle humanity and honest clarity that touches her soul. To the horror of her friends and Pumpkin's overprotective mother, Carolyn falls in love, becoming an outcast in the process. As Carolyn's "perfect life" falls apart, Pumpkin teaches her that perfect isn't always perfect after all.</p>
<p>A sorority girl is drawn to a disabled man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie takes a while to get used to.  It's not exactly a conventional movie.  I rented it because I like Christina Ricci and had heard that the movie was very good.  In the end I'd say it was kind of cute but not a very special movie.  Marisa Coughlan plays a sorority sister and has some funny scenes.  I'd say rent it for cheap.</p>
