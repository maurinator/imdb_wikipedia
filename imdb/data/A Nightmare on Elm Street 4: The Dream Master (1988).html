<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Its funny how I stumbled on to the Nightmare on Elm Street Serises. I was about 8 or 9 at the time. My father and I had a great relationship. He would take me to a movie every week. I was the envy of all the other kids because he didn't care if a movie was rated R or what. So here I am looking to go to our Friday movie and my dad is looking in the paper asking me what I want to see. He asked me if I was ready for my first scary movie. I jumped for joy when he asked me that. At that time I hadn't really seen a true scary movie yet. Just the ones that where on during Halloween. So off we went me and my dad. I remember how nervous I was because I didn't know what to expect. Here I am 9 years old in the movie line with all these teenagers grabbing there girlfriend waste and making scary faces trying to scare them. I just grabbed my fathers hand very tight and made my way in.Wow! My first scary movie I thought to myself well here it goes. I remember asking my dad if Freddy was real about 10 times during the movie. I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I was in love with horror. I Was Freddys number 1 fan after this movie. I bought all the older movies. I really liked number 1 and thought number 2 was really weird back then. Anyways I love this movie for all the right reasons. There is a lot of gore. A lot of cheesy acting and just plain fun. I am not going to give anything away just go wacth it for yourself. You will love it.</p>
