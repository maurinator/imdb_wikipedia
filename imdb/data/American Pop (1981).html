<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen this movie since it came out nearly two decades ago and yet I remember it like it was yesterday.  Perhaps being a member of the clan that the movie depicts gives it special meaning for me.  The strand connecting the chants of the ghetto synagogue, through early jazz, sixties ballads and finally hard rock rang true to this unsophisticated viewer.  Perhaps the characters where often cliches and the symbolism hackneyed- but so what. This is the shorthand of our culture and these iconic elements were used with wit, charm and taste. Animation in this film is truly an artistic medium. The memory of the final scene, where generations of suffering are vindicated in the roar of acclaim for the rock singer descendent, still brings a chill to my spine.</p>
