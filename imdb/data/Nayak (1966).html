<h1>Nayak (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A matinee idol Arindam Mukherjee (Uttam Kumar) is going by train to collect an acting award. On the train, he is confronted by a journalist Aditi (Sharmila Tagore) who somewhat unwillingly starts to take his interview. Arindam, won over by Aditi's naivete, starts to disclose his past, his fears and his secrets. On a parallel track, a number of sub-plots unfold (involving an advertising executive and his wife, a businessman and his family, a silent swami and a cranky old man) to reveal the hypocrisies and frailties of the society. The film reaches a climax when Arindam, overcome by his guilt, contemplates suicide and is dissuaded by Aditi. The next morning, Aditi who had surreptitiously taken notes of their conversation destroys them - not wanting to reveal Arindam's darkest secrets. When the train reaches its destination, Arindam alights and is surrounded by his fans and is back to his normal star self where there is no place for guilt, confessions and Aditi.</p>
<p>En route to Delhi to receive an award, a Bengali film star reevaluates his success through his fellow passengers, dreams and past experiences.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film has a beautiful script most aptly delineating a life of a matinee idol. Brilliantly performed by Uttam Kumar, originally the  matinee idol of contemporary Bengal, this was probably the best role that he acted in. His glamorous screen presence in the entire movie is most impressive and is definitely the mainstay of the movie. The story was supposedly written, keeping his struggle to stardom and the tolls of stardom in mind. Perhaps one of the most important reasons that Uttam performed so well was that he could probably identify himself in the role.  Once again, coming to the scripts, written by the maestro Satyajit Ray, himself was simply superb. Within a span of a train journey from Calcutta to Delhi, the entire life of a film star, with all its shades was most adeptly portrayed. With such a script and direction by Ray it is a pleasure to watch the movie. The performances by other actors are also commendable.</p>
