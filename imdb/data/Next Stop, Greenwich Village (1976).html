<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I felt like this is what life must truly have been like in the Village in '53. Everything was in order. I was transported. Special kudos go out to Antonio Fargas, who plays a gay man in a tremendously ballsy portrayal considering his Starsky and Hutch days. Also, to the great chemistry of the cast.It was sad to see Lenny Baker passed away at such a young age. He was definitely in the Hoffman, Pacino, but funnier mold. He should be remembered.</p>
