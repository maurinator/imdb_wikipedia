<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was a pleasant surprise. The quirky dialog is what makes the characters compelling and that is really the glue here. Through the 3 Thanksgiving gatherings the storyline zigzags unexpectedly and its always interesting.The humor is dark, and it works so well for me. Part of the charm is that no matter how despicable any family member may be at times, they don't seem totally bad. Its a comfortable place to watch from when all the characters have shown their clear vulnerabilities.The film description on IMDb tells what I don't need to repeat. If you like quirky characters, unpredictable twists set in the wild card of family gatherings, you should check it out.</p>
