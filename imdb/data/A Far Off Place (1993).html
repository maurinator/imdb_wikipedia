<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The witty Nonni and the stuck-up city-boy Harry are the only ones to survive a massacre of a gang of poachers among the gamekeeper's family on his lonesome farm in the savanna. Now the ruthless murderers are after them as the only witnesses. Without a means of transportation, the only way to escape is to walk through 2000 kilometers of Kalahari desert with the help of the African bushman Xhabbo. On the months-long journey ahead they not only become good friends against their differences, but also realize that every one of them has strength and skills that are required to survive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Reese Witherspoon is classical in this hypnotizing adventure movie. The remaining cast is praiseworthy. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, A Far Off Place will lure the viewer on an unforgettable journey. 8 out of 10.</p>
