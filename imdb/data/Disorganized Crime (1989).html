<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was so surprised by this movie, I had to give it some praise.  It starts off a little awkward, but it ended up being one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen!! I got it from Walmart for $5 and got more out of it than any $20 DVD.  Corbin Bernsen and Ed Oneill give great comedic performances and Lou Diamond Phillips is just fun to watch in this highly entertaining caper.  It's not pee in your pants funny, but it is thoroughly enjoyable and worth a look.</p>
