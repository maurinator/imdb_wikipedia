<h1>The Smokers (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Looking back a few years later, Jefferson Roth tells the story of the last few weeks of her senior year at a Wisconsin boarding school when she and two girl friends, the naive Lisa and the outrageous Karen, use a pistol to turn the tables on men (boys, really) who make them feel weak, put upon, and desired only as sex objects. They stage a sexual assault on David, who's been hot and cold toward Lisa. Meanwhile, each of the three keeps trying to find love even while Karen wants to attack others: Jefferson falls for a cowboy singer, ignoring a boy she grew up with, Jeremy, who likes her; Lisa tries again to reach David; Karen puts herself at risk with an older man. Can it end well?</p>
<p>Three rebellious teenage girls decide to even the score in the battle of the sexes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Moviegoers who love cult films should take notice!  The Smokers is a real contender. It's not fair to compare The Smokers with Heathers because Heathers characters were never this *@#%" Up!  The Costumes and makeup were great and Christina Peters made an excellent contribution to the ever-growing coming of age category.</p>
