<h1>Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ann Lake has recently settled in England with her daughter, Bunny. When she goes to retrieve her daughter after the girl's first day at school, no one has any record of Bunny having been registered. When even the police can find no trace that the girl ever existed, they wonder if the child was only a fantasy of Ann's. When Ann's brother backs up the police's suspicions, she appears to be a mentally-disturbed individual. Are they right?</p>
<p>The American single mother Ann Lake seeks out someone in the nursery Little People's Garden School in Hampstead. She finds a German cook and explains that she has just moved from the United States to London and she left her daughter Bunny Lake at the First Day Room alone with a baby. Now she needs to receive the delivery men at the apartment she rented and she needs to leave Bunny for a moment and the cook says that she can check on her daughter. When Ann returns, she does not find neither the cook nor Bunny and no one in the nursery seems to have seen the girl. Ann calls her brother Steven Lake and the police. Superintendent Newhouse investigates the case with his men and there is no evidence of the little girl. Soon he begins to question whether Bunny Lake does exist or is Ann's imaginary daughter.</p>
<p>Having just arrived in London from Boston, single mother Ann Lake believes that she has dropped her four year old illegitimate daughter, Felicia - who Ann has nicknamed Bunny, the name of her imaginary childhood friend - off for her first day at her new school. Ann's belief is tested when she goes to pick up Bunny after school, Bunny who is not there. No one at the school even remembers ever seeing Bunny. The only person in London who knows Ann and can vouch for her assertion is her brother, magazine reporter Steven Lake. Ann's worry is heightened because there have been a few child abductions and murders of late. The police are brought into the matter. The further that sympathetic lead investigator, Superintendent Newhouse, gets into the investigation, the more it seems like Bunny is a figment of Ann's imagination, her fantasy supported by Steven for her own mental well-being. Steven however seems convinced that someone knows of Bunny's disappearance, that someone perhaps being one of the plethora of school administrators including its elderly owner, Ada Ford, or the Lake's seemingly eccentric landlord, Horatio Wilson.</p>
<p>A woman reports that her young daughter is missing, but there seems to be no evidence that she ever existed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't remember how old I was when I saw "Bunny Lake is Missing" - I was only 5 years old when it was released in theaters, and I know that I saw it on television, so I must have been around 10 or 12.  All I know is that I have remembered it to this day, and when even the title of a movie, seen only once at such a young age, is etched forever in your memory, you know it's something worth seeing again.  I can't remember every detail of the plot, but I remember the haunting feeling I had after seeing this movie, the realization for the first time, being so young, that things truly are not always as they seem.  I have often thought about this movie over the years, and have always watched for it among late-night television, and among video titles, and this is the first place I have ever found mention of it - I was beginning to think it was one of those childhood memories that came from a vivid dream rather then from reality.  I am happy to know that my memory was real, and that there are those who feel this movie was truly as great as I remember it being.  I hope that someday it is made available - I look forward to the day when I can see it again.</p>
