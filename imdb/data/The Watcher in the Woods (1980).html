<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beating other films such as "Candleshoe" and "Escape To Witch Mountain" by far, this is the best film Disney ever produced, and I am outraged that this film does NOT get the right justice it deserves! I have enjoyed this film for years, and years, and never would I have guessed that Disney is the real villian when it comes to this chiller! Disney used to make film for adults, as well as chilldren, and now, children are so spoiled and rotten, and Disney is the rat! All Disney ever does is make rediculous films and TV shows depicting miscreants and awful characters! Back in the day, when movies were made right, Disney knew how to pack a punch! Children are clueless as far as this film is concerned, they do not know how to enjoy it, at least, not like we adults can. This movie was the film that made music box music a vary creepy thing, as Stanly Meyers brilliant score opens the film, with a slight ringing, and strings bringing out the dead still of the woods. The rest of the film is followed by great acting, good cinematography, and terrific special effects! What else an I say about this ghost story about families, alike, and different, and haunted by the lost spirit of a girl, trying to find her way home, and the angry soul, who switched places with her years ago? I LOVE this film, I will always praise it to the highest, and I weep for those who dismiss it!</p>
