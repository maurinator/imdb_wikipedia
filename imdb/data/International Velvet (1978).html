<p>Velvet's orphaned niece, Sarah, follows her dream of Olympic glory with her horse Arizona Pie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I absolutely love this movie, I cry every time...maybe because as a girl, I always wanted to ride in the Olympics, I don't know. Of course it isn't the same as the original, (another movie I love), but it's set in a completely different time...The riding sequences were great, the references to the original were good, and overall, the acting was pretty good. Christopher Plummer was a surprise, and I loved Anthony Hopkins in his part as the taskmaster coach! I own the video, and have shown it to my young daughters...they love it too!A piece of fluff definitely, but for a girl who had a dream...it's awesome!</p>
