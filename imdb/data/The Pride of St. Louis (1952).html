<h1>The Pride of St. Louis (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of Jerome "Dizzy" Dean, a major-league baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dan Dailey is a bright spot in this otherwise run of the mill baseball movie that could have been so much better. Like most films that deal with baseball, you don't get the idea that you are seeing anything close to realistic play on the field. If you love baseball as I do, try Pride of the Yankees, with Gary Cooper. In it many of the Yankee players actually were seen on the filed including the great Babe Ruth.</p>
