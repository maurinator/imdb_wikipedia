<h1>Gray's Anatomy (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Spalding Gray has an eye condition that can be surgically corrected. He decides to seek alternate treatment and embarks on a journey that will take him to Christian Science, Native American sweat lodges and psychic surgeons, among others.</p>
<p>After doctors inform him that an eye affliction will require risky surgery, monologist Spalding Gray recounts his various pursuits for alternative medicine to avoid the doctor's scalpel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The trick here is to make a monologue a filmic experience. Gray's stories are fascinating. He's interesting to watch, but an hour and a half looking at his face is a little much to ask an audience. Soderbergh tries to mix it up a little, varying the backgrounds and moving the camera around, but doesn't go far enough. The short sequences of eye trauma interviews filmed in black and white are like islands of relief in a sea of Spalding and I wish there were more of that sort of thing in the film.</p>
