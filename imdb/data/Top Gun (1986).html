<h1>Top Gun (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lieutenant Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is an expert United States Naval Aviator. When he encounters a pair of MiGs over the Persian Gulf, his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks. On almost no fuel, Maverick is able to talk him back down to the carrier. When his wingman turns in his wings, Maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his father's death in combat that killed others due to his father's error. Maverick struggles to be the best pilot, stepping on the toes of his other students and in another way to Charlie Blackwood, a civilian instructor to whom he is strongly attracted.</p>
<p>As students at the United States Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young pilot learns a few things from a civilian instructor that are not taught in the classroom.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is a school of thought that says all movies should be compared on an absolute scale.  It would say that movies must have a high level of credibility or familiarity in order to be "good" movies.  People who fall into this category simply should not watch Top Gun.  They won't enjoy it. Other people take the opposite, but no more valid approach of looking a each movie individually, disregarding all else but the movie.  For these people, no outside reality or credibility is important, because for them, a movie exists to entertain in whatever way it chooses to.  These people would enjoy Top Gun very much.  It is extremely doubtful that the producers ever even considered making Top Gun as a portrait of a fighter pilot's life, and this is why it is entertaining.  It is a rare type of movie, one that no one dares to make today, one that not only transcends reality, but wears it as a mask into the world of fantasy.  Everything from the wild dogfights to the fake love to the over the top glamorized (or should I say canonized) characters lets you know that this is a good old American hero drama.  That is why it is a horrible and fraudulent portrait of reality, and that is why I love it.</p>
