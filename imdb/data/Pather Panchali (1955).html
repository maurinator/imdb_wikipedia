His mother Sarbojaya bears the brunt of the family's situation. She scrapes by and sells her personal possessions to put food on the table and has to bear the taunts of her neighbors as Durga is always stealing fruit from their orchard.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have just finished Pather Panchali. To be honest, it took almost two weeks to watch it. Not only interruptions, but the shear poverty of the individuals--the family--is overwhelming. Each member exhibits their poverty and destitution in a different way. My favorite character is Durga, who gives and gives until she reaches the point where she is tired of not receiving.I will forever remember this movie, and I hope to watch the other two parts of the trilogy.I have to have this film in my collection. Movies that make you think and think again, and search your heart for answers that sometimes never come.</p>
