<h1>Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The phrase "entertaining angels" refers to the practice of treating all guests--be they kings or peasants--as if they were visiting angels. This is the challenge for all humble Christians and the one Dorothy Day rises to meet.</p>
<p>"Entertaining Angels" is an interesting title for this movie about the 1920's and 30's social activist, Dorothy Day, for it can be regarded that what this woman did, sometimes single-handedly, always controversially, in her fight against social injustice would, indeed, be wonderful entertainment for angels... or it could mean that her work was for the benefit of the 'angels' at the bottom of the social ladder for whom she fought daily against those who would hold them down... this included her work as a suffregette. However it is meant, this film captures much of the real-life drama that took place on big city streets, and of the very personal trials which eventually led her to convert to roman Catholicism, and a dedication to helping the poor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This may be the best film no one has seen, despite the  brief but important performance of rising star Heather Graham.  {Perhaps the awkward title kept people away).  "Entertaining Angels" does what few movies have: explore inner, spiritual conflict dramatically and intelligently.  This is an engaging, challenging work for everyone.  The film overall is not preachy, yet the religious dimension here is real, just as it is real in the lives of millions of Americans, whether the Hollywood inner-circle likes it or not.</p>
