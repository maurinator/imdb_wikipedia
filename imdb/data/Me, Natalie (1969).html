<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Me, Natalie" is very much a film of two times: literally, the late 1960's (in which it takes place) and figuratively, post-adolescence, which it's heroine grapples with throughout the film.  Along the literal lines, the film sensitively deals with the generation gap during the era in which it was perhaps most severe.  Impressively, ageism is never cause for condescension in this film.  Not so impressively, a gooey Henry Mancini soundtrack and some maudlin wanna-be-romantic photography date it pretty badly.  As a coming of age story, the film is very much a contemporary of "The Sterile Cuckoo", being about a relative misfit who must find what works for her as she enters adulthood.  How one feels about these eras will invariably affect how one responds to the film.It's chief assets are it's vivid New York atmosphere and it's terrific cast. Patty Duke carries this film as effortlessly as Sandy Dennis or Natalie Wood carried earlier films of a similar nature, and she is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast.  Fans of "The Sopranos" will enjoy seeing the late Nancy Marchand, who is superb as a very different type of mother than Livia Soprano.  Martin Balsam and Elsa Lanchester are also memorable in brief appearances.  James Farentino is effective as the artist Natalie falls in love with, and Al Pacino is charismatic in his first screen role as a cad she meets at a dance.  The entire cast works beautifully, and makes a look at this film well worth while.</p>
