<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Is becoming a woman analogous, in some deep psychological way, to becoming a werewolf? Ginger is 16, edgy, tough, and, with her younger sister, into staging and photographing scenes of death. They've made a pact about dying together. In early October, on the night she has her first period, which is also the night of a full moon, a werewolf bites Ginger. Within a few days, some serious changes happen to her body and her temperament. Her sister Brigitte, 15, tries to find a cure with the help of Sam, a local doper. As Brigitte races against the clock, Halloween and another full moon approach, Ginger gets scarier, and it isn't just local dogs that begin to die.</p>
<p>Two death-obsessed sisters, outcasts in their suburban neighborhood, must deal with the tragic consequences when one of them is bitten by a deadly werewolf.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A welcome change from the usual generic American offerings, this Canadian take on moody teens and the horrors of growing up has a laid-back, low-budget feel to it. The monster looks a bit plastic-y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets.Perkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man-eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you're not too squeamish.It's not really a scary horror, although it has it's moments. The performances from the entire cast are spot-on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Isabelle sizzles and Perkins fascinates, providing the icing on a tasty if unremarkable movie.</p>
