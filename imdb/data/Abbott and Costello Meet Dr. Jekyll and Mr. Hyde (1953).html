<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The duo are in fine form. And although this isnt as good as meet Frankenstein. There is a fantastic Performance from Boris Karloff,he really is excellent in this as a man experimenting with drugs in order to get the girl he loves even though he has no chance of winning her heart.Rarely has a villain been almost sympathetic.some good chuckles as well. 8 out of 10</p>
