<h1>Forgotten Silver (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Forgotten Silver is a mockumentary which details the prodigious life of "lost" filmmaker Colin McKenzie and his incredible advances that were lost to history...until now. This supergenius filmmaker, posthumously inducted into the pantheon of cinema greats, made incredible advances in filmmaking technology, supposedly making a talkie in 1908 and using color film in 1911, but madness and poverty and the usual industry tolls drove him into obscurity.</p>
<p>Peter Jackson discovers that his elderly neighbor is the widow of Colin MacKenzie, undoubtedly cinema's most unsung auteur. Despite pioneering film effects like sound, color, and tracking shots, his monumental bad luck rendered him completely forgotten. Jackson takes it upon himself to discover the set of his biblical epic Salome, and see that this forgotten genius is given his rightful kudos.</p>
<p>The film deals with the career of a supposedly forgotten pioneer of international cinema, Colin McKenzie, who was allegedly born in rural New Zealand in 1888.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jackson pull this one great! It is not so believeable as some other mockumentaries (like "Curse of the Blair Witch") but this one is so funny and soo well done !Some scenes are obviously fake but made me laugh well :) and some are so impressive especially fake silent movies that really looks like 90 years old copies (Jackson himself can be seen as extra in some scenes in "Saloma"  oD )! They really did excelent job - I admire all efforts that was put to shoot it.Relly great and funny movie that just must be seen!10/10</p>
