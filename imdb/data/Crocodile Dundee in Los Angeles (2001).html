<h1>Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From the opening shot of a Jurassic Park-esque reptilian eye, you know you are in for a wild ride. As Mick "Crocodile" Dundee sits in a canoe sharpening his famous knife, a monstrous croc hides somewhere in the deep. The croc suddenly attacks, tearing Mick's boat to pieces and leaving him and mate Jacko up a tree. Life for Mick can only get easier, right? When Mick arrives at home, he discovers longtime companion Sue's newspaper-mogul father has called, and needs her help on an article at the paper's Los Angeles branch. Mick, who recognizes his importance in the modernizing bush is now no more than as a tourist attraction, agrees to join her, and together Mick, Sue and son Mikey head for Los Angeles. Here the adventure truly begins, as Mick and Jacko brave a cowboy bar where the horsemen are of a different color, and a Hollywood film party where everyone seems interested in Mick's mate Malcolm "Mal" Gibson's colorful exploits. Sue's article soon leads to a sleazy film producer, so Mick gets a job as a monkey wrangler at his studio, where his investigation uncovers some very sketchy goings-on.</p>
<p>Australian Outback adventurer Mick "Crocodile" Dundee travels to Los Angeles with his young son while his longtime companion suspects foul play at a movie studio.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even though its been awhile since we last seen Crocodile Dundee this movie didn't disappoint, same Paul Hogan adjusting to city life this time in LA this time with his son Mikey. Well, this third film may not be the best of the series, but still was entertaining and funny, lots of cool gags, and nothing too bad so the whole family can enjoy this one. Crocodile Dundee in L.A. wasn't bad considering it was a third sequel, I guess it was the long wait between the second and third movies that we forgot what the Crocodile was all about.</p>
