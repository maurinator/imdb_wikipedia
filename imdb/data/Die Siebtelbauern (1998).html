<h1>Die Siebtelbauern (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Austria, a little farming valley. Beginning of the century. When one of the farmers is found murdered one day, his labourers know of nothing, but are relieved, as the tyranny has ended. Then, something new happens for the first time in history: The farm workers inherit the whole farm together, as the farmer himself was childless. Now, conflicts come up, as nobody is the boss and nobody has to obey.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is not about an idealized, bucolic,  peaceful country life.  Rather it portrays the harsh  reality of the feudal system that continued n Europe  until well into the 20'th century.  Peasants were  considered "uppity" if they dared to believe they  could be the equal of Farmers, and women were so  victimized that a woman reporting her violent rape  could be sent to prison for having the audacity to  accuse her employer of a crime.  In fact, European  peasants were in many ways as ill treated as the  slaves of the Deep South.  I enjoyed this film for  its cultural realism and historical value, but the  story is quite depressing.  I rate it a 7.</p>
