<h1>Something of Value (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Even though Peter and Kimani grow up together, Kimani soon finds that different races are treated differently. After the father of Kimani is jailed for following tribal customs, Kimani joins a band of rebels that wants all non-Kenyans out of their country. While Kimani believes in the cause, he does not agree with the indiscriminate killing of women, children and those who will not join or agree with them. Peter, even after the deaths of his little sister and brother by the Mau Mau, still believes that there is a chance for peaceful co-existence. He believes that he can stop most of the killing if he can only reason with Kimani.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found this film riveting. Hudson was in his prime at this point and Poitier giving his usual brilliant best. The sub players are the best performances however. Wendy Hiller is wonderful, as usual. Such a lady. Ken Renard and Juano Hernandez are nothing less then striking. Robert Beatty is absolutely hateful. He actually makes you root for the uprising. There are some violent moments in this film, even for 1957. My only complaint is why shoot it in black and white. ALL movies taking place in Africa should be in color. Its just too beautiful for black and white. (Unless it takes place in the desert.) Richard Brooks' almost documentary style of direction has been lauded many times elsewhere and needs no more praise from me. I cant understand "edwagreen's" almost racist comments on this film. He obviously didn't see the picture I did. "The man's" wife is NOT killed and the Mau Mau do NOT march at all. (They do, however sing/chant some song).</p>
