<h1>First Men in the Moon (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the HG Wells story. The world is delighted when a space craft containing a crew made up of the world's astronauts lands on the moon, they think for the first time. But the delight turns to shock when the astronauts discover an old British flag and a document declaring that the moon is taken for Queen Victoria proving that the astronauts were not the first men on the moon. On Earth, an investigation team finds the last of the Victorian crew - a now aged Arnold Bedford and he tells them the story of how he and his girlfriend, Katherine Callender, meet up with an inventor, Joseph Cavor, in 1899. Cavor has invented Cavorite, a paste that will allow anything to deflect gravity and he created a sphere that will actually take them to the moon. Taking Arnold and accidentally taking Katherine they fly to the moon where, to their total amazement, they discover a bee-like insect population who take an unhealthy interest in their Earthly visitors...</p>
<p>Going back in time to 1899, Arnold Bedford and his fianc√©e, Kate Callendar, learn that their neighbor, Joseph Cavor, has developed a substance he calls "cavorite," which counters gravity. They travel to the moon in a spherical vessel he has built, parts of which are coated with "cavorite."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This recent DVD re-release (May, 2003) now has Dolby 4.0 stereo along with a remarkable color restoration. While not up to today's Dolby (THX) standards the soundtrack and musical score are quite good for a vintage 1964 classic. The color of this version is actually better than what I remember in the theater and much better than any TV replays (which are quite rare for this film).This was one of my all time favorite Harryhausen films as a kid and I'm glad to see it given a decent treatment to DVD. No spoilers here other than to say I still find this film as intriguing and interesting now as I did almost 40 years ago.For pure fantasy buffs and sci-fi fans "First Men in the Moon" is a fun flick to enjoy.Grab the popcorn, take the phone off the hook, and enjoy this DVD.</p>
