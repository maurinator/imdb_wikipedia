<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm with songman018.  I give it an 8 rather than a 10, but I agree with everything he said about it.  I'm shocked at how poorly this has rated among IMDB members.  I would've read some other comments to get a feel for why the average rating is below 5, but I don't want to blow my image of either the movie, or get disappointed in the people that viewed it.  I thought that it was an incredibly appealing and sensitive film and that all of the actors within were amazing.  I don't think I can say much more about it that songman didn't already cover for me.  I'm very pleased to see that someone else enjoyed it as much as I did.  Watch with an open mind and heart.</p>
