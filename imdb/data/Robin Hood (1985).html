<h1>Robin Hood (1985)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While not my favourite Robin Hood version(the Errol Flynn film) The Adventures of Robin Hood is still very enjoyable stuff. I was a little mixed on the animation quality, the forest backgrounds were well done and colourful but some of the character designs seemed stiff at times. However the music is suitably rousing, the dialogue has the wit and fun you'd associate with the Robin Hood stories and while occasionally rushed the story has some ideas that will be familiar to people and explores them in an entertaining way while also exploring all kinds of life lessons such as injustice that children and adults alike will appreciate. The characters are just as compelling, the titular character is daring and charismatic, the Sheriff suitably dastardly, Robin Hood's followers loyal and Maid Marian as lovely as you'd expect. And the voice acting is solid. On the whole, very enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox</p>
