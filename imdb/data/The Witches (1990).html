<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic ``The Witches" is a breathtaking spectacle that will delight a variety of viewers.  Anjelica Huston is simply outstanding as "The Grand High Witch."  She is the perfect actress to portray the dark, albeit laughable, character.Luke (Jasen Fisher) is a young boy living with his grandmother, Helga (Mai Zetterling).  Mai is perfectly cast as the doting, adventuresome grandmother.  Helga regales Luke with stories of witches, dangerous creatures who seek to harm children.I particularly liked the lack of Americanization in this film, as opposed to a similar counterpart, the adaptation of ``Matilda."  The film stays true to the book for the majority.  Unfortunately, the happy ending, which was loathed by Roald Dahl himself, detracts from the seemingly perfect adaptation.In any event, 'The Witches' is sure to be a hit among kids (and adults as well).  Anyone who has enjoyed the book is sure to enjoy this film version.</p>
