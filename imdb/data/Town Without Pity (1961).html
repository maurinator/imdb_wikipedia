<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was all in all a great film, with riveting performances from all the cast. My problem was the weak,ineffective score, which took a great theme song and beat it like a dead horse. The opening scene and credits placed the song well, but the frequent, unrelenting repeat of the theme both instrumental and with Gene Pitney's great vocals throughout the film in quite inappropriate places "isn't very pretty" at all. Very distracting to the viewer, and certainly took away some of the film's impact.The rest of the score was passable, but nothing special. I think the intended tone of the film could have been maintained or even intensified if there were no further music in the film after the song ran with the opening credits.</p>
