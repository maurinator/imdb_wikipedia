<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alan is a Seattle college student volunteering at a crisis center. One night when at the clinic alone, a woman calls up the number and tells Alan that she needs to talk to someone. She informs Alan she took a load of pills, and he secretly tries to get help. During this time, he learns more about the woman, her family life, and why she wants to die. Can Alan get the cavalry to save her in time before it's too late?</p>
<p>Allan Newell is a Seattle university student who works at a phone-in crisis clinic. The calls he receives are for the most part routine - an unhappy barber who feels he gets no respect, for example - but he then gets a call from a suicidal woman, Inga,who claims to have already taken an overdose of barbiturates. Through flashbacks, we learn of the events that have led her to attempt to take her own life. Her husband learned that their child is not his and her marriage is on rocky ground. As the telephone company attempts to trace the call and the police try to locate her, Allen works desperately to keep her on the line.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw it years ago (because they don't show it anymore) and I loved it. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I am not such a big fan of drama, but this mixture of drama and suspense, coupled with a touching homage to the selflessness and compassion of the suicide prevention workers, is simply breathtaking. I also liked the fact that race is never an issue, yet it does loom between the lines (she can't see his color, so, in what sense does it even exist?). Bancroft and Poitier are among my favorite stars because so many of their films are so good. I always want to know: what role does an actor have in selecting his movie roles? Actors are - I hope - not only actors, but selectors of roles. That is a critical role, because there is no good acting in a bad movie.</p>
