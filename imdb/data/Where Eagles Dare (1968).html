<h1>Where Eagles Dare (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During WW2 a British aircraft is shot down and crashes in Nazi held territory. The Germans capture the only survivor, an American General, and take him to the nearest SS headquarters. Unknown to the Germans the General has full knowledge of the D-Day operation. The British decide that the General must not be allowed to divulge any details of the Normandy landing at all cost and order Major John Smith to lead a crack commando team to rescue him. Amongst the team is an American Ranger, Lieutenant Schaffer, who is puzzled by his inclusion in an all British operation. When one of the team dies after the parachute drop, Schaffer suspects that Smith's mission has a much more secret objective.</p>
<p>Several months before D-Day, the British stage a daring rescue deep inside Germany. Led by British Major Jonathan Smith and including one American, Lt. Morris Schaffer, their mission is to rescue American Brig. Gen. George Carnaby whose airplane was shot down over Germany. Carnaby, one of the architects of the D-Day invasion, is being held in the Schloss Adler, the Eagle's Castle, built high on a promontory and accessible only by cable car. The team successfully parachutes into Germany but lose their radioman in the jump and then a second member of the team within a day. Taken prisoner by the Germans, Smith's true mission is revealed.</p>
<p>In 1944, an American General is shot down over a heavily defended German fortress and imprisoned within. A rescue attempt is at once launched by British Intellegence, since the General must be liberated before being made to reveal Allied plans for an invasion of France. As the mission unfolds, however, double and triple agents begin to appear in the ranks of the rescue team with the added mystery of an American Lieutenant assigned to the mission for reasons unknown.</p>
<p>Allied agents stage a daring raid on a castle where the Nazis are holding an American General prisoner... but that's not all that's really going on.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Once a year, usually around Christmas time but always in winter, this movie is played somewhere on British TV.  Like 'The Great Escape' this movie has become a staple of TV station classic war movies wheeled out once a year to keep the punters happy, and it always delivers.How can it fail?  It has spectacular scenery, great actors, lots of schoolboy WWII style action and even busty wenches in maid uniforms.  This film is ingrained in the psyche, you cannot see a mountaintop castle without thinking of Schloss Adler and the cable-car scenes.  If I'm trudging through the snow in the woods then I hear myself humming the theme from 'Where Eagles Dare'.  If I or anyone from my generation picks up a radio, it's only a matter of time before someone starts sending "Broadsword calling Danny Boy" in an imitation of Richard Burton's plummy tones.  It's a given.I know it's not the most realistic movie ever made, but Richard Burton, Michael Horden, Clint Eastwood and the gang carry it off with great aplomb and we believe every line.  The pacing is excellent, leaving similar offerings such as 'Guns of Navarone' feeling like funeral marches.  And talk about atmosphere!  This movie reeks atmosphere, from the settings in the beautiful mountains to the scenes inside the old caste hallways to the exterior shots of people rapelling down the sides of the viciously cold walls.  It's a must see, 8 out of 10 compared to all films, and 10 out of 10 for 'men on a mission' movies.</p>
