<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just watched this on HBO this morning. I had never heard of it before , and was curious.  Despite the opportunity for extreme corn, most of the flick is really engaging.  It seems like it ought to be a lame Disney movie, with the kid and the injured dog, but it has cussing and violence.  I was pleased to see Travolta playing a loser.  Usually if he's not the hero, he's a ridiculous melodramatic villain.   He's usually too smug for my taste, but in this (Probably a reflection on the state of his career at the time) his character is pathetic for most of the movie.  The villains are not original, but I really liked the little girl.  For the most part, it is surprisingly good. Until you get to the end.  The end of this movie is so completely lame, you will kick yourself for sitting through the whole thing.  They really, really dropped the ball with that stupid, illogical, unrealistic ending.  Ucccch!!!  I would recommend just turning it off right before the dogfight at the end.  Imagine something cooler happened instead.  Trust me, whatever you can come up with in 30 seconds will be better than the crap these people thought up.  I would really be interested in knowing who came up with that ending.  Test audiences?  Studio people?  Travolta?  The director?  If that was what the writer originally wrote, I will eat my shoe.</p>
