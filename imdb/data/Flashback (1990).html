<h1>Flashback (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1989, clean-cut FBI man John Buckner is detailed to escort heavily-bearded Huey Walker back to jail for offenses dating back to his days as a celebrated hippie radical. After Walker dupes Buckner on the train he falls into the hands of a couple of well-meaning refugees from the 60's, the two men with apparently nothing in common find themselves on the run together. But appearances can be deceptive.</p>
<p>The young FBI agent John Buckner is instructed to bring Huey Walker, a hippie from the sixties, to prison. They travel by train, and of course, Huey tries to escape. John loses his freedom and his identity through one of Huey's tricks: He plies him with drink and takes his gun, his handcuffs and his passport. Now John ends up in jail instead of Huey... When the mistake is discovered, John sets off in pursuit of Huey.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those all around great films that anyone can enjoy.  When I was young I thought it was really funny.  Now I get all the deeper messages and plot details, and like the movie all the more for it.  This is also one of the two movies that can make me cry.  The other is Grave of the Fireflies. The other aspects of the film, besides plot, are great too.  The characters play off each other really well.  The filming is good, and the comedy doesn't compromise the more serious nature of the film.</p>
