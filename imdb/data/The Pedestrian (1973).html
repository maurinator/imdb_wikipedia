<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is about a man who committed a terrible crime during war and is now old and somehow sorry for what he did. The story about the preparations for his trial are described from different points of view, also from his.It's interesting to experience Maximilian Schell mainly as a director. (The role he plays in the film is quite small.) Shades of grey dominate the film. It looks like made with a low budget in a studio with minimum scenery. Although the story is really interesting and the topic is controversial  shall an old, harmless man still be called to account for the crimes he committed a long time ago in war?  somehow the film doesn't keep awake. There are some surprising takes here and charming guest appearances there  there seems to be no continuity, no concept. The film seems undirected`, uncoordinated. I guess, that's a common problem, when actors, who believe they know their way around, try and direct a movie.The movie ends abruptly, after changing into a TV discussion. I got the impression that the film had been over for minutes and I was watching that discussion. Really weird.</p>
