<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The writers Clement / LaFrenais (The Commitments / Still Crazy) have made a funny satire of the end of the british colonialism in the Thatcher-Era (2 years after the Falkland Conflict) and about TV and commerce.Michael Caine gives a great performance as the Gouvernor of the island.The rest of the cast is extraordinary, especially the comedian Billy Connolly (Mrs. Brown / Still Crazy) as leader of the 2-Men- Guerilla-Group of the island.The film contains some good reggae-songs of the 80Â´s Reggae-Pop-Grandmaster Eddy Grant and some others.A tip for all, who wanna have sun & fun for 100 minutes !(Translated by my sister Antonia)</p>
