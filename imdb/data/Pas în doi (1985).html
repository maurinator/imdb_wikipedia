<h1>Pas în doi (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A park, inside a city. A factory. A building of unmarried people. A night at the disco. Two friends, closer than brothers, working together, staying in the same room, playing together. One - delicate, heart wide, generous and shy, the other - with a special charisma, irresistible, different from others. The first is hopelessly in love with a woman who is raising her child alone. The other seems to fall in love with a beautiful young girl, until she falls for his friend's girl, and he responds with the same love. He continues to love the both girls, because in each of them he sees something else. Where does the truth ends and lie begin? Where friendship ends and love begins? In the pursuit of happiness, everything is permitted? With detachment and irony, amid Adrian Enescu's extraordinary music, in this masterpiece Dan Pita manages to build for the first time in a Romanian film, a true and fascinating story of the young workers.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Big movieWhat can you do when you love two girls? Sincerely, with all your hard, truly but love two girls.It's a story about love. It's a story about couple, about how a large group of teenagers became small families. It's a story about a rebel, with a cause, a rebel who cannot decide between a pure, innocent (and blonde) burning love and a docile, peaceful, quiet and  hopeless love. A story about a young, blonde, innocent girl who fight for she's love and a quiet, hopeless and lonely young mother which can't hope that she's colleague will accept not only her but she's whole life which include other's man kid. Love is all around, under different forms and finally, love is the subject, love is the plot, and love is the end. Such a story cannot have happy-end. Beyond all, it is to mentioned that after release, the movie had to fight with communist censors and not because it is a very-clear anticommunist movie but only because the young character was not in "the line of the party". It was  I guess  an year or a little more until the movie was pull off from the Romanian theaters. PAS IN DOI = STEPS IN TWO. Steps in pairs? Steps in couple? Steps in the second place? Steps to the two targets? I guess it's only steps of life .</p>
