<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I expected something interesting and I was served a bowl of sweet soup with good ingredients but no real flavour.Historically the backdrop is quite accurate but the spectator never really enters this movie which revolves around a love affair and not around the war. The Caporetto disaster could have been explained a bit more and one could have done without those harrowing scenes of gushing love. The court martial thing is a farce and acting is moderately interesting.Disappointment for sure.</p>
