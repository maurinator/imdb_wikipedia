<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>By 1988, it seemed that audiences couldn't get enough of Freddy Krueger. The first three films made a lot of money, which led to merchandising up the wazoo. He was a household name and it was only the beginning. 'The Dream Master' was the most successful of the series up to that point. So naturally the folks at New Line got started on the next chapter. It came less than a year after 4 and didn't perform as well as what came before. All these years later though, it actually holds up well.Pros: A great and creepy opening sequence. Above average performances. One of the best scores in the series. A welcome return to a darker atmosphere. Nicely done effects. Eye-popping production design. Creative death scenes. Some cool ideas, such as how Freddy gets to his victims this time. Moves at a good pace.Cons: Like the last film, this one's plot is real thin. Brings up some serious issues, then drops them. Though shown less, Freddy isn't as scary as in the earlier films.Final thoughts: Like 'Halloween 5,' this sequel was rushed into production after it's predecessor's success. Had they given the audience a longer break from Ol' Freddy, it may have done better at the Box Office. Despite this and it's faults, this installment is one of the series' strongest. From the spectacle, to the likable cast, to the darker tone and the chilling score it's a treat. Too bad they had to blow it with the next one, but that's another story.My rating: 4/5</p>
