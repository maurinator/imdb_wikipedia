<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The 1981 version of Body and Soul,unlike the 1947 version that won an Oscar,lacked credibility and depth. The 1981 fighter just wasn't as believable and was more ostentatious in the bedroom than he was in the ring! Come on give me something that I can feel, like in the movie Raging Bull! After all Robert Dinero was a lover and a fighter but at least you felt his pain, his pride and his love and hate for women. Body and Soul 1981, with Leon Kennedy,gave us none of the sort. There was no body and there definitely was no soul. We all left the theater empty wondering where is the fight, who is it with, and who is the the champ! You had plenty of heart Leon,but you definitely lacked Soul!</p>
