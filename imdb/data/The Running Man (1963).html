<h1>The Running Man (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hard up and with a grudge against insurance companies, Rex Black feigns his death and meets up with his wife and the money in Malaga when things seemed to have quietened down. But when the insurance investigator from the claim also turns up Rex starts a game of cat-and-mouse.</p>
<p>Rex Black was the owner/operator of his own one plane air transport company based in Croydon, England. He died in a glider accident off the coast of England, his body which was never recovered. In reality, he faked his own death in order for his wife, Stella Black, to collect on his life insurance policy. The Blacks orchestrated this scheme to get back at the Excelsior Insurance Company, which denied them insurance payment when Rex's plane crashed and burned since his insurance policy expired by two days, either by Rex's error on forgetting a payment or having the mail delay the renewal payment. He figured the insurance company owes them for ruining their livelihood. Their plan, which evolves as it goes along, is for Stella to collect the moneys, Rex to assume another identity in Málaga Spain where the two will rendezvous, Stella to arrange for the moneys to be deposited and converted into draft form that they can access from anywhere in the world, and them to travel elsewhere where they can start their life anew. Stealing a passport of a tourist in Málaga, Rex assumes the identity of Jim Jerome, an Australian sheep farmer. But things change when Stella becomes more concerned about being with Rex than ensuring their plan is foolproof, and Rex veers in the opposite direction, seemingly becoming fixated on the moneys and being addicted to what he sees as easy money in defrauding insurance companies. These two issues become all the more important when Stephen Maddux, the Excelsior investigator working on Rex's policy claim, arrives in Málaga. Rex and Stella have to find out if he is on to them, if it is all coincidence, or if he is in Málaga for some other purpose. Rex and Stella will also have to decide how far they will go if indeed Stephen is tailing them to reclaim the insurance moneys.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Rex and Stella Black" (Laurence Harvey and Lee Remick) are launching a scheme to defraud 50,000 pounds to an insurance company. "Rex" fakes his death in a plane crash, changes appearance, and using a stolen passport, flies to Spain, where he meets Stella. The personality of "Rex" begins to change, a situation exacerbated by the arrival of "Stephen" (Alan Bates), a young insurance investigator who gets nervous. "Stella", scared, tries to seduce him to remove the danger, but "Rex", convinced that "Stephen" has discovered the fraud, attempts to remove him.We can say that "The Running Man" is not among the best films of director Carol Reed, but if it has that touch of quality that guarantees at least good entertainment and a good time. The cast features Laurence Harvey, Lee Remick and Alan Bates, this acts as the heavy agent of the insurance company. It has an entertaining story and good management scenarios filmed in Spanish, where we can see some extraordinary landscapes and some beautiful places of southern Spain.Among the supporting cast we see high quality Spanish players like Fernando Rey and Juanjo Menéndez.</p>
