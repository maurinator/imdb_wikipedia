<h1>Romanoff and Juliet (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A "Romeo and Juliet"-inspired Cold War satire starring, written and directed by Peter Ustinov. A tiny but otherwise inconsequential and powerless European country called Concordia holds the deciding vote in a crucial United Nations resolution. As the U.S. and Soviet Union try to manipulate Condordia so that its vote aligns with their interests, Concordia's wily leader (Ustinov) turns the tables on the superpowers, pitting one against the other by playing matchmaker between the son of the Soviet ambassador and the daughter of his US counterpart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We live in a world where politics and agendas influence every facet of our lives. This gentle satire isn't just one about the Cold War, it's about diplomacy in any age at any time.Ustinov had a unique sense of humor which is evident in this movie. What makes it special is that there is an overwhelming sense of romance in the film too. The running gag line in the movie (we/they know they/we know we/they know their code) comes to my mind in nearly every espionage film I see. I always want to turn to friends and say the line, but as this film has had such limited exposure in the last few decades, I know no one else will get the joke. Why isn't this movie available on DVD???</p>
