<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Crap, Crap, ...Mega-Crap It pretends to be an homage (un/intentional) to the Coen Brothers ... done poorly.There is no real mystery to the plot.Diaz's performance is totally uninspired.The quirky characters don't really work.There are a lot of "duh" moments.I love black comedy, but this film isn't funny.In my view, it wasn't worth the electricity.There are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining.I hope you find this review helpful.</p>
