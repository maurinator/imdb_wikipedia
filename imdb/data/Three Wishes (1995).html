<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Certainly a mixed bag of comments on this one.  I'm definitely one of this film's boosters.  I saw it long ago on a motel tv in the middle of the night and have never forgotten it.  My memory was that it was an 80s movie; I suppose because most of the plot was set in the 50s.  When I rediscovered that it was made as late as 1995 I was quite surprised.  The fact that women directors and writers were so heavily involved with this movie explains its beautiful emotional resonance.  Even now as I write this I'm again deeply moved by the whole story and its telling.  To me it's right up there with films like "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Miracle on 34th Street," etc.  Recently TCM has been featuring great women screen writers like Frances Marion and April Guy Blache.  I'm glad to discover that women are still and again strongly contributing to our collective screen world of emotions and feelings.  Too bad this sensitive approach seems to turn some of your reviewers strongly off.  Perhaps it's a gender thing.</p>
