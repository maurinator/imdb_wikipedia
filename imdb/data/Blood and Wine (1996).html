<h1>Blood and Wine (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bob Rafelson has stated that this is the final part of an informal trilogy he started with "Five Easy Pieces" and continued with "The King Of Marvin Gardens". In the three, Nicholson has now played son, brother and father. In this one, Nicholson is a wealthy wine dealer who has distanced himself from his wife with his philandering and from his son with his negligence. After he steals a diamond necklace with the help of a safecracker partner, Victor, things start coming apart. His wife sets out to interrupt what she thinks is another one of his weekend dalliances, but is really his trip to pawn the jewels.</p>
<p>A man who has failed as a father and husband commits a heist to make money for his fledging business, but things become complicated when his wife interferes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>With the talent on board, Jack Nicholson, Michael Cane, Jennifer Lopez, and Stephen Dorff, "Blood and Wine" must be regarded as a misfire. The film seems strangely detached, with no real involvement for the audience. Jennife Lopez especially comes across as if she wasn't sure how to present herself. What you get are domestic disputes, disappearing diamonds, and disagreements among thieves, none of which are particularly interesting. Even the heist is depicted as an afterthought. With no likable characters, a script that seems underdeveloped, and little reason for the viewer to care about any of this, everything just sort of drifts along to nowhere. - MERK</p>
