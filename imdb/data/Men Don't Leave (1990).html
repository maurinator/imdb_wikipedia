<h1>Men Don't Leave (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A mother of two sons finds life considerably difficult on her own after the death of her beloved husband. Due to debt she must move them to Baltimore, and deal with the hardships and all that comes with the city life.</p>
<p>After her husband John dies unexpectedly, Beth Macauley is unprepared for life without him. She is unemployed with no job skills and $60,000 in debt from on-going renovations to their house located in suburban Bingham. She doesn't know what to do but sell what material possessions she has, such as the family pick-up truck and the house, and move into an apartment in the city, namely Baltimore. None of these actions sit well with her two sons, seventeen year old Chris and nine year old Matty, but they don't seem to have a choice. Once in the city, Matty, with his new slightly delinquent friend Winston Buckley, aims to help his mother buy back their house. Chris' main goals are to stop anyone from replacing his father, especially divorced Charles Simon, a musician in an experimental music orchestra who is interested in Beth, and to get to know Jody better, she the slightly older and straightforward nurse who lives in their apartment building. And Beth just wants to survive by finding a job she doesn't dislike, and keep her family together while trying to maintain her sanity and sense of self-worth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is certainly an exception. A remake from the French version "Hot Air Balloon", this film has many noteworthy aspects to it, including the excellent cast of Arliss Howard, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Lange's troubled son Chris O'Donnell.Primarily Lange is a widower who has to sell her house and start over. She moves to a small apartment in Baltimore with her two children, who are not happy about it. She eventually finds work (there are some amusing scenes) for a catering company, owned by Kathy Bates (always a memorable character, in this case the tyrannical boss).Joan Cusack also adds humor to the latter half, having met O'Donnell, she starts dating him, Lange at first over-protective, then gradually becomes friends with Cusack. Cusack, as a therapeutic gesture, takes her on a hot air balloon. A seemingly silly gesture, but a metaphor for starting over. Well-done and never depressing, an excellent film worth viewing. 9/10.</p>
