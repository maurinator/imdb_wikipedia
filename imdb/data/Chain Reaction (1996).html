<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Steeped in the Directorial sensibilities of the 90's Chain Reaction is a well made movie with an intriguing plot and appealing storyline.The movie basically epitomises the life and breadth of all the action thrillers produced in the 90's. I loved them all.Unlike their 21st century counterparts , they don't excel in realism or cold and brutal portrayal of duels . But their is something which qualifies them as entertainers .Chain Reaction is that 90's movie.Keannu Reeves and Morgan Freeman play their parts in this nicely directed film. Tenacious henchmen with the bad guy look written all over their faces, the cool and foxy villain with a suave demeanour, the unassuming,raw , innocent yet determined good guys , an impending disaster involving a " Chain Reaction" and more than a 100 hours of proper 90's entertainment.</p>
