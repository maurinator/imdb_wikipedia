<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a classic!  Everybody knows that!  I remember seeing the original Homeward Bound (it was called "The Incredible Journey") and it basically was the exact same story this one is, only more bland.  I hated that narrator that told us the whole story.  With this version, however the story is told by the animals that lived the adventure.  That's what makes this story interesting and worthwhile, when you see the characters and the plot from a different point of view.Chance, an American bulldog (Michael J. Fox), Sassy, a Himalayan cat (Sally Field), and Shadow, a golden retriever (Don Ameche) must find their way across the Californian mountains and valleys in search of the family that loves them.  No journey is without its conflicts and there are some that each take a toll on the main characters.Another perfect Disney show--it easily scored a 8 out of 10 for me.  If you're considering watching the sequel, don't bother.  It doesn't have the magic or personality this one does and Shadow sounds nothing like he used to (I think Don Ameche died before they made the second one).</p>
