<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is movie from a different era - reminds you of the times when the values were different. Joint family and obeying elders were the norm and individuality would take a back seat. Rekha challenges the joint family rules and brings in a fresh breath of life to the stifled family members. Values and lifestyles are changing, albeit slowly, and this movie reminds you of the days when you had fun with such simple thingsRekha and all the cast members do an excellent job in this movie. The characterization is such that you get to know every member of the family. This is one of the best of the simple clean movies of 80's</p>
