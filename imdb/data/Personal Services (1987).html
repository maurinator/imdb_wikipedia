<h1>Personal Services (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the rise of a madame of a suburban brothel catering to older men, inspired by the real experiences of Cynthia Payne.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Loved this movie. Some of the scenes make you squirm. Some unpleasant surprises that are somehow funny. Can't help but like the characters - especially the military man who needs some mahogany polished.</p>
