<h1>The Day After (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The frightening story of the weeks leading up to and following a nuclear strike on the United States. The bulk of the activity centers around the town of Lawrence, Kansas.</p>
<p>It is the mid-1980s. An aggressive Soviet leadership orders troops marched to the border of West Berlin, and then decides to invade West Germany with multiple armored tank & troop divisions. In Lawrence, Kansas - on the border with Missouri - a family is preparing for the wedding of their eldest daughter, and Dr. Oakes is keeping busy in his role as chief of surgery in the small University Hospital at Lawrence. These people go on with their daily lives but are drawn closer to the possibility of a nuclear war, as the Russians use a nuclear ballistic missile against a West German city, and then attack a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf. The Americans strike back by hitting a Soviet ship, and then the Russians hit NATO regional headquarters with a nuclear warhead! People start creating makeshift fallout shelters in their basements, but many are caught off guard when, 1 at a time, nuclear missiles are launched from their silos along the Kansas - Missouri border. USAF officers then announce that 300+ ICBMs are inbound to the U.S., and 2 of them strike Kansas City, Missouri! Many are killed outright, but still more must face the danger of radioactive fallout. Now, the characters we follow are living in a barren, devastated world - devoid of electricity, safe drinking water, and food - and filled with radioactivity, starvation, and disease... in the horrific aftermath of 'The Day After'...</p>
<p>A graphic, disturbing film about the effects of a devastating nuclear holocaust on small-town residents of eastern Kansas.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you think this movie's theme is outdated, think again.  The Doomsday Clock has moved ahead three times since the end of the Cold War.  From a press release:  "Chicago, February 27, 2002: Today, the Board of Directors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moves the minute hand of the `Doomsday Clock,' the symbol of nuclear danger, from nine to seven minutes to midnight, the same setting at which the clock debuted 55 years ago. Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, this is the third time the hand has moved forward."I watched this movie again a few weeks ago, after seeing it on TV as a ten-year-old kid.  While some of the story-lines were painful (e.g. the soon-to-be-wed farmer's daughter whining when dad caught her sneaking off to have sex) this was a well-done movie showing the effects of nuclear war on middle america.While maybe you can knock this for it's dramatic quality, I think it holds together as an honest story.  Some of the criticisms I've read below don't hold together.  The story *is* clear about the effects that happen at different distances from ground-zero.  The Russians nailed Kansas because of the missile silos there.  And it is honest about human nature: in the aftermath lots of people help, like the doctor, but others kill for food or land and there's plenty of panic and anger to go around.This movie made an impression on me when I saw it as a kid and also now as an adult.  And for those out there knocking it--remember this:  The Day After made the people of the United States realize what kind of horrible toys their leaders are dealing with.  It sparked the movement against nukes. We need a similar movement today--because people have forgotten, or don't think nuclear weapons are a threat.  But the United States is now researching new, tactical nukes which, if smaller, will still result in fallout poisoning people unlucky to be in the neighborhood.  Just like the kids in Iraq that get to breath the Uranium dust from our tank-busting weapons.I wish we had more movies like this, and like _Traffic_, that bring painful realities to life and make people think.</p>
