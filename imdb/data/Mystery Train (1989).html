<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this movie, yet it's hard to say exactly why.  It was very realistic in it's overall story line yet very original in the way it presented it.  The actors almost appeared real in that one was just observing them in real life.  I think that was because of the story line, script and direction.  Also this entire movie is like a well thought out three-act play that takes place all at the same time.  It is cleverly connected and dramatically effective at getting the viewer's interest in these character interactions over this one night period of time in Memphis.   Attention to detail was as good as it could get.If you are big fan of very high quality and original indie films you should not miss this one.  It has the makings of a true classic.</p>
