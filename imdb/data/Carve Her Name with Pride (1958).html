<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pardon me for beginning this way, but is this movie a copied storyline of the earlier film "Odette" (1951)? Both stories seem to run so parallel one can only wonder about it. On second thoughts perhaps not. We ought to realize how many dedicated people with strong convictions made the great sacrifice during the war. Violette Szabo (Virginia McKenna), as an appealing spy, felt duty bound to assist her country and was one of them who left all personal thought behind to do her duty. It's very dramatic and riveting as she faces the many dangers.Really, Virginia McKenna gave a strong performance, very deserving of an Oscar, I'd say. War isn't glorious by any means. A serious film.</p>
