<h1>BabaKiueria (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Role reversal study of the historically inaccurate "plight" of Australian Aborigines in modern Anglo-Saxon society. Indigenous "whities" [sic] are being persecuted by racist black people who invaded the fictitious country of BabaKiueria. Politically incorrect and inconvenient facts about infant mortality rates are ignored by a "reporter" who lives with a typical white family in a white "ghetto" for six months.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Babakiueria, written by Geoffrey Atherden, details the very clever role reversal of Australian (anglo-saxon) history.  I indeed enjoyed this film for both its witty dialogue and the political message underlying it.  I first watched this in my yr 12 Drama class, and I was compelled by the writing, and how the screenwriter, Atherden, has managed such a difficult theme as Australian - Aboriginal relations, and made it so clearly understandable by even the most arrogant of bigots...but I use that term loosely. There are many films out today that attempt to parody certain aspects of modern life: ie, scary movie, american beauty, best of show, spy hard - yet all of these films are not true to their message entirely, they renounce their opinions shortly after making them simply because this is "safe". In 'babakiueria', the entire team behind the film have honestly felt the passion of the aboriginal's plight and have made an entirely true, and thoroughly honest satire of the modern struggle for possession in Australia. It is necessary for there to be many more films such as this in the world, and less movies that simply "make the jokes" to entertain and not inform.  I personally found it incredibly liberating to view myself (as a european of origin) and my people in this movie in the lower status - viewing my society as the oppressed.  It makes you wonder as to how you would really cope in that scenario of oppression.</p>
