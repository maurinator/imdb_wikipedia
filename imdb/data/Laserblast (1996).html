<h1>Laserblast (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Doctor Forrester's funding has been cut off, and as he waits for the Satellite of Love to crash, he sends Mike and the Bots Laserblast (1978). Can our heroes escape to the edge of the Universe? More importantly, can they figure out why Leonard Maltin gave the film 2Â½ stars?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I would've given "Laserblast" the benefit of the doubt based solely on its sweet title. Sadly, that is something this movie does not live up to (haha, Maltin gave this turkey 2-and-a-half stars). But it does make for a kickass MST3K.Mike and the bots are here with knives sharpened for this blazing piece of incompetence. The main character (geez, that guy's a pitiful douche), the hick stereotype Sheriff's deputy, the inept direction. The movie's awful, but the jokes land beautifully. More than that, the wit seems to kick into overdrive during the film's second half (in which Mike shows up in drag, giving you an idea as to the level of derangement here).But I do wish that title wasn't wasted on this pile.8/10</p>
