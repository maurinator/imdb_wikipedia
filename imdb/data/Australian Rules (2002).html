<h1>Australian Rules (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Prospect Bay, a remote outpost on the South Australian coast, two communities, the Goonyas and the Nungas, come together on the one field they have in common, the football field. But the underlying racism and class warfare threatens to make the team's greatest victories irrelevant. This holds particularly true for Blacky, a white teen who is more interested in books than sport, and his best friend, Dumby, the Aboriginal star of the team.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Australian Rules is probably one of the hardest movies I have ever watched. It was up there with Hotel Rowanda and Ragging Bull. This movie deals with the underlying racial issues in Austrlia, between the Aboriginals and the whites. It does a great job at making you the audience feel the tensions and injustices cause to the aboriginals by racism. It is extremely depressing, so make sure you are in a happy mood before you watch it. Even thought it is so depressing it is a must see if you are an Austrlian, I feel. I am an American but, currently living in Australia, watching this film will give you an understanding about the wrongs of racism no matter what country you live in.</p>
