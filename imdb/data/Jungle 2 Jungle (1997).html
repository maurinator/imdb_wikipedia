<h1>Jungle 2 Jungle (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A New York commodities broker who was married several years ago has been separated from his wife. Now he wants to marry his new girlfriend, so he has to divorce her first. So he goes to Venezuela, and is brought deep into the jungle and told that when they separated she was pregnant and chose not to tell him since he stated he was not really interested in becoming a father. Today, the boy has reached the age where he has to go on a quest, in New York, so his father reluctantly brings him along, and a culture clash follows. The boy has spent all of his life with the tribe he grew up with, and his father has a bit of problem so he can't spent as much as time with his son as his son likes.</p>
<p>A New Yorker suddenly learns he has a thirteen-year-old son who's been raised in the jungle. He brings the boy to New York City, and that's where the fun starts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are two surprising things about "Jungle 2 Jungle". The first is that amazingly, this is not a sequel, but actually a remake of a French film (unlike "Journey 2: the Mysterious Island" or "2 Fast, 2 Furious" which are sequels). The second surprise is that this is nothing more than a lame family comedy. Even if you had lived your entire life in a jungle and had never seen a film before, '"Jungle 2 Jungle" would be recognized as a predictable pile of lizard guts. This family film is not funny, believable or touching and the characters will make you cringe. I heard the original isn't very good and unsurprisingly, neither is this movie. (On VHS, January 2012)</p>
