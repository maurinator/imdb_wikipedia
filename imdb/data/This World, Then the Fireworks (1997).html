<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How in the world can you guys not like this film.  I consider this film one of my top 10, mostly because the characterization of Billy Zane's character may be the best in any movie ever. This movies has almost everything you want: Original Awesome Characterization (especially with Zane's Character) Sufficiently well written and actedMaybe this movie isn't what the mainstream wants, but it is still an excellent flick.</p>
