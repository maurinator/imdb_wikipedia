<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eugene is an extraordinary talent in classic guitar, but he dreams of being a famous Blues guitarist. So he investigates to find a storied lost song. He asks the legendary Blues musician Willie Brown to help him, but Willie demands to free him from the old-people's prison first and to really learn the blues on the way to its origin: Mississippi Delta. Eugene doesn't know yet about Willie's deal with the devil, that he now wants to revoke.</p>
<p>Eugene Martone, the "Lightening Boy", is a lover of blues. He studies guitar in Julliard, but he indeed is looking for the thirtieth unknown song of Roberto Johnson. One day, he meets Willie Brown, the "Blind Dog" in an old folk's home and is convinced that he possess the lost song. Eugene helps Willie to escape the asylum and goes with him to Mississippi. They can just afford a bus ticket from New York to half way to Mississippi, so the rest of their journey is hitchhiking. In the way, they meet Frances, a girl who left home and wishes to be a dancer in Los Angeles. They three together pass through many strange adventures and situations, and the climax is the guitar duel between Eugene and Jack Butler.</p>
<p>Ralph Macchio is Lightning Boy. A kid who can make a slide guitar sing. Blind Dog is an old pro who knows it. Together, they're headed to a place where deals are made. And legends are born.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Walter Hill is the director of some of my all time favorite movies.  His films tend to be more action oriented, rather than character-driven, which is surprising since I normally don't like action films.  He tends to establish the characters just enough for you to care about them before throwing them headfirst into the fireworks.  Movies like "The Warriors", "48 Hours", "Southern Comfort", and "The Long Riders" all left their mark and set standards for their genre.  It's a little strange that he would sign on to do a movie like this, but he somehow pulls it off.  This kid Eugene (Ralph Macchio) is a classical guitar student with an obsession with the blues.  Despite the disapproval of his teacher, he longs to be a bluesman just like his heros of the 30s and 40s.  When he gets word of a lost song by the late, great Robert Johnson, he hunts down Johnson's still-living harp player, Willie Brown (Joe Seneca).  Willie is a cantankerous old man who spends his days rotting away down at the nursing home.  It doesn't take the kid long to track down the old man and make a little deal:  If he helps the  geezer bust out of the old-folks home, then the geezer will in turn, teach the kid the long lost song.  You see, they're in New York and the old man has to get home to  the delta to settle an old score. Thus, the road trip begins...hobo-style.  To give much more away would be a crime, but the kid and the geezer are well matched and this gives the movie a lot of laughs and LOADS of memorable quotes from the old man. Joe Seneca was a great actor and I believe this was one of his best performances.  Ralph Macchio is perfect as the kid and we really do believe that he is obsessed with the blues.  Jami Gertz also gives a credible performance as the temporary love interest.  She's perfect for the part.  I really can't praise this movie enough.  The music alone, is enough to reccommend it (Ry Cooder rocks as always) and if you're into the blues, chances are you've already seen it.  If you can find this one, it's well worth a rental.  I guarantee that you won't watch it just once.  I can't wait for the dvd.  10/10</p>
