<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is pretty darn old. I think it says here it was released in 1965. Anyhow, I've never really considered myself much of Tim Conway fan and my memories of the series centered on how silly it was. Well, I'm a heckuva lot older now and I can appreciate silly a lot better now. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times while watching this earlier today on AMC. I'm pretty positive no film displays the comic genius of Tim Conway better than this one. I was reminded a lot of the three stooges, Conway, Joe Flynn, and the guy playing Elroy almost steal the stooges act completely. The physical comedy is a hoot. I would love to have a DVD of this one and some other McHale's Navy stuff. Borgnine doesn't make it but that only gives more time for Conway and Flynn to just go off. The plot is very above average also, lots of twists and goofy situations for the boys to work their magic with. I know lots of people will pass on this movie because its old school, black and white, no bad language, and done in the classic style. But check this out, if you have an interest in comedy and you want to watch some of the best do it right...don't miss this one. Conway's love interest is a very pretty girl by the way...I don't recall ever seeing her before..super cute! The actors playing the "big brass" are all very good also. The boyfriend from THAT GIRL also has a nice part in this one. Give McHale's Navy joins the Air Force a look. It's just as funny as Norbit and there is no pointless vulgarity or pimp stuff. (not that I personally object to that stuff)</p>
