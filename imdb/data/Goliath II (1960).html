<h1>Goliath II (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Goliath II is a 6-inch-tall elephant (son of the huge Goliath). He's a big disappointment to his father, but mom is proud of Goliath II anyway. Goliath II is constantly getting into trouble because he's so small. In particular, the tiger Raja looks for every opportunity to try a bite-size taste of elephant. After one incident where he ran away and his mother scolded him, he runs away. After he's rescued, the rest of the elephants are terrified of a mouse, but Goliath II stands his ground.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very nice animated short in many ways, not one of the best Disney shorts but one of the more underrated ones. The animation style is not going to please everyone, with me it was a case of parts being good and others not so much. The colours are vibrant, mostly though with some flat spots, and the characters are mostly very well drawn, but the backgrounds are rather rough-around-the-edges. The story is a fairly familiar one and can be a touch predictable in places, though that was inevitable really. For all that though, the story still has an immense amount of charm and sweetness without being overly so and it is very touching as well. You can hardly call it dull either. The music has energy and enhances the action and emotions, and it also is beautifully orchestrated, lush and characterful but not syrupy. Kids and adults alike will be taken with the splashes of humour that Goliath II has and will easily be moved and be able to relate to Goliath II and his situation. The narration is well-humoured and sympathetic with little of it explaining too much without need to. Sterling Holloway's voice is immediately recognisable and he delivers the narration perfectly, quirky and sensitive at the same time. Goliath II is adorable and brings poignancy to the story with ease. His situation and conflicts are those that are easy to identify with and in the short done in a way that doesn't talk down to you. Overall, a very charmingly and well done short, the animation has its limits but much of everything else is fine. 8/10 Bethany Cox</p>
