<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let's be honest. This movie is ridiculous. Everything about it is preposterous. But nonetheless it's a lot of fun.The plot is fairly simply. A group of bumbling petty thieves decide to try for a bigger score - kidnapping! So they scope out Jimmy Lovejoy, the overly-mature son of a father and wife singing duo. Did I mention that his parents sing country music? What??? In spite of being kidnapped Jimmy grows close to his kidnappers. And they like him too. He eventually ends up helping them, while at the same time trying to steer them down a different career path.Throw in Pat Morita as the blind chauffeur, Avery Schreiber as a crazy psychiatrist and Ruth Gordon's line about "wet panties" and you have a fairly memorable forgotten film.Silly as it may be, I found it much more entertaining than it probably should have been. We can chalk that up to a pretty stellar cast. Why none of Gary Coleman's movies are on DVD I'll never know. If this ever comes out, I'll line up to buy it. Until then, I'll stick with the DVD-r I copied from my old pre-recorded VHS tape.Watch it! You won't be disappointed!</p>
