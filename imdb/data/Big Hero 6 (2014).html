<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!</p>
