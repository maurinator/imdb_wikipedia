<h1>A Little Sex (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of one man's hilarious - and doomed - attempts to wield life's ultimate double-edged sword: infidelity.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent film that is full of comedy, romance and a good comparison between being married and single. Michael Donovan, (Tim Matheson) and Katherine, (Kate Capshaw) are a young couple who enjoy the pleasure of living with each other unmarried. Michael has a big problem which is loving the girls too much and far too many one-night stands and therefore is afraid of tying the knot of marriage.Michael and Katherine have lots of fun teasing each other and shocking the older generation with sexy talk while picking out fruit from an open market.One day, out of the blue, Michael asks Katherine if she would like to marry him, which rather took Katherine off guard and she did say, "YES".This is when the story takes on another direction for this married couple and of course, Michael has to fight off all his sexual desires to make love to other women.Tim Matheson and Katherine had great chemistry working together and this made for a great entertaining film to view and enjoy.</p>
