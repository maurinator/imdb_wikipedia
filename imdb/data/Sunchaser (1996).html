<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The plot of this movie is an abomination. An agonising creature, writhing in pain, begging even for deliverance. It's not a pretty sight.Were they trying to document every possible movie clich√©? If so, it's a commendable effort: they've not missed many. The characters act in ludicrously illogical ways, one of them is thrown in solely to awkwardly preach nonsensical views directly to the viewer... a rattlesnake even randomly shows up to serve as a plot device. As a form of entertainment, "The Sunchaser" fails on every level.But it's worse than just a bad piece of entertainment: it's the kind that (insistantly) advocates belief in quack remedies, faith healing and various other forms of absurd mysticisms (including astrology!) and that kind of message is borderline criminal.Watch something else. Anything else.P.S.: Electricity does not neutralise snake venom of any kind. It can only make matters worse.</p>
