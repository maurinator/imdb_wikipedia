<h1>Distant Thunder (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A troubled Vietnam war vet deserts his wife and child shortly after he returns from the war. He returns after 10 years, where he's been living like an animal in the forest. He finds himself unprepared for the changes that he will have to cope with, and when the vet tries to contact his son, he realizes that he has caused more damage than he had imagined.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was the 1980s and America (and countries like Australia who sent troops to Vietnam) were obsessed with the lives of Vietnam Veterans.John Lithgow plays Jack, a vet who eeks out an existence in a bush camp. When his friend decides to kiss a train he thinks it is time for him to try life in the real world again.Char yes is a lovely woman who helps him and encourages him to get in contact with his lost son, but unfortunately her boyfriend does like Jack and he heads back into the bush.I don't really blame him when his son turns out to be Ralph Macchio (of Karate Kid fame). Still this movie has a heart, but the characters lack depth, which is not made up for by cheesy dialog.I watched this movie because I read good reviews about it in this website.I would say watch this with hamburger hill to get a good, but superficial look at the lives of Vietnam Vets, both in country and back home (also some of the language and phrases used in Distant thunder, such as "it don't mean nothing" make more sense after seeing Hamburger Hill).But please don't expect too much of a humble little drama like this and you will enjoy it.</p>
