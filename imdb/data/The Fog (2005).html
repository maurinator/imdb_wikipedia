<h1>The Fog (2005)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The inhabitants of Antonio Island, off the coast of Oregon, are about to unveil a statue honoring the four men (Castle, Wayne, Williams and Malone) who founded their town in 1871. Nick Castle is one of the descendants of the men, and owns a fishing charter company, using his vessel, the Seagrass, for tourism. When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams returns to the island after spending six months in New York, a bizarre series of events begin to occur, including several gruesome deaths and the presence of a mysterious fog. When Elizabeth slips in Nick's boathouse and falls into the sea, she finds an old journal from 1871, written by Patrick Malone, one of the town's founders. It tells how a man named Blake bought half the island for use as a leper colony. While bringing his people to Antonio Island in their clipper ship, the Elizabeth Dane, Blake is betrayed by Castle, Wayne, Williams and Malone. The four men locked Blake and his people in the vessel, stole their money and possessions, and then set fire to the ship, killing everyone aboard. In the present day, the ghosts of Blake and his crew have risen from their watery grave to seeking revenge on the descendants of the four men.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Today's forecast is foggy with a 90% percent chance of EVIL!! The Fog is one of those films that just make you feel like trying to figure out what the guy behind you had for dinner. This remake of another 1980's version just doesn't make the cut at all in my opinion. In fact it falls several meters short. The basic premise here is that there's a small fishing town who's founding fathers committed a terrible crime and now vengeance is being sought in the form of a killer fog.Think about that for a second A KILLER FOG!!!!! Does that sound scary at all!?!?!!? It's not as if you could possibly go into a movie about killer fog expecting to come out crying (unless you cry when your extremely bored). From a horror movie point of view this movie is more akin to an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. It's just not scary at all you can spot every single little BOO from a mile away. On top of that it doesn't even make sense!!! I don't want to spoil anything here (because I know you're all just burning inside to drop whatever your doing and go see this film) but things just happen in the movie that don't even make sense at all!!! And you think they'll tie in later but they don't!!! Maybe they're setting up for "The Fog 2: Thicker Fog"? The movies only saving graces are some hot actresses, and Superman. Actually no, not even Superman could save this god forsaken kitty litter of a film.To put a cap on things I would rather be decapitated with safety scissors than see this movie again. Please if you go to see this movie make sure to wear adequate protection,and you might want to book your therapy appointment before you go. They're a little bit backed up these days.</p>
