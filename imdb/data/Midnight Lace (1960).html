<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In London, the American futile housewife Katherine "Kit" Preston has been married for three months with the American executive Anthony "Tony" Preston. In a foggy day, while walking in a park, Kit is threatened by a voice that tells that she will be murdered by the end of the month. On the next day, Kit receives a phone call from the stalker and she goes with Tony to the Scotland Yard, but Inspector Byrnes believes that Kit is making-up the story to get more attention from Tony. Kit welcomes her Aunt Bea but only she receives the phone calls. Would Kit be losing her mind?</p>
<p>American heiress Kit Preston has lived in London for the past three months, ever since she got married to British financier Tony Preston, owner of his own business. One foggy day, a terrified Kit hears a high pitched, sing-song like man's voice saying to her among other things that he will kill her by the end of the month. This threat is followed by many more similar ones told to her over the telephone, with no one ever hearing the voice but her. Tony wants to believe her and tries on several occasions to assist her in finding out who is making the threats. Scotland Yard also gets involved, but Inspector Byrnes, after hearing more and more about the calls from Kit, believes her stories stem from a neglected housewife trying to get some attention. Both she and Tony would admit to Tony neglecting her as he is kept preoccupied with work difficulties. Even Kit's visiting Aunt Bea and the Preston's neighbor Peggy want to believe her, but their actions sometimes say otherwise. Could the caller be the seemingly sympathetic Brian Younger, the foreman of the construction site next to the Preston's flat, he who seems to know more about Kit than Kit has told him? Or could it be Malcolm Stanley, the Preston's housekeeper's parasite of a son? Kit has to find someone who can help her before the caller carries out his threat, which is increasingly making Kit hysterical as is her continued sighting of a man she believes is the caller.</p>
<p>Kit and Anthony Preston never had a real honeymoon, and the midnight lace pajamas are for when they can finally get out of London. Anthony's business is very pressing these days. Then Kit is frightened one day in a London fog by a voice behind a statue. Next the telephone calls start. Then there is a new man on the block, the architect of a building going up next to the Prestons' vintage apartment. That vintage building has the kind of curving stairwell and cage-type elevator that Hitchcock and other suspense masters have loved. Could Kit merely have an overactive imagination?</p>
<p>In London, a newly-wed American woman's sanity comes into question, when she claims to be the victim of a stalker.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I started seeing this movie without great expectations but I must admit that it was a very positive surprise. David Miller has made a movie which in my opinion is to be compared with the best Hitchcock ever made. An excellent cast: John Gavin and Myrna Loy give good performances and Rex Harrison is - as always - Rex Harrison.But it's Doris Days film. She was perfect in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" but here she's better. An outstanding performance. No other actress can look so terror-stricken, without overacting. The sequence where she is stuck in an elevator, gives a good impression of what she can.If you haven't seen this movie - rush to see it.</p>
