<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Naive young teacher Marianne is on her way to a new position when she takes pity on a young man she finds manacled to the wall in an old castle.But she doesn't realise that Baron Meinster has been chained up by his mother because he's a vampire.Before long Meinster is on the prowl targeting the nearby girl's school-but vampire hunter Dr Van Helsing is on his trail...Very well-directed and fabulously acted follow-up to Terence Fisher's "Dracula" with fantastic acting and plenty of eerie atmosphere.The exterior shots of the windmill in the film's climax are both iconic and awe-inspiring and Peter Cushing is truly memorable as a quick-witted Van Helsing.The script is truly superb with such lovely nuances as never before seen way of destroying the vampire.There is also a spooky village that appears in every movie of this type,utterly interchangeable with the Klausenburg of "Horror of Dracula" or the Vandorf of "The Gorgon".9 out of 10.</p>
