<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Terminal Man" is a classic Michael Crichton story.  The science fiction is based in reality.  For the time, the novel represented the cutting edge of our understanding of the brain and its pain and pleasure pathways.  It seems hard to believe, but in 1974 little was known about the mechanism of addiction and substances like endorphins. The concept of harnessing them was a dream.  Today, they are entering lay speech and find their way into everything from diets and meditation to sports.As a physician with a talent for using current research to feed his imagination, Crichton constructs unique novels.  1971's "Andromeda Strain" was the first big success, and studied our concept of life and biologic evolution.  "The Terminal Man" asked the question of what would happen when main gains control of himself.  How will he use that power?  Will it change him?  Will it work?In character with many of his novels, the scientific detail is impossible to big to the screen.  A film can only run so long.  Many Crichton fans will always prefer his books to the movie.  However, this under appreciated film brings the story to life.  It is relatively free of the soliloquies of background data that are seen in many science fiction films.  The viewer learns threw the eyes of the patient.  The main story line still comes across well, and the viewer experiences the emotions and dilemmas of the patient.The irony here is that a science has now proven the film's premise correct. Animal studies confirm the side effects vividly depicted in the film.  As we enter the new millennium, severe pain and cancer patients use the techniques envisioned by Michael Crichton.  "The Terminal Man" is an example if fiction becoming fact, and film previewing our future.If one likes science and science fiction, it is a good film to pick.  The drama of the patients predicament will also entertain drama fans.  This was made in 1971, so if you are a great CGI and action fan you may be disappointed. So use your imagination.</p>
