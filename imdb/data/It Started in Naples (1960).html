<h1>It Started in Naples (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mike Hamilton, a Philadelphia lawyer, comes to Naples to settle the estate of his long estranged "black sheep" brother. Once there, he discovers that the deceased has left an eight-year old little boy named Nando, who is being raised by Michael's sister-in-law Lucia Curcio. Mike immediately disapproves of Nando's Italian-style (in other words "lax") education. To make matters worse, Lucia happens to be ... a sexy nightclub dancer. This is too much for a puritan like Mike and the only solution in his eyes is to have the boy brought up in the States...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a wonderful movie starring two of filmdoms' greatest stars-Clark Gable and the beautiful Sophia Loren. Set in Naples and the island of Capri this is one attractive movie.Great story line and excellent music and a wonderful performance by the master himself Vittorio De Sica. Add to the cast a young Italian actor by the name of Marietto playing a wise-cracking street kid from Naples and you have the perfect afternoon treat. Though this was Gables' second last movie before the ill fated Misfits (a movie I would rather forget)he looks in excellent shape and still has that twinkle in his eye that made him a star for over 25 years. This movie is just magic. Enough said.</p>
