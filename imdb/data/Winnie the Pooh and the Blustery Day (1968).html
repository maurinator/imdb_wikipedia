<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pooh is back and this time he's gonna blow you away! Almost literally! When Pooh's friend Gopher warns him that it's Winds-Day, Pooh goes off to wish Piglet a Happy Windsday, but Piglet is lifted into the air by the strong winds, Pooh grabs Piglet's sweater string and looks to be flying Piglet like a kite. They arrive at Owl's house, the wind blows it down and Owl inquires as to if Pooh did it. Eeyore agrees to find a new house for Owl, but one night, Pooh get's a visit from an unusual new friend- Tigger, a rambunctious tiger who likes honey but hates it just the same, and warns Pooh of Hefalumps and Woozels that steal honey! But Hefalumps and Woozels are only half of Pooh's worries now, for a huge rain storm has set on the Hundred Acre Wood. Everybody is swimming in their homes. Pooh inadvertently saves Piglet from a waterfall so they have a hero party. Eeyore then barges in and announces he has found a new home for Owl, unfortunately the house he found was Piglet's. But Piglet does a heroic thing and turns over his domicile to Owl, so they have a Two Hero Party and the storm dies down. At least until next Winds-Day.</p>
<p>Winnie the Pooh and his friends experience high winds, heavy rains, and a flood in Hundred Acre Wood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Winnie the Pooh has always been a favorite of mine. The original stories are in the realm of the Mary Poppins stories, i.e., difficult to translate to film.  In this instance, Disney has managed to transfer the charm of the Pooh stories intact to the screen.  Winnie is simply adorable as an animated character, and Sterling Holloway gives him the perfect voice.  All the other characters are voiced with perfection, too, especially Tigger, who makes his debut in this short film.  Tigger almost steals the show from Pooh; when he's onscreen, you don't notice anything else.  Sebastian Cabot adds just the right touch as the narrator.The entire film has the feel of the pink elephant sequence in Dumbo; inspired, creative and unforgettable. During the storm, pages from the book blow away as the wind rises, rain washes text down the page and away into a stream, etc. Everyone should love this adaptation; Disney soon cranked Pooh out as a series, and it got tedious and sloppy.  But this early effort is a real masterpiece.</p>
