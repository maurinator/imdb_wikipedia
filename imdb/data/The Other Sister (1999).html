<h1>The Other Sister (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Carla Tate, now a young woman, is 'graduated' out of the training school where she has resided for many years because she is mentally challenged, her hope is that she will be accepted for all that she can now do for herself. But Carla's family is wealthy which permits her mother, already blinded to her daughter's rather high-functioning abilities, to try and provide for Carla beyond her needs or desires, bringing forth the inevitable confrontations... for what Carla may lack in mental ability she certainly makes up for in her insistence on being independent, even to living in her own apartment. But if this isn't enough, into the mix comes a young man, equally challenged mentally, who moves Carla beyond anyone's control...</p>
<p>A mentally challenged girl proves herself to be every bit as capable as her "perfect" sister when she moves into an apartment and begins going to college.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i don't know who's voting for these movies, but someone needs to wake up! this one was great!  it was funny (and i don't mean that in a mocking way) where i didn't expect it to be.  all angles of the story were handled well. a great love story, which i didn't expect, and the family issues are very well worked out.  i liked how one of the sisters being a lesbian worked into the story, but i didn't like the result of the dispute between the mother and that sister.  i thought it happened kind of sudden.  but a very minor detail!  i loved how the two "disAbled" people were so expressive of what they thought!  juliette did a wonderful job of acting when her character got upset.  very believable.  i'll be looking foreward to seeing you at the academy awards.</p>
