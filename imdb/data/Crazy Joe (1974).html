<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The rise and fall of a Mafia gangster, based on the life of murdered New York gangster "Crazy" Joey Gallo.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As far as being a true story goes, it is, but it is very sketchy, very broad strokes. If you know the history of the guy this is just a 1 minute flat quickie pencil sketch. I'm a fan of the director, but he usually puts more into the story and meaning than this. It's a very simple '70s mafia flick that satisfies that craving if you just want 100 minutes of the sights and genre and not much more. It is not an underrated classic. It's a solid, slightly above average example of the genre. It is not in the same league with the top 20 Italian crime flicks of the era (like the "Violenta" trilogy), but is as good as Hollywood's from this period. That's why I give it a six. I love Italian films from the '70s and '60s and consider them to be much better than Hollywood's output. To say one is on a par, is to say it's a bit of a disappointment that way, though I wasn't disappointed to have watched it. Once.I'm a fanatic about pairing food and movies, and for this one I highly recommend Spaghettini and Red Clam Sauce.</p>
