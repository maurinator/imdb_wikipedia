<h1>The Last Lions (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fifty years ago there were close to half-a-million lions in Africa. Today there are around 20,000. To make matters worse, lions, unlike elephants, which are far more numerous, have virtually no protection under government mandate or through international accords. This is the jumping-off point for a disturbing, well-researched and beautifully made cri de coeur from husband and wife team Dereck and Beverly Joubert, award-winning filmmakers from Botswana who have been Explorers-in-Residence at National Geographic for more than four years. Pointing to poaching as a primary threat while noting the lion's pride of place on the list for eco-tourists-an industry that brings in 200 billion dollars per year worldwide-the Jouberts build a solid case for both the moral duty we have to protect lions (as well as other threatened "big cats," tigers among them) and the economic sense such protection would make. And when one takes into account the fact that big cats are at the very top of the food chain-and that their elimination would wreak havoc on all species below them, causing a complete ecosystem collapse-the need takes on a supreme urgency.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was one of the fortunate few who were introduced today to this cinematic dreamscape of Botswana and the incredible life of one brave lioness. The premiere in Houston, TX was presented by National Geographic and the audience was also treated to a Q&A session with the actual film makers -- Dereck and Beverly Joubert. Quite an honor and special event offered to the contributors of the Big Cats initiative where the donations help dedicated researchers and animal conservationists find solutions to the grave threats facing lions, tigers, leopards, and other big cats. This documentary provided scenes of survival that even this Big Cat Diary watcher has never witnessed. Amazing truths of the brutal life in the wild that these creatures face every day in Africa. Incredible scenes of the adaptation of the kings and queens of the jungle and their unwavering dedication to the protection of their young.The musical score and cinematography, together with the slightly subdued drama beautifully presented by Jeremy Irons made this a truly riveting experience that I will never forget and, for which I am proud to be a continued supporter.This is a must see for animal lovers.</p>
