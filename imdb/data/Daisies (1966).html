<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Daisies is a wonderful embodiment of the Prague Spring.   Hedonism and consumerism get criticised while the  inflammatory criticism is coded more subtly.  At a time when Stalinism was being re-examined and the  reputations of many Czechs were being "rehabilitated", Daisies was a well-masked critique of these reforms. The crazy 1960s cinematography, the strange accents of the two main characters, and the sheer hedonism (the  economy was quite poor at the time) give a surreal edge to what is not a surreal film.  The film also hints of a  Czechoslovakia identifying with Western Europe and  impatient with the regime -- despite its reforms.  The cinematography is fun and the story is a definite upending of the usual role of women in Czech films.  If you're looking for deep symbolism, you'll be disappointed.  But as a fun romp, a sign of the times, and a historical piece, Daisies is superb.</p>
