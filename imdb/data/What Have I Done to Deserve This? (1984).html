<h1>What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Madrid, the housewife Gloria lives in a tiny apartment with her husband, the taxi driver and forger Antonio; her lunatic mother-in-law, who is addicted in bottled water and cupcakes; and two teenage sons, one of them a drug dealer and the other gay. Gloria works as cleaning lady to raise some money for her dysfunctional family and is addicted in pills; her best friend is her neighbor, the call-girl Cristal. Antonio has a secret passion on a decadent German singer for whom he had worked as driver in Germany. A writer tries to convince Antonio to forge letters from Hitler and travels to Germany to meet the singer to invite her to participate in the scheme. Meanwhile Gloria delivers her gay son to a pervert dentist. Her mother-in-law finds a lizard while walking with her grandson on the street and they call it Dinero (Money) and bring it home. When Gloria has an argument with Antonio, she hits him on the head with a piece of wood, killing him. Now the police detectives investigate the murder case.</p>
<p>A dysfunctional family in Madrid: Gloria is a cleaning lady, hooked on No-Doze, living in a crowded flat with Antonio, her surly husband, a cabby who adores an aging German singer he used to chauffeur; he's also a forger. One teen son sells heroin, the other sleeps with men. Her mother-in-law keeps bottled water and cupcakes under lock and key, selling them to the family. Two alcoholic writers cook up a plot to sell a manuscript as Hitler's memoirs, if Antonio will transcribe it in Hitler's hand. He agrees, so they ask the German singer to play the role of the original owner since her past affinity for Nazi memorabilia makes her a likely candidate. Meanwhile, Gloria has given away one son to a sex-crazed dentist, and grandma picks up a pet lizard. Can this chaos be tamed?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found myself wrapped up in this off-beat movie, off-beat that is, for anyone but  Almodóvar in the mid 1980s. For him, this one was sort of tame. It's populated by an  Almodovaran crowd of demimonde, and struggling proletarians and intellectuals. Some  take drugs to get by, some sell drugs but won't take them. Sex is a commodity, and  honor a dubious value. The struggle to survive in a harsh urban environment ought not  be as comic as this often is, so it's not surprising when Almodóvar brings a little  emotional sustenance to leaven the pessimism. But nobody in this film should be taken  at face value, least of all the director, and nothing should be taken too seriously. It's fun,  and in the end, that's enough.</p>
