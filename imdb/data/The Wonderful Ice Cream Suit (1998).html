<h1>The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gomez is a middle-aged man who dreams of buying a gorgeous white suit in a nearby store, but doesn't have enough cash. He finds 4 more people of same size, who each give $20 and get to wear the suit for an hour each in return. But the suit is not just a suit - it makes wishes of the one wearing it come true.</p>
<p>In East L.A., con-man Gomez convinces four strangers to pool their money to buy a luminescent vanilla ice-cream-colored suit; he intends to split for El Paso, well-dressed. The first night, each gets the suit for an hour, and each is transformed: Dominguez with his guitar and voice charms women who dance in a parade through the plaza; Martinez's shine gets his lovely neighbor's attention; street poet Villanazul captures a crowd with his political and economic vision for the east side. The suit makes Gomez a better man, so he may not bolt; but then, what do they do with the last partner, the filthy Â¡Vamanos!, whose juicy-taco-eating, wine-drinking habits could ruin the suit?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Watching this movie which promised wonderful things -- not just the suit, but the titles, the art direction, a magical Sid Caesar, a heart-thumping Esai Morales -- watching all this go along on the one level that Bradbury allows, all human dimensions squeezed into his One Poetic Idea.  Of course the dirty guy is going to take a bath.  Of course Gomez won't get on the bus.  etc.  Joe Mantegna, who i believe has incredible range as an actor, is given one dimension to convey.  Caricature.  Then, beautiful emotional face of the young man Gonzalez -- also beautiful editing.  Next time i watch with no sound.</p>
