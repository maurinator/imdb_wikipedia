<p>Ellen's first date with the 'man of her dreams' is almost perfect. 'Prince Charming' is young, stylish, witty ... but a woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"She Said Lenny" was beautifully written by one of it's own actresses, Kate Hewlett. It is a 6 minute short, and even in its small amount of time it gives a real meaning to love. I can't really say much more on it because of how short it is. Anything said would basically give any spoilers away. Personally, I watched and listened to this before several times and it's still sweet even re watched. I like it because of its message of love and expectations. It's simple concept and kind story and dialogue. If you have a spare time for a sweet story of love, you probably won't be disappointed. Besides it's only a few minutes long. Why not try to watch it?</p>
