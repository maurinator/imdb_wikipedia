<h1>The Hiding Place (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Corrie and Betsie ten Boom are middle-aged sisters working in their father's watchmaker shop in pre-WWII Holland. Their uneventful lives are disrupted with the coming of the Nazis. Suspected of hiding Jews & caught breaking rationing rules, they are sent to a concentration camp, where their Christian faith keeps them from despair and bitterness. Betsie eventually dies, but Corrie survives, and after the war, must learn to love and forgive her former captors.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My grandmother took me to see this movie when it was released. I was a child and had not studied the holocaust yet but, even though I only saw this movie one time, I have never forgotten it. It takes a very special movie/story to have such an impact-especially on a child. Over the years, I've thought of this story often but I haven't ever seen it anywhere (TV, video store, etc...). It's a shame this movie hasn't been kept "alive" through re-makes and/or re-runs--It certainly deserves to be given the same respect and attention as "The Diary of Anne Frank" and "Schindler's List"! I'd love to see it again--even though I'd need a much bigger box of tissues this time!</p>
