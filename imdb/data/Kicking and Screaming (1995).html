<h1>Kicking and Screaming (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After college graduation, Grover's girlfriend Jane tells him she's moving to Prague to study writing. Grover declines to accompany her, deciding instead to move in with several friends, all of whom can't quite work up the inertia to escape their university's pull. Nobody wants to make any big decisions that would radically alter his life, yet none of them wants to end up like Chet, the professional student who tends bar and is in his tenth year of university studies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you're looking for an interesting, involving movie that uses dialogue thoughtfully (and efficiently), step aside, or you're liable to be swept up when this dust storm of 20's angst and supposedly witty banter comes barrelin' through town. It's a gloomy episode of "Friends" stretched over an hour and a half, where "wit" is created through pop culture references, cheap cynicism, and nifty little one-liners.I'm still not sure what the point of the whole thing was; I've a feeling the only people who get anything from this movie are the ones who watch films for the experience of "relating to the characters."  Maybe the point was simply to give me a slice of post-college life.  Yuck.Man, is it bad.  Just stay away.</p>
