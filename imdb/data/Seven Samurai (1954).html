<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously "get it". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite "Yes!". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god</p>
