<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film reaches far beyond its time.  In every way, shape and form; from the troubles to the triumphs of the protaganist, to the intensity and sincerity of its ethos, this cinematic work is an under exposed classic. It is my hope that this film be rediscovered and in doing so help those lost in a sea of moral relativity to detect delineation.  The story cleary exposes the moral and emotional importance of honesty and its consequences. Additionally, the issue of war-time trauma is touched upon and its long-term impact on personal and professional relationships.The performances by all are outstanding and will resonate with the viewer dramatically.  As a gen x'r, I found this film to be a breath of fresh air. I am not alone.  I pray that this story will be recirculated - for its impact is profound.</p>
