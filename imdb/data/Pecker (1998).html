<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Baltimore sandwich shop employee becomes an overnight sensation when a photographer's photos he's taken of his weird family become the latest rage in the art world.</p>
<p>A young adult named Pecker, who works at a sandwich shop/deli by day, takes pictures of his dysfunctional family, the crazy residents of Baltimore, places and even things around the city. One day at his own art show at the shop, New York art dealer Rorey Wheeler buys one of Pecker's "modern pictures" and invites girlfriend Shelley, a laundromat worker, common thief/best friend Matt, parents Jimmy and Joyce a struggling bartender/bar owner and bargain clothing store saleswoman, daughter Tina a hostess/bartender at a gay strip joint, their sugar-crazed young daughter Chrissy, and the family's religious grandmother called "Memama", a "pit beef" sandwich chef, to an art gallery in New York City. It is then that Pecker becomes an overnight art sensation nationwide. Unfortunately, serious problems arise back home. Many of the residents become appalled and embarrassed by his pictures, costing him a whole lot more than his friends. It's up to Pecker to make things right with his Shelley and make the people see the good from bad in photography.</p>
<p>A talented young photographer, who enjoys snapping photos of his satirical, perverted Baltimore neighborhood and his wacky family, gets dragged into a world of pretentious artists from New York City and finds newfound fame.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pecker lives in Baltimore and works as a chef in a fast-food restaurant.  He constantly takes pictures of those around him.  When he puts on a small show in his workplace a New York agent buys the lot and offers him a show at her NY gallery.  The show turns him famous for his honest photos of his `culturally challenged' family and friends.  But fame has a price and soon he must turn the tables on the art crowd who look down on his family.I approached this with a certain amount of good feeling.  From the very start we have wonderfully camp music and small town trashy characters  we're in Waters-ville. The actually story is quite simple and doesn't quite hang together as a narrative.  However it's all done with a nice charm that makes it fly by, only occasionally does the film drag and the plot weaknesses are revealed.Waters used to have a niche market in camp and bad taste, however with so many people doing bad taste comedies nowadays he seems to have toned it all down a bit.  However he still can do this in his sleep, although the story could have been stronger and he needed to direct with more focus and direction.Furlong is really good in the lead  you have to admire his role choices (Little Odessa, American History X, this and others) as he could have just tried to be a heart throb after T2.  Similarly Ricci is pretty good in a role that isn't quite trashy but isn't mainstream either.  The support cast are also good as they have more of the characters that we expect from Walters as well as some famous faces (Lilli Taylor, Martha Plimpton, Patty Hearst)  Brendan Sexton III as Matt is really good but the award for funniest role goes to Hulsey for angry sugar junkie Little Chrissy.Overall I found this enjoyable despite the story not really moving anywhere fast.  Fans may find this to be Waters-lite but even then he can put out a good film.</p>
