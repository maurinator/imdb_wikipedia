<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The student Shirô Shimizu (Shigeru Amachi) is in love with his girlfriend Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya) and they want to get married. While returning home with his evil friend Tamura (Yôichi Numata) driving their car, they hit and run the Yakuza Kyôichi (Hiroshi Izumida). Kyôichi's mother and wife seek them out to revenge the death of Kyôichi. Meanwhile Shirô decides to turn himself in to the police and he takes a taxi with Yukiko but there is a car crash and Yukiko dies, in the beginning of the bizarre journey to hell of Shirô."Jigoku" is a weird and insane Japanese horror cult movie from the 60's. The story begins with a great jinx and crisis of conscience of Shirô, but out of the blue the screenplay becomes bizarre and messy. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Inferno" ("Hell")</p>
