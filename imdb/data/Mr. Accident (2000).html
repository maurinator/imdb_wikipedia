<p>Why does everyone have to take everything so, so, so, serious.  ;)  This was just for fun.  I watched this move and my stomach hurt I was laughing so hard.  I guess some people just don't know how to have fun.  Hopefully, I'll never be in that crowd of people...ROCK ON YAHOO!!!And make more movies...And release some DVD's...</p>
