<h1>Chasers (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A hapless Navy grunt is assigned SP duty. The catch: he must escort a beautiful female prisoner on her way to prison for going UA. She in turn will try anything to escape.</p>
<p>Eddie Devane, a born charmer, has used his term in the USNavy, where he's every man's friend and every girl's darling, to set up a lucrative scam at Uncle Sam's expense, counting on the proceeds to pay for the Porsche of his dreams. On 4 July, his discharge day, he is however assigned for SP duty, escorting prisoner Toni Johnson, with grumpy hard-ass sergeant Rock Reilly. That turns out a grueling job as she is clever and determined to escape, and Eddie soon succumbs to her female charms as in time even Rock may. And more surprises follow...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Chasers" vacillates wildly between military drama, and frat slobs on vacation silliness. There is a steady slide downhill in believability. The acting is only average, and the script well below that. Nevertheless, the movie is watchable, mainly because of the interesting supporting cast. The best scenes are with Gary Busey, Crispin Glover, and Dennis Hopper. The real problem is that the film doesn't have a flow, with sex scenes giving way to cartoon-like silliness, kung fu fighting, and ridiculous romance. I suppose if you can throw logic out the window, there might be enough here to interest some, but that's a long shot at best. - MERK</p>
