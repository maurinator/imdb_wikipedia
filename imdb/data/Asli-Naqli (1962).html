Then things brighten up when a homeless young man, Anand, enters her life, both fall in love with each other and want to get married.

Watch as events unfold and the effect this news has on the townspeople and Renu's mom.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This classic movie of the early 60's is a fair manifestation of excellent skills of Hrishida's direction.The song "Tera Mera Piyar Amar" is indeed mesmerizing and remarkable in ingenuity. The other Lata-Rafi duet "Tujhe jeevan ki dor se" is also a memorable one. Above all, the direction is superb and carries a stark imprint of the master director who was coming on his feet to craft future hits like, Bawarchi, Anand, Mili, Abhiman and Namak Haram.Even though the movie is black and white still it was a box office hit. Sadhana's pure beauty and graceful acting surpasses Dev Anand's casual acting style. A good entertaining movie of the old guard.</p>
