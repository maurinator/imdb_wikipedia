<h1>Il vedovo (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alberto Nardi (Alberto Sordi) is a Roman businessman who fancies himself a man of great capabilities, but whose factory (producing lifts and elevators) teeters perennially on the brink of catastrophe. Alberto is married to a rich and successful businesswoman from Milan, Elvira Almiraghi (Franca Valeri) who has a no-nonsense attitude and barely tolerates the attempts of her husband to keep his factory afloat with her money.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Please be aware that this is one of the funniest movies ever produced. Alberto Sordi is here at his best comedy, and he is surrounded by a cast of great characters, portrayed by a group of wonderful, lesser-known Italian actors (Franca Valeri, the wife, a clear cut above everybody else). You really should not pass on this movie. The story it's even a great depiction of a specific Italian period (the late 50's, early 60's of the industrial growth after WW2). Some of the greatest talents of Italian cinema, namely director Dino Risi and writer Rodolfo Sonego, are featured in the credits: and they are probably in what could be considered their prime. So you should do yourself a favor, and watch this movie.</p>
