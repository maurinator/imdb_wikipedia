<h1>Choose Me (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Several lost-soul night-owls, including a nightclub owner, a talkback radio relationships counseller, and an itinerant stranger have encounters that expose their contradictions and anxieties about love and acceptance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saw this when it came out. Still vivid in my mind I add another two cents to say its worth viewing again. Good writers, production and cast, Nice year for this fast movie, set the path, so to speak.</p>
