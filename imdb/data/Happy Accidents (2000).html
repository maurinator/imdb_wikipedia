<h1>Happy Accidents (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ruby Weaver has man trouble: she tries to fix them, so she's stuck herself with a string of losers. Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ruby Weaver, a person who has made bad choices in the boyfriend department, thinks she's finally found a decent life partner in Sam.  That is, until he claims he's a time traveler from the future.  She plays along at first, but Sam's stories become increasingly weird, and Ruby questions his mental health.This was such a cute little movie, I decided to by the DVD.  The two lead characters were actually entertaining, unlike the cardboard cutouts in most romantic comedies i've seen in the last few years.  Brad Anderson is a talented guy, and i'd like to see what else he's directed now.</p>
