Later that day, after complaining to her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott about her husband's pathetic performance in bed, she meets a strange man at a museum and returns to his apartment where they continue an adulterous encounter that began in the taxicab. Before she leaves his apartment, she finds papers which certify that the man has a venereal disease.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Dressed To Kill", is one of the best thrillers ever made.  Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults.  Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story.  He directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and Pino Donnagio's brilliant score.  Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story.  Cropped, on video, "Dressed To Kill", is barely the same movie.  Solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.</p>
