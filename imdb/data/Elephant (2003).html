<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For many months I have been just reading others' reviews, not really caring about any movie enough to write a review. This movie, though, was the one that finally made me do it and here is my first review. It was so bad...This has to be the most shallow, unrealistic, boring, pretentious film I have seen in my life. Where do I start?Why is it shallow? First of all, how does anyone, besides Eric and Alex contribute anything to the plot. The constant flash-backs (Memento style) do nothing for the plot. Why does it matter that John's dad is a drunkard? Why does it matter that Eli loves photography? Why does it matter that Michelle is a nerd? These people are just there and they contribute nothing to the movie. We don't feel anything about them - neither pity, nor affection.Why is it unrealistic? What kind of a dumb ass (John) knows that there is about to be a massacre in his school and just warns 5 kids? Any normal person would run straight to a cop or a teacher and call 911. He just runs around feebly warning some people. Then when he finds his dad, the two of them sit calmly in front of the school and John asks "Where did you go" in the most "as-a-matter-of-fact" manner I have seen. Then when the shots start people hear them and are "Oh gosh what was that?" and do NOTHING about it. When they find out, they just run around without warning anyone (the girl in the bathroom). The two killers are seen before they start shooting (the janitor) and no one does anything. Michelle sees two guys with two guns each, but just says Hey, you guys, you can't..." What the heck? no screaming, no nothing? In addition, no one in high school picks on nerds so they can hear them or throw papers at them. This is not frickin middle school, give me a break.Why boring? Simply because there is a approximately a grand total of 100 lines of dialogue in a 100+ min movie. Tha rest consists of fake and weak intellectual efforts.Why pretentious? The lifeguard (the most insignificant character in the movie) walks for 4 minutes with Schopin in the background? How pretentious is that? The movie tries so hard to be intellectual, but falls flat.</p>
