<h1>North West Frontier (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In northwestern India soon after the turn of the 20th Century, Moslem rebels seek to kill a six-year-old Hindu prince to end his family line. Captain Scott of the British Army is ordered to get the prince out of the region safely. Adventure ensues as Scott sneaks the child away, through Moslem-held territory, by train. Also on board are the boy's American governess, an arms merchant, a cynical reporter, and two upper class Britons.</p>
<p>In colonial India's NW frontier province, usually rivaling Muslim tribes have united against the Hindus and slay leading rajah, whose son, prince Kishan (6), has been saved at the last minute. By the time his party arrives in the British governor's capital, it's under siege and may fall soon. Captain Scott leads an attempt to escape with the prince and a few Westerners, such as half-Javan Dutchman Van Leyden, a US newspaper's critical correspondent, by ramming loyal Gupta's decommissioned steam train Old Victoria trough the barricade by surprise. However danger lurks all the long way, and not just from outside.</p>
<p>In British India, a young prince must be taken to safey across rebel-held territory, and an old train is the only way to do it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie opens in a way Hollywood could never do, just more dramatic and colourful than Hollywood does. This movie gave more back than I expected. It is a breathtaking, breathholding, exciting little movie. You feel like you are really there in India, on the rickety old train. I love that they used old machinery instead of making it unrealistic the way Hollywood might.I was not expecting much from Lauren Bacall but she also gave back more than was required. Her scenes with the young Indian boy are touching. She obviously has a way with children in real life as well. The song Swing, Swing Together could make me weep, it's so wonderful. The movie is not well known but so well done. It's just a very well done one that everyone can enjoy. There are some questionable characters on the train, you are left wondering why this one is so twitchy, what is that one's secret?</p>
