<h1>Oz (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dorothy is a sixteen-year-old groupie riding with a rock band when, suddenly, the van is in a road accident, and she hits her head. She wakes up in a fantasy world as gritty and realistic as the one she came from and learns she killed a young thug in the process. A gay clothier called the Good Fairy gives her a pair of red shoes as a reward to help her see the last concert of the Wizard, an androgynous rock singer. She is pursed by the thug's brother who attempts to rape her on several occasions. She also meets a dumb surfer, a heartless mechanic, and a cowardly biker.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, THE WIZARD OF OZ as a rock and roll Australian road movie and made in the Xanadu of screen musical decades, the 70s. I kid you not. So gobsmackingly awful that it is genuinely entertaining and with the nasal whining so endearing to International Audiences...and with rock songs, a surfing dude, grubby mechanic and a chick called...Dorothy, and a very camp fairy godmother (who would put Gerrit Graham from Phantom Of The Paradise back in queerschool) help to make OZ the dazzling home movie Aussie legend it is. Haven't seen it? track it down somehow and settle back for one of the best cinema treats of truly pre Priscilla campery (again) from Australia. It all ends up in Melbourne at a rock concert at the incredible 3000 seat Palais Theatre which is reason enough to watch. How Melbourne qualifies as a destination equal to any Emerald City is dubious. Everyone knows Emerald City is also Sydney's Australian nickname. We just can't help ourselves living here, can we! A guilty pleasure is OZ and a true pleasure is the land of Oz.</p>
