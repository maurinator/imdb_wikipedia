<h1>Zeppelin (2014)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Narrated by Jeremy Anthony, Zeppelin is one of these DVDs that is presumably aimed as an easy present for your dad for Father's Day.Zeppelin traces the history of airships and some significant disasters which there were several.It traces the pioneering efforts of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who innovated the airship and founded the airship company that carried its name to the fate of the Hindenburg's sister ship the Graf Zeppelin. There was the race by the British and Americans to catch up with the Germans who also built their own airships and also had their share of disasters.The documentary has some decent archive film footage, photographs, and some rudimentary graphics. It zips through the the progress of airships from their use in World War I to their uses today mainly for aerial photography.I thought the documentary was no more than skin deep, some of the graphics were too basic and the way it was put together was rather vanilla as if lazily aimed at a DVD market where it would be picked up as a last minute present.</p>
