<p>A trilogy of three horror stories. "The Drop of Water" concerns a nurse who steals a ring off a dead spiritualist, only to have the corpse seek revenge.

There, he meets a family composed of two brothers, one sister, one sister-in-law and one nephew, and he falls in love at first sight with the beautiful Sdenka. He realizes that the dead man was a criminal, probably killed by the head of the family Gorca, and he is advised to leave that place, before Gorca arrives back at midnight. The family informs him that there is a chance that Gorca might have been transformed in a Wurdulak, a kind of vampire who drains blood from the living persons. A few seconds after midnight, Gorca comes back home, and the afraid family does not know whether he was transformed or not. The family discovers later what happened in a tragic way. (3)"La Goccia d' Acqua"- Helen Chester is called to prepare the body of a countess for her funeral. She steals the worthy ring from her finger. The countess comes back from beyond to retrieve her ring, terrifying the frightened woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This terrifying film plenty of vampires,weird deeds and murders is formed by three stories proceeded in some memorably horrific set-pieces: 1) The telephone by author Snyder : A prostitute(Michele Mercier) terrorized in her flat by phone calls from a broken-out inmate(Milo Quesada) receives visit her lover(Lidia Alfonsi). 2)The Wurdalak by Aleksey Tolstoi: In a night of nightmare during the early 1800s, a Russian noble(Mark Damon, usual in Spaghetti Western)and a family(exceptional Boris Karloff, a gorgeous Susy Andersen, and Massimo Roghi) stumble a vampires who must kill those love and go after their descendants; the undead vampires of hell terrorize the house in a orgy of stark horror. 3)The drop of water by Chekhov: In the early 1900s, a nurse(Jacqueline Pierreux, mother of actor Jean Pierre Leaud, 400 blows) steals a ring from a medium dead and she seeks avenge, then a ghastly specter arises, exacting cruel revenge for past robbery.Bava's second great hit(the first was Black Sunday or Mask of the demon) surprisingly realized with startling visual content and well scripted by Marcello Fondato and Albert Bevilacqua. This omnibus terror is plenty of thrills and chills in glimmer color in lurid paste with sensational results. This genuinely creepy tale is photographed by Ubaldo Terzano and Bava with magentas , shades of ochre,translucently pale turquoises and deep orange-red reflecting paleness the victims. Eerie and suspenseful musical score by Roberto Nicolisi, though in American version is composed by Lex Baxter, Corman's usual.The motion picture is stylishly and strikingly shot by Bava, filmed in parallel orbit to those Roger Corman( Edgar Allan Poe cycle) and produced by American International(James H. Nicholson, Samuel Z. Arkoff). He along with Riccardo Freda are fundamental masters of Italian horror, in fact collaborated deeply among them, as Bava terminated two films of Freda, ¨Il Vampiri and Caltiki¨and they created the Giallo sub-genre. Rating: Good, acceptable atmospheric direction from genre master Bava, this is one more compelling horror ventures in which his camera stalks in sinister style throughout a tale with extraordinaries visual skills.A must see for terror buffs.</p>
