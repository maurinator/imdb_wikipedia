<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anyone familiar with Bunuel will find a treat of similar proportions in Peppermint Frappe's fascinating study of a fetishistic mind.  This film is so carefully gripping that its mild-manneredness hides its thriller nature; instead,  the film favours a meticulous reconstruction of a man's past desire projected into a vertiginous present he now creates.  For all the layered desire and sexual tension,  however,  it is the subtle power of sublimation that works best.  Consider the long, breath-taking seduction scene of the radiologist,  the nurse & the rowing machine.  The art direction is excellent and the opening credit music is great.  Where the film loses its edge is in the direction,  which is not as skilled as that of the dedicatee.  This is more noticeable at the end,  where the camera movement gives way to freeform and has a very dated late 60's look.  A pivotal song in the film is likewise hard to take seriously.  Still,  the film is mesmerizing & scenic, & Jose of the 4 names- the radiologist,  gives a tremendously controlled performance.  It's his film and he carries it brilliantly.  Ana, the nurse,  is excellently portrayed as well.  Overall, fascinating but not sharp enough</p>
