<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Götter Der Pest, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is set in Munich, Germany. The main character Franz Walsch is a former prisoner played by Harry Baer. The setting is really dark and it reminds of film-noir but the plot is really realistic and I have to say anti-heroic. Franz doesn't have dreams, he seems that he doesn't want anything from his live. He is like a bored nihilist, a stoic human very different from the other characters of the film. The film centers on this character and his life. Franz had the chance to create a new life, he has every woman he wants, friends and his mother is still alone. But this affection seems to be drowned in hypocrisy of the modern society. Franz understands this and he chooses to continue a life of crime. Hanna Schygulla who plays Johanna is like the femme fatale of the story and she leads Franz to his death even if she loves him. Margarethe seems more loyal to Franz even if she is still lingered to society and her job. The male friends of Franz such as Gorilla are the only ones who can understand him. We have to point that Gorilla dies with him. Götter Der Pest is a punch to our society. Even if it is full of defects. The movie is very dark and at sometimes boring, the dialogs seem rather stodgy and arid. I think that Fassbinder shows his class here, because without a writing a great scenario he managed to do a nice movie which is worth of seeing even if it's not one of his bests. I recommend this movie to all of you who like artistic cinema and film-noir.</p>
