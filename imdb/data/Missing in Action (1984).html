<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Then I say go for it! But for those of you who want a movie with real substance and plot, run away from this film. I kind of found this movie entertaining in a brainless sense. Chuck Norris turns in a typical performance, the action is the same as we've all seen before, and it was pretty much 80's all over. A definite must-see for action addicts.</p>
