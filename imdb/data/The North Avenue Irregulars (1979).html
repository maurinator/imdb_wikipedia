<h1>The North Avenue Irregulars (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When crooks set up operations in a traditional town, a minister and a group of church ladies are willing to do anything, no matter how wacky, to get them out.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The "Family Film" label is too often attached to children's films, which have nothing to offer adults or more mature adolescence.  "North Avenue Irregulars" is still a Disney film, and it still caters to a younger audience, but, unlike other so-called family-films, this movie won't insult the intelligence of the adolescent nor college age film viewer.Again, even though it has a little more spunk than other Disney films, it is, afterall, a Disney film.  As such the topic of locals tackleing organized crime is kept G-rated (clean language, minimal violence, and so forth), but the comic moments and action balance quite well in one of the last of the truly classic Disney Family Films.Anyone who grew up in the suburban 70's and 80's will feel very much at home with the portrayal of what used to be suburban America; everything from the PTA mom down to the wood paneled station wagon.  It's worth a night's viewing.</p>
