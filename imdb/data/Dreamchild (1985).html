<h1>Dreamchild (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Exploring the somewhat darker and more mysterious side of the Lewis Carroll's classic book, the movie follows Alice Liddell (the book's inspiration) as an old woman who is haunted by the characters she was once so amused by. As she thinks back on it, she starts to see her relationship with the shy author/professor in a new way and realizes the vast change between the young Alice and the old.</p>
<p>In 1932, Alice Liddell Hargreaves, age 80, travels to New York to attend a celebration of Lewis Carroll's centenary. Confused by American culture and unable to understand the huge popularity of the Alice books, Mrs. Hargreaves begins to remember details of the childhood events that led to the writing of the stories. Was shy Carroll actually in love with her?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Made entirely in England and yet not available in England, this film seems to lead us into dark corners only for the sun to shine brightly at the end, beautifully and carefully paced and with many very talented actors, especially the young Alice. This film predates Labyrinth by only a few months, and we can see in the Mad Hatter an early and successful test piece for Labyrinths Hoddle - even better though we can see the real life actor inspiring Hoddles face, as played by Ken Campbell. A must see companion piece to Labyrinth. Trek fans can note that Cheryl (Gates) McFadden (TNG Dr Crusher) also choreographed puppet movement for this movie.</p>
