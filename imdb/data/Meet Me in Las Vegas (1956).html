<h1>Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chuck Redwell is a gambling cowboy who discovers that he's lucky at the roulette wheel if he holds hands with dancer Marie. However, Marie doesn't like to hold hands with him, at least not to begin with...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All I remembered was a silly plot, with gambler Dan Dailey and ballerina Cyd Charisse winning at roulette every time they hold hands. It's unimposing stuff, and while screenwriter Isobel Lennart always gave her women characters more to act than most of her male counterparts, this is a pretty thin plot peg. But this wide-screen MGM musical from 1956 does have a lot to recommend it. Dailey, much more of an actor than most dancers, is at his most appealing here, in a glove-fitting role (you only wish he had more to dance), and Charisse, never the most nimble of actresses, loosens up more than usual, looks as sensational as ever, and dances like a dream. There's a fun supporting cast including Lili Darvas, Agnes Moorehead, Jim Backus, a scheming Paul Henreid, and Liliane Montevecchi (decades later, Charisse would replace her on Broadway in "Grand Hotel"), a slew of specialty acts, and, best of all, a Cinemascope look at what Vegas looked like in the '50s. What great cars, great clothes, great colors, how luxe and overstuffed it all is. Produced by Joe Pasternak, who never had as sure a touch as his Metro counterpart Arthur Freed, and directed anonymously by Roy Rowland, it's longer than it has to be and has few surprises. But there's plenty to look at, and we do buy the central romance and want these two to end up together.</p>
