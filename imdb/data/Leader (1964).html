<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was bored , had nothing to do and this was on TV.. well,, I really luved it.. and i've watched it over a few times now... its about a talented young law student and journalist who's kinda ringleader of a band of loafers... the first part ids full of comedy and romance... I was only 15 when i first watched this.. and i turned into a dilip kumar's fan. the second part becomes a sort of thriller... with the assassination of a political leader.. the plot is complicated.. but it slowly and beautifully unravels the performance of dilip is superb, comedy, romance, action and tragedy u name it. the locations are nice too.. watch out for the song on telephone( dilip teases the princess on the phone) and the song in the magnificent taj mahal. to conclude i would say, its a political thriller with ingredients of comedy, romance, lots of suspense...9.75/10</p>
