<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is still one of my favorite movies of all time ....and absolutely the best acting by an actress in all the years since then. Streep is magnificent and flawless.  The "choice" scene was so horrifying to me (a mother of a young son and daughter at the time) that it took me several years before I could watch the movie without skipping past that part.  It is such a small scene, yet its impact was so haunting and so horrifying - I can't think of any other scene in a movie that has affected me like that.  Kline was terrific as well, and the musical score is beautiful and memorable.  All in all, a wonderful film, and a perfect 10 from me.  What a gifted actress!</p>
