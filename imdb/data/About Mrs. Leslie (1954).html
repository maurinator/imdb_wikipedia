<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a movie. I don't know how or where to start to rave and praise it. The acting, the story. So very believable, and for a woman to live with a man outside of wedlock in the 1930's...well, unheard of then...or maybe not so. This is the story of a woman who accepts a man who can only offer her a six week a year commitment. But, oh, it is so worth it. You have to see this movie to fully understand it. The casting of both Shirley and Robert were perfection. So realistic. A very, very poignant and touching piece. Youth vs. age, many subplots, but done in a superior way of flashbacks. The character of Mrs. Leslie is one who has learned all about life's foibles and disappointments. She has her memories of her "Mr. Leslie, honey," to sustain her. I cannot praise this movie enough. I have it on VHS, recorded from TV. I cannot locate it on DVD. See this if and when it replays on television. It is amazing.</p>
