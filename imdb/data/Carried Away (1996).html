<h1>Carried Away (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joseph Svenden is a middle-aged schoolteacher who lives on a farm with his dying mother. In his simple life there are no excitements, even in long-time relationship with a widow. However, when 17-year old beauty enrolls in his class, Joseph would soon end up in her arms. After that, Joseph is torn between the passion and feeling that he is doing something wrong.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Often-volatile Dennis Hopper really gets a chance at a thoughtful dramatic performance here playing a Texas farmer and schoolteacher, semi-engaged to a fellow instructor, who is seduced by a teenage temptress. Low-keyed picture doesn't aim for shocking revelations or melodrama; it's exceedingly straightforward and just a bit dull. Good acting by Hopper, Amy Irving, Amy Locane (from "Cry Baby"), and Priscilla Pointer, though the movie could really use some adrenaline. Some nude scenes, filmed without a hint of titillation, are remarkable only for the fact that no one, including director Bruno Barreto, is energized by the sex--it's all kept very mundane. ** from ****</p>
