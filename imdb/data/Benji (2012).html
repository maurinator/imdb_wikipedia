<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must say i am really surprised that I'm not only the first to review this documentary, but that I'm the first to give it 10/10. A great, and greatly tragic story that is told without too much bias when it would be easy to let emotion cloud the truth. A must watch. The film not only captures the story of Benjamin Marshall, but also of a city along with its inherent struggles, and a terrible felling of what if? I don't want to take away from the film, but i will say not knowing the story before i watched the film took me on an emotional journey which at the end left me asking questions and feeling overwhelmed, and any documentary the can take you on that journey is worth a watch at least. Do yourself a favor.</p>
