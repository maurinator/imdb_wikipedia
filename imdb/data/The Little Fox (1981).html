<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vuk, the little fox lives happily among his many siblings in their parents' home. As he is livelier and snappier than the others, one day he wanders into the forest alone. As soon as he arrives home, he discovers that his whole family has disappeared. Only later, he comes to know that the responsible are the feared humans, the hunters (called among animals the 'bare-skins'). But luckily for Vuk, his old uncle Karak starts to patronize him, and the seasoned elder brings Vuk up to be the most cunning and successful fox in the forest.</p>
<p>Famous, great hunters, better stay away, here comes Vuk! (They say he is cunning as a fox!)</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In case of movies that were commented by a lot of users, it might work, but to give 5.8 for this movie when out of 40 votes (at present) only 3 was below seven, and 42% voted this movie 10, it is really not working. This movie is simply great, beautiful, moving, I loved it with my all heart as a child and cried together with the other kids in the kindergarten...I don't repeat the story, but this is really a uniquely nice movie and it is really a shame that it seems to be some 5.8 crap only because of this weighted rating.</p>
