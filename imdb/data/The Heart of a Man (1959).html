<h1>The Heart of a Man (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frankie, an out-of-work sailor, meets Bud, a tramp who claims he is a millionaire. Bud gives him a shilling and promises him that if he can make £100 from it, he will be given £1,000. Armed with this, Frankie goes off to pursue his singing career and win the heart of Julie, the girlfriend of upper-class criminal Tony.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Standard rags-to-riches story, a star vehicle for Frankie Vaughan, although Tony Newley does his best to dominate proceedings with his ad libs and rather bizarre overacting. Anne Heywood, as the love interest, seems to be there simply as a mannequin for Eileen Idare's somewhat ridiculous dresses.Still, Tony Britton carries off the role of the upper-class criminal with ease, and there's good supporting performances from Michael Medwin and Harry Fowler as two of his henchmen. Overall, though, Frankie Vaughan's unconvincing acting lets the whole thing down, and the film meanders along to an all-too-obvious conclusion.</p>
