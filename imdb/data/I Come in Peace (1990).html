<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack Caine (Dolph Lundgren) is a Houston vice cop who's forgotten the rule book. His self-appointed mission is to stop the drugs trade and the number one supplier Victor Manning. Whilst involved in an undercover operation to entrap Victor Manning, his partner gets killed, and a sinister newcomer enters the scene... Along with F.B.I. agent Lawrence Smith, the two investigate a spate of mysterious deaths; normal non-junkies dying of massive heroin overdoses and bearing the same horrific puncture marks on the forehead. This, coupled with Caine's own evidence, indicates an alien force is present on the streets of Houston, killing and gathering stocks of a rare drug found only in the brain... Caine is used to fighting the toughest of criminals, but up to now they've all been human...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My video of this film is called "Dark Angel". It's a great Dolph film, I also like 'The Punisher' and 'Big Showdown in Little Tokyo'. Dark Angel is a bit different...I enjoyed watching the relationships unfold between him and his police partner and him and his girlfriend. The scientist character is brilliantly overacted...although I know some computer programmers who are stressed out in the same manner! Some years ago, whilst watching the video at my brother's house in surround sound, my son walked into the room during a bit where a disk is flying around a room striking things...and he actually ducked! It still is the best bit of surround that I ever heard. Caine's final words to the alien are classic!</p>
