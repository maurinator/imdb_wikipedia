<h1>Twin Falls Idaho (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Francis and Blake Falls are conjoined twins who live in a neat little room in a rundown hotel. While sharing some organs, Blake is always fit and Francis is very sickly. Into their world comes a young lady, who turns their world upside down. She gets involved with Blake, and convinces the two to attend a Halloween party, where they can pass themselves off as wearing a costume. Eventually Francis becomes really ill, and they have to be separated. They then face the physical and mental strains that come from their proposed separation. Viewers will be inclined to believe that the two are really Siamese twins, but in fact they are simply real-life brothers playing the parts convincingly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Twin Falls Idaho" is amazing not just for how much really good material it packs into its first hour, but for how it parlays all that good material into even better material for the film's second half.  Although Francis Falls tips the movie's hand when he gives us his thoughts about sad endings that become happy endings, the unexpectedly original way in which these thoughts are illuminated is a genuine treat.And what can be said about the acting?  Neither Michael nor Mark Polish strikes a false note in what could have been embarrassingly showy turns.  The quiet intensity of their attachment to one another and their relationship to the world around them.  Michelle Hicks also finds a way to turn a character who could have been an instant cliche into a person whose feelings we care about.This film is a rare gem you will want to see more than once.</p>
