<h1>Hero and the Terror (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Danny O'Brien is back in action fighting the notorious Simon Moon, also known as The Terror. Three years earlier O'Brien had single-handedly captured The Terror and was called Hero by the people of L.A. Now Simon has escaped and has started killing women again, and O'Brien is the only man who can stop him.</p>
<p>Three years ago the city was plagued by Simon Moon, a serial killer, who was so terrible that he was dubbed, "THE TERROR". Danny O'Brien is a cop who figured out where he was hiding and was confronted by Moon; Moon nearly killed him. But O'Brien through a stroke of luck managed to subdue Moon. The city and the press were so grateful to have "THE TERROR" stopped that O'Brien was christened,"HERO", which he feels that he doesn't deserve. Moon was confined to a psychiatric facility; he tried to escape in one of their ambulances and it went off a cliff and he was believed to be dead. Three years later, when a theater that the city spent millions on renovating was opened, one of the guests, a woman, disappeared. She would be found later near the theater, dead. And she appears to have been killed in the same manner that Simon Moon killed his victims. While everyone believes that Simon Moon is dead, O'Brien is a bit skeptical. The mayor then schedules a press conference wherein he expects O'Brien to tell them that the killer is not Simon Moon. But O'Brien doesn't believe that is so, especially when he gets the medical examiners report. The Mayor convinces O'Brien that it would be in the city's best interest if they continue to believe that Moon is dead, so that no will try to copycat him. While O'Brien agrees, he is wondering if he is ready to face him again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cop Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) starts having nightmares about his heroic arrest of serial killer Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran) from three years prior. This is bad news because it is messing up his relationship with his pregnant psychiatrist girlfriend Kay (Brynn Thayer). Oh, and it also sucks because Moon has escaped from prison and started killing again while hiding out inside a recently remodeled movie theater in downtown Los Angeles. Norris only did a few films in his career that fell under the horror category (this, SILENT RAGE, HELLBOUND); if SILENT RAGE was his take on FRANKENSTEIN, then HERO AND THE TERROR is Chuck's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. Of course, I'm a sucker for any horror movie set in a theater, so I still enjoyed this on a revisit even if it isn't very good. Moon has all the personality of Andrew from HELL NIGHT (1981) and the same "heavy on the corpses and candles" home design sensibilities as Jason circa Friday THE 13th PART 2 (1981). Novelist Michael Blodgett adapted his own book for this along with co-writer Dennis Shryack, who has some good horror credits with THE CAR (1977) and MURDER BY PHONE (1982). The plot is pretty flimsy and the drama between Norris and his crazy seeming fianc√© is really rough. Their birthday dinner scene is really odd to the point I was screaming for Norris to ditch this crazy chick. Also, the idea that Norris is the only one who believes the killer is in the theater after three mysterious deaths is laughable. Still, there are some memorable bits including a final showdown that fulfills my wildest theater setting fantasies. Co-starring Steve James as Norris' partner and Ron O'Neal as The Mayor.</p>
