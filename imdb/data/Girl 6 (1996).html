<h1>Girl 6 (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This Spike Lee film examines the life of an aspiring actress in New York. She is upset by the treatment of women in the movie industry during one of her screen tests with 'QT'. Out of work and desperate for money, she decides to take a job as a phone-sex operator. Here, unlike her previous dealings with potential employers, her (female) boss is kind, caring, and sensitive. Later, she begins to get too engrossed in her work and starts to lose touch with reality, represented by her friend and neighbor, Jimmy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is by far one of my favourite Spike Lee movies, along with "She's Gotta Have It"  It follows the trials and tribulations of an actress trying to make it in New York City.  She decides to take a job as a phone sex operator until she gets an acting job.  Theresa Randle gives an excellent performance throughout. The musical score by Prince, which includes some of his classic '80s tunes, makes this a movie that you can watch over and over again.  Too bad it's not available on DVD, like some of Spike's other movies.</p>
