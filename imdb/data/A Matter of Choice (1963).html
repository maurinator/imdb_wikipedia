<h1>A Matter of Choice (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two youths accidentally cause a man's death, and inadvertently reveal his liaison with a married woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's been about 15 years since I saw this film but I recall it was actually a very good film. It deals with the implications of everyday decisions, in this case the decision made by two people over which route to take home, and how these fateful decisions can effect a wide circle of people. Low budget and black and white with no standout acting performances, it is nevertheless coherent and thought provoking.</p>
