<h1>Buffalo Bill in Tomahawk Territory (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Made during the period when Clayton Moore had been replaced on the Lone Ranger television series by John Hart, but actually appears to have been made during the dawn of the sound era because of the excessive amounts of stock footage culled from earlier westerns made by producer Edward Finney, who never let much film from his productions be used only once, which accounts for some Monogram stock with Tex Ritter and Tris Coffin. Story concerns the efforts of Buffalo Bill to protect the Indian's land from a gang who want to get the gold buried there. The outlaws disguise themselves as Indians and raid and plunder the settlers in order to blame the tribe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Clayton Moore will be forever known as that masked rider of the plains, the Lone Ranger. During a brief sabbatical from the series (involuntary ??), Moore starred in this film concerning that other frontier legend, Buffalo Bill Cody.Moore dons the buckskins in this action-filled, historically inaccurate matin√©e entry. The script and cast are adequate, with no particular standouts. Clayton Moore as always is terrific here and is very believable in the title role.This is a so-so B-flick, made interesting mostly for the casting of Moore as the legendary Indian fighter. Worth watching for that alone...</p>
