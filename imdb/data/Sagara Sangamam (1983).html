<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>very good movie. good direction brilliant music and brilliant performances by the artists.the drunkard who is also a columnist in a new paper comments about a dancer for some erratic movements. the girl and her fianc√© call the drunkard and try to insult him ,but, insulted by him . he shows the dance movements to the dancer. it is later known that the dancer's mother and the drunkard were lovers in their younger days. the girl keeps hating the drunkard but she is forced to take lessons from him. even the romance is handled in much more mature and appreciable manner.brilliant performance by drunkard / dance master , drunkard's friend , dancer , dancer's mom .</p>
