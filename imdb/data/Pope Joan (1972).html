<h1>Pope Joan (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie is based on the medieval legend of Pope Joan, who was made Pope for a brief period around 855 A.D. Although it is questionable that Pope Joan really did exist, this movie presents her existence as fact, and portrays her relationships with other notables of the time.</p>
<p>In medieval Europe, a pious young woman becomes a scholar of theology, disguises herself as a man, rises through the Catholic Church hierarchy and is elected Pope.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw the film on TV, quite by chance. I found the film gripping: the story, the atmosphere and the historical detail. I have no religious interest, but it made me curious to find out more about 'pope Joan'. The film is a work of fiction based on a legend, with very little factual basis. Nevertheless, one could really get a sense of life in those times (9th century Europe). Poverty, illiteracy, corruption. The place of women. The violence, that life was worth very little. Sadly, I think much of the world is just like that today, so perhaps it is a little window on humanity.</p>
