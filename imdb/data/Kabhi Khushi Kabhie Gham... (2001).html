<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham known as K3G is one of the Best Bollywood Movies of all time. It was a Big Budget movie with the Big Giants of Bollywood together in one movie. It has the biggest opening in UK reaching Number 3 in the UK Top 10. It was directed by Karan Johar after the Huge Success of Kuch kuch hota hai, This film looked like a instant Hit judging from the trailers and Star Cast. Amitabh is Great in a powerful performance, Shah Rukh Khan is Superb in a wonderful role. Kajol is amusing and annoying, but her character is suppose to be dim, so she did entertain for a bit. Hritek Roshan is Fantastic in one of his best performances. Jaya Bachchan is Marvellous and full of emotions as the mother. Rani Mukherjee is Good in a small role. The only person that gave this film a slight weakness is Kareena Kapoor. Her character was so unrealistic and annoying, in reality if a person acted like that in college then they would of been laughed at bye me. This was a real delightful movie to enjoy watching with the family, but Kareena's character was a bit of a slapper, who did not look pretty and over acts. Overall a Great Movie.</p>
