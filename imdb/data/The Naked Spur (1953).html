<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This western achieves something remarkable, it brings back your sensitivity. From the start of the film, any scene that shows  either human beings or even an animal being shot, you feel the bitter taste of it. The bounty hunter which in so many movies was the hero, is shown here with all his indignity. It was not an easy role for James Stewart and he comes out beautifully. Janet Leigh is excellent as a tomboy. As for the scenery of the Rocky Mountains with the predominance of the green of the trees with the snowy mountains on the background, it is on the same level with everything else on this film which can be rated as one of the best westerns ever made.</p>
