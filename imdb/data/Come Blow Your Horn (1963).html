After giving up a woman who lives in the same building, Alan gets beaten by the husband of another conquest. Scared off, Alan alienates his favorite girl friend, Connie, staying away from all commitment.

Following their marriage, Alan helps their parents reconcile, works seriously in the family business and turns his bachelor pad over to his brother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Looks like a stage play......feels like a stage play.....acted as if the audience is sitting fifty yards away.....they just couldn't shake the roots of this production. Certainly, an insignificant Simon property, raised beyond oblivion by its casting. I'm not sure why they just didn't change the age of Sinatra's character to his actual 48 - he doesn't look remotely 39 - actually, he looks about 55. Tony Bill's role would play better on stage, where his over-emoting wouldn't be quite so grating.Yes, the parents are perfectly cast, if you can tolerate the stereotypical Jewish mother and father, screeching incessantly. What children WOULDN'T run away from that?The bachelor pad is certainly hip Early 60s - and unbelievable (regardless of the explanation of its affordability).The song interlude is a bit jarring, although if they had to do it, it certainly works best where it is.Overall, not a film I'll watch again.</p>
