<h1>Sphere (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>1000 feet below the ocean, navy divers discover an object half-a-mile long. A crack team of scientists are deployed to the site in Deepsea Habitats. What they find boggles the mind as they discover a perfect metal sphere. What is the secret behind the sphere? Will they survive the mysterious 'manifestations'? Who or what is creating these? They may never live to find out.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin; the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams; and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher and Jane Edmunds. Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present day, they will probably die. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm on the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive the power of the mysterious sphere?</p>
<p>In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from its fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old.</p>
<p>A spaceship is discovered under three hundred years' worth of coral growth at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I gave it a 9 due to the fact that they didn't explain everything out for me. So often I watch movies and can easily predict everything that is going on, and how it is going to turn out. This movie is not that way. Great suspense from beginning to end, and it will leave you thinking when it is over.If the writers/producers were to tell all about the plot, the best part of the movie (not being exactly sure what is going on) would be ruined.As they talk to the ''unknown'' creature through the computer, this gives the movie a much more eerie feel.A must watch for anyone who likes movies.Rent it or buy it today.</p>
