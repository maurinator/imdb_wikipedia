<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>LETTERS TO JULIET  CATCH IT ( B+ ) Letters to Juliet is a very simple and pure love story. This is a story about Amanda Seyfried who while vacationing in Italy finds an unanswered letter to Juliet and she story begins when she answers the letter. After few days a guy and his grandmother shows up to see who wrote the letter. After that the journey for the lost love (Lorenzo) through beautiful locations of Italy starts. The movie starts off normal but the moment Vanessa Redgrave enters the screen along with her grandson Christopher Egan, the movie picks up. The movie is full of simple and innocent moments with breathtaking locations of Italy, watching the stunning locations will leave you in Awe and desire to visit Italy immediately. Amanda Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and her chemistry is very enchanting with Christopher Egan. Though, her chemistry with Goal Garcia Bernal is very flat may be it also required for the script. Christopher Egan is one hell of sexy and adorable Aussi Lad though in the movie he plays British. His charming personality and chemistry with Amanda Seyfried is worth watching. Goal Garcia Bernal was OK. Vanessa Redgrave is truly elegant and graceful in this age. Franco Nero suited really well as the ultimate Lorenzo of Vanessa Redgrave. By the way Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero are couple in real life as well, isn't that amazing. Taylor Swift's song "Love Story" was a perfect fit for the movie. Oh I love the ending in the famous Romeo & Juliet balcony style, it looks simply adorable. Overall Letters to Juliet purity, simple story and breathtaking locations makes it really memorable and enjoyable.</p>
