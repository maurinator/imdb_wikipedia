<h1>Confessions of a Window Cleaner (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young Timmy starts as a window cleaner in the little company of his brother. Soon he learns that some female customers expect additional service. Young and curious as he is, he reluctantly accepts the juicy duty. However his heart belongs to Liz, who demands the highest commitment until she lets him go all the way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From first fumblings to almost wedded bliss, Confessions of a Window Cleaner follows the sexual exploits of lovable, accident prone youth Timmy Lea (Robin Askwith), who finds there's much more to window cleaning than just being a dab hand with a squeegee.During the movie's opening credits, a frustrated, virginal Timmy is seen spying on a naked woman in her flat, and on schoolgirls taking a shower (behaviour that would probably secure him a place on the sex offenders register these days). However, it's not long before the cheeky chappie gets some actual hands on experience with the opposite sex (courtesy of a stripper and a randy housewife), and then there's no stopping the bloke: anything in a skirt seems to find him sexually irresistible and, being a considerate fellow, he's only too keen to oblige.Although frequent casual sex with busty nymphomaniacs is undoubtedly fun, Timmy actually yearns for the one woman who doesn't drop her knickers the instant she claps eyes on him: pretty policewoman Elizabeth Radlett (the lovely Linda Hayden). After doing almost everything to loosen Liz's knicker elastic, our denim-clad hero tries the only trick left in the book: he proposes marriage!With most of its humour derived from moments of dubious moralitya large percentage of the film's comedy revolves around infidelity and promiscuityConfessions of a Window Cleaner is not one for the 'politically correct brigade'; on the other hand, those who enjoy bawdy comedy littered with softcore sex and innuendo should love this film to bits. There are loads of good looking dolly birds all too willing to flash the goods, some genuinely witty lines of dialogue ("I won't say 'au revoir', 'cos i'll see you again later", says Shiela White as Rosie Nogget), and plenty of faces that should be familiar to fans of British TV: it's all so very silly and so very 70s that it's hard not to enjoy.</p>
