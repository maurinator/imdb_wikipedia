<p>A description of Romania before Ceausescu's downfall, through the story of Nela. Daughter of a former colonel of the Securitate, the romanian political police. She refused to become as her sister, an agent of this Securitate, and lives with her father. After he died, she leaves Bucarest, and ends up in a little town, where she meets Mitica, a surgeon, another herself, laughing of everything.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For a Romanian who has fled Ceausescu's brutality in 1985,this film is not only a revenge but also a proof that even in the darkest political system talent can survive because everyone who is implicated in the creation of this masterpiece(director,screenwriters,actors,crew grew,studied and worked in the "socialist paradise". I have seen the film twice; at first I was a little shocked by its "naturalism" and only later I realized that this was the life for at least 90% of the Romanians. Of course only somebody who grew in a communist country can fully appreciate the film's realism,its brutal black humor but I think the real message transcends this : one must fight for his ideals,there is always hope!</p>
