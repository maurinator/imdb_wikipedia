<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this on SBS, the "multi-cultural" TV channel in Australia. Although I have not seen many Indian-made films, I suspect this one is quite typical- i.e. cheap sets, ham acting and strong stereotypes.The basic plot is about a young orphaned girl who is trying to support her younger brother in a society that regards such people as having no worth. She is a victim of those who use her. Corruption is rather clumsily portrayed. As a protest movie, it lacks sophistication. There is a definite poignancy about the young woman's situation, which might be more strongly felt by someone who shares her cultural identity. For a Westerner, the cultural gap reduces the effectiveness of the film.</p>
