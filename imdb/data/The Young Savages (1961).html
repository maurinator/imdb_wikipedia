<h1>The Young Savages (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A district attorney investigates the racially charged case of three teenagers accused of the murder of a blind Puerto Rican boy. He begins to discover that the facts in the case aren't exactly as they seem to be.</p>
<p>After three teenage hoods stab blind Puerto Rican Roberto Escalante, assistant DA Hank Bell is tasked with prosecuting the case. He's looking for convictions for first degree murder for all three of the boys, even 15 year-old Danny DiPace, son of his old girlfriend, Mary DiPace. He grew up in the neighborhood and investigates the case with Lt. Gunderson. He learns that Escalante may have pulled a knife and was actually one of the leaders of the Puerto Rican gang that fought regularly with their Italian opponents. Bell's wife is upset at the prospect that he's seeking the death penalty for kids and he thinks she's just a liberal living in her own little perfect world. As he gathers more evidence however, he begins to see that it's all far more complex than it first appeared. He pursues justice in the case.</p>
<p>In an area of Spanish Harlem controlled by the Puerto Rican-American gang the Horsemen, fifteen year old Roberto Escalante, a blind boy, is stabbed to death in broad daylight by three other youth in front of on-lookers. The three are apprehended and are supposed members of the rival Italian-American gang, the Thunderbirds: seventeen year old Arthur Reardon, sixteen year old Anthony 'Batman' Aposto, and fifteen year old Danny di Pace. The district attorney's office, led by Dan Cole, appoints Hank Bell to prosecute. Dan's choice is partly because Hank suggested first degree murder charges, which if achieved would help Dan's gubernatorial bid, but also because Hank knows the racially charged Harlem turf wars well since he grew up there. The one person who openly disagrees with Hank on prosecuting on first degree murder is his privileged wife, Karin Bell, who feels such charges especially against a fifteen year old are inhumane. Knowing the neighborhood and its people well, Hank investigates on his own, which places his and his family's life in danger as both sides try to use whatever methods of persuasion on Hank, including violence, implied or real, to get what they want. But Hank also tries to find out motivation for killing a seemingly non-gang related boy, who the three claim wielded a knife on them first and thus who they killed in self-defense. Arthur and Anthony's motivations become clear, but Danny is the big question mark, he who is deemed a good, bright boy by most around him, despite his solidarity in the killing with Arthur and Anthony. That investigation may be helped or hindered by the fact that Hank once seriously dated Danny's mother, Mary di Pace, who stands by her son's innocence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Young Savages (1961)Released six months before "West Side Story," this elegant story of New York gang violence in the ghettos of uptown Manhattan is as powerful, and as beautiful. And the title makes clear that the movie is pointing to a new social problem, the immigrant gangs (Italian and Puerto Rican in this case). But in most ways "The Young Savages" couldn't be more different. At the heart of it all is district attorney Hank Bell, previously Bellini, played by Burt Lancaster in what struck me as possibly the most subtle role in his career. That's an absurd thing to know for sure, and Lancaster is so good so often it's easier to just say he is terrific, but if you know him from some noir films or from "Birdman of Alcatraz" or "Judgement at Nuremberg" you might know a more overtly dramatic actor. Here he is restrained in a perfect way, his pauses and his turned head adding depth to his apparent struggle with how to get at the truth as the events and the witnesses start to swirl out of control. A virtuosic performance.The themes are hot topic issues layered with good old fashioned love and loyalty. Mostly we have first and second generation immigrant trying to define themselves, to stake out a place in the city, and to fend off competing immigrant groups and sometimes invade their territory. Bell's own Italian-American background makes him understand the problems of youth violence from the inside, but he has avoided being identified as Italian, and even his wife doesn't quite accept him as an immigrant, but wants to see him as more like her, a Vassar girl. Which he is not, even if sometimes he passes as a Yankee or as an old stock New Yorker.Much of the movie is that wonderful quite and deliberate investigation of the crime, the facts, the witnesses, the evidence. And we see this through Bell's eyes. The last long section is pure courtroom drama, and it's as good as courtroom dramas get, gutsy and tense. In the biggest sense, real justice is achieved, even at the expense of some reputations or expectations around the D.A. (who of course is supposed to always want and get the death penalty). By the final turns of events, you see the story is really about a single man who struggles against his own bias and does the right thing, and does it well. Director John Frankenheimer once again pulls off a movie with social significance that doesn't forget it's roots in theatrical drama.Cinematographer Lionel Lindon is an old pro, starting with some 1940s boilerplate movies sprinkled with some gems ("The Blue Dahlia" is a great one) and then scores of television shows. And the next year, 1962, he shot "The Manchurian Candidate" which succeeds partly for its amazing visual pizazz. Here, there are both moments of beauty and of cacophony. The fight scenes, and the dazzling murder that starts the movie off, are mini-masterpieces. But even quiet moments are given anxiety and drama by shooting at sharp angles or by moving in close. It's quite a beautiful experience to watch this, even as the events are tumultuous.</p>
