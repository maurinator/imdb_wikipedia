<h1>I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A true story about Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker Barbara Gordon's Valium addiction and her desperate attempts to kick the habit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A restructuring of Barbara Gordon's memoir about a successful female TV producer who is hooked on Valium--and who tries to kick cold turkey, with devastating results. A subplot regarding cancer patient Geraldine Page is expanded for the film (and seemingly takes over, even contributing the title in the film's dialogue!), but this didn't bother me as Jill Clayburgh's lead portrayal carries the movie and gives it strength and sarcastic bite. There are all sorts of conflicted emotions running rampant through the material, and the direction (while not smooth) does manage to sort it all out for the viewer. This was the first time I had ever seen Dianne Wiest in anything and she really impressed me as Clayburgh's therapist (however, Wiest uses all the acting tricks we've seen her do since then, and frankly they're starting to become old hat). The film has some editing problems and looks a little muddy, but I found Clayburgh's struggle intense and real, and her performance brave. *** out of ****</p>
