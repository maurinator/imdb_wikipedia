<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is my favourite Hindi film featuring two of my favourites - Rajendra Kumar and Sadhana. Of course, it is not soley because of these stars - real stars! -that i love this film. This film has it all - drama, humour, romance and knows how to keep the suspense alive. It all starts with doctor - Rajendra Kumar - heading to Kashmir - where else in the Hindi films of 1960s? - and falling in love with Sadhana, well only after a humorous fracas on the plane. From then on its romance in the form of rajendra kumar singing, courtesy of Mohd. Rafi, and then you get beautiful songs like nargisee mastana. But a Hindi film is never a Hindi film unless it has a bit of tragedy thrown in it, and do you expect anything else when legendary Rajendra Kumar is in this film? He really knows how to string a tragic note with his emoting which is endearing. As for Sadhana, she is beautiful and matches Kumar all the way, and she shows how it is done. There is something natural about the yesteryear stars that current crop of actors lack big time. As for the supporting actors, Feroz khan, Nazima and Nazir Hussain lend a solid support.What is the tragedy Rajendra Kumar gets? why does he keep away from Sadhana and dumps her? Will Feroz Khan marry Sadhana instead? What will happen.... You will have to see it yourself.!</p>
