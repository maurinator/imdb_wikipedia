<h1>Double Impact (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jean Claude Van Damme plays a dual role as Alex and Chad, twins separated at the death of their parents. Chad is raised by a family retainer in Paris, Alex becomes a petty crook in Hong Kong. Seeing a picture of Alex, Chad rejoins him and convinces him that his rival in Hong Kong is also the man who killed their parents. Alex is suspicious of Chad, especially when it comes to his girlfriend.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, American businessman Paul Wagner, his wife Katherine Wagner, and their 6 month old twin sons Chad and Alex are watching a parade. When the parade ends, Paul and his business partner Nigel Griffith, who run Griffith-Wagner Enterprises, step up to a podium and dedicate the Victoria Harbour Tunnel, which is an underwater tunnel that connects Hong Kong Island to the mainland. That night, Paul, Katherine, and the twins are on their way home when Paul notices a carload of Chinese men following them. Paul uses his CB radio to alert his friend Frank Avery to the situation. Paul and Katherine arrive home with the twins a few minutes later, and see that waiting for them is a gang of Chinese men led by a musclebound assassin named Moon. Moon and his men shoot both Paul and Katherine dead, and plan to kill the twins -- until Frank shows up and kills all of Moon's henchmen, but Frank gets shot while Moon escapes. Chad and Alex end up separated. 25 years later, Chad is a martial arts expert and aerobics trainer in Los Angeles. Frank raised Chad in Paris, France after the murders. Frank talks Chad into going to Hong Kong with him. Frank has decided that it's time to get the twins together and get revenge, and reclaim what's rightfully theirs. They board an airplane to Hong Kong. Hours later, they arrive in Hong Kong. On that night, they go to a Mah Jongg Parlor and go inside. Chad is approached by a blond haired woman who obviously thinks he's someone else, then a man who looks like Chad knocks Chad out cold. The man is Alex, and the woman is Alex's fiancée Danielle Wilde, who thought Chad was Alex. She, Chad, and Alex are all surprised to be told by Frank that Chad and Alex are brothers. Alex and Danielle have a hard time believing it. Frank explains that Paul supervised the construction of the Victoria Harbour Tunnel. Halfway into the project, Paul encountered financial problems, so he pulled in Nigel Griffith as an equity partner. Nigel got his money from a secret loan, courtesy of Hong Kong drug kingpin Raymond Zhang. When the tunnel was completed, and Paul's expertise was no longer needed, Nigel and Raymond had Paul and Katherine murdered by Moon's hit team. Chad and Alex were supposed to die, too, so they could not come back and claim what's rightfully theirs, what Nigel and Raymond stole from Paul, which was his business and the tunnel. Alex reluctantly believes Frank about this story, but Danielle continues to refuse to believe it. Alex, Chad, and Frank head out on Alex's boat. A few minutes after setting off, Alex's boat is approached by another boat. Alex allows three Chinese men aboard to look over a couple of cars that are on Alex's boat. As this is going on, two police boats approach. Alex throws the three Chinese men overboard, then while Alex heads to the boat's steering wheel, Chad and Frank send the cars overboard and blow the cars up. It seems that Alex is a smuggler. Later, Frank, Chad, Alex, and Danielle are at a restaurant, where Alex tells Chad and Frank that Danielle has been an employee of Nigel's company for the past 5 years. That's why Danielle refuses to believe Nigel's part in Paul and Katherine's murders. Chad takes a taxi cab out to the hotel where he and Frank have been staying, but before he can go inside, he is approached by a group of Chinese men who think he's Alex. Moon forces Chad into a car with Raymond, and taken to a boat yard. Raymond wants Alex's help in smuggling drugs, and he mistakenly has Moon place Chad in a cargo container and beat Chad up, trying to convince Alex to give in. Chad is then locked up in the container, taken downtown, and dumped out onto a street. After Chad is treated for his injuries, he and Alex decide that it's time to work together against Nigel and Raymond.</p>
<p>Twin brothers are separated when their parents are murdered but 25 years later they re-unite in order to avenge their parents' death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As mere babies, twins Alex and Chad are separated when their parent's are brutally murdered by Triads who had no further use for the twin's parents. One child is rescued by their nanny, the other by the family's bodyguard Frank Avery. Alex grows up rough in the orphanage where his nanny leaves him and becomes a criminal in the underworld, while Chad becomes a ladies' man and karate teacher under the guidance of Frank. After several decades, Frank finds Alex and reunites the two brothers in time to battle the same triads who are still in business.The plot to this film opens with such violence in front of children that it alters the paths their lives were going to take. Surely this film shows the effects that young children witnessing violence can have  in this case the children are so badly affected that they both grow up to become Jean-Claude Van Damme! Aside from this terrible event, they come together decades later just as those that murdered their parents are doing a big deal. Of course the whole plot is silly and the whole idea behind the plot is to present two Van Damme's as some sort of major selling point  and I suppose for some it is. Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot, this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's star(s?) and it is just about enjoyable on that level, even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!Attempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme, who's delivery is as reliable as ever  and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end (one in shadows, the other with a drum). Shaw makes for an annoying love interest  in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain  so hammy it should have been between bread.Overall this is not a very good film but, did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.</p>
