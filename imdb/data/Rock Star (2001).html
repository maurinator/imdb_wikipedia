<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chris Cole was born to rock. His longtime girlfriend Emily believes his talent could take him all the way - but Chris worships at the altar of Bobby Beers, the fiery frontman for heavy metal legends Steel Dragon. By day, Chris still lives at home with his parents and spends his days repairing copy machines. But when Chris takes the stage, fronting Pennsylvania's premiere Steel Dragon tribute band, all of that disappears. Chris Cole is Bobby Beers - mesmerizing audiences with his perfect imitation of Beers' electrifying vocals. The night his bandmates boot him out of the group, Chris is devastated - until an unexpected phone call changes his life forever: He, Chris Cole, has been tapped to replace Bobby Beers as the lead singer of Steel Dragon. In an instant, Chris rockets to the dizzying heights of sudden stardom, rising from devotee to icon, from rock fan to rock god - the wanna-be who got to be. So what happens when an average guy gets everything he wants - and discovers it's not enough?</p>
<p>Rock Star is based on Tim "Ripper" Owens, who initially was in a Judas Priest cover band. He then left to join the real Judas Priest.</p>
<p>Lead singer of a tribute band becomes lead singer of the real band he idolizes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought that it would be stupid and boring (and yes, at times, it was both), but there were enough quirks in it to make it really different and interesting.First of all, I found it immensely amusing that Chris' parents were totally into his rock 'n' roll lifestyle and it was his brother who was the wet blanket instead.  Also, I liked how Jennifer Aniston, as his girlfriend, handled the situation.  Instead of being totally immature and jealous and breaking up with him in a screaming match with accusations flying everywhere, she calmly tells him that this is his time and his dream and although she is sad that she doesn't have a bigger part in it, she is content to go do something she wants to.Also, I watched this movie on DVD and I would totally recommend this way to view it.  If you listen to the director commentary, he tells you that there are artists from Slaughter, Dokken, Third Eye Blind, and Verve Pipe among others that play the musicians (including Jason Bonham).  Therefore, these guys really contributed a lot of input as to whether the movie was realistic.  As for the guy who commented that there was no connection to Judas Priest, the director said that the studded vest, hat, and collar seen at the Steel Dragon house was a direct reference to Judas Priest.  Also, that the lead singer of Steel Dragon turned out to be gay.So, if you like rock movies I would totally recommend this one!!</p>
