<h1>El revoltoso (1951)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since I was a kid, I had enjoyed classic Mexican cinema, especially that of the comedy genre. This movie is, by far, one of the most entertaining black and white films ever made. It is hard to see German Valdez "Tin Tan" involved on such improbable situations as this one, except perhaps, "Simbad el Mareado". Gorgeous girls, clever dialog, silly situations, a perfect casting and musical scenes that complement a very entertaining story make this movie a true jewel of the genre that will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film has the usual gang of great actors: Wolf Ruvinskis, José René Ruiz "Tun Tun", Juan Garcia and Marcelo Chavez, led, of course by Tin Tan in the role of a very mischievous character that puts everyone at trouble with his unwanted comments. It also has its dose of action: there is an incredible scene at the ending, where Tin Tan climbs to the top of the Mexico City Cathedral, that impressed me since I was a kid and saw this movie on TV for the first time. I still wonder if this was performed by him or a double. If you are searching for the perfect Tin Tan movie, this one has to be it.</p>
