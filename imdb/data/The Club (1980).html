<p>Boardroom and dressing-room intrigues spill on to the field at the Australian Rules football club.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Club is a terrific Australian comedy drama about the political infighting and boardroom battles at a failing Australian Rules Football club (that curious mixture of rugby, basketball and volleyball so beloved of Aussies) where commercial considerations are taking over from love of the game - hardly the most promising subject matter on paper, but David Williamson's sharp script and strong performances make it really fly. Graham Kennedy steals the honours with a great performance as the new chairman, who, for all his pomposity, genuinely loves the club and the game - unlike those plotting against him, the Iago-like administrator (Alan Cassell) who never uses the word 'I' when doing the dirty on a rival and the vice president (Frank Wilson) who'll happily see his team lose if it means stopping anyone breaking his own records as a player and coach. Kennedy's scene on the pitch recalling a classic match play by play is a wonderful moment, and Jack Thompson gives a great display of genuinely supporting acting by both keeping out of his limelight but also being absolutely there in the scene. Great stuff even if you hate sports.Umbrella's Australian PAL DVD is a great package if you want to check out the film - a good widescreen transfer, a 35-minute documentary featuring Thompson, Bruce Beresford and others, half-hour documentary on David Williamson, a radio adaptation of the play, location comparison, trailer, music video and an audio of Thompson whispering a dirge-like rendition of the Collingwood Football Club Song (sung to the tune of 'Goodbye Dolly Grey') in a performance that makes Lee Marvin sound like Pavarotti! A championship disc all the way.</p>
