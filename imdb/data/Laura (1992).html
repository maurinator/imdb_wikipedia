<h1>Laura (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Urkel composes a detective yarn about 1940s-era gumshoe Johnny Danger, who is sent to protect supper club owner (and assassin target) Rachel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The 3rd season finale is an absolutely superior episode that is a real masterpiece! It follows the script of Urkel's short crime story in which he tries to figure out the murderer of Rachel. Set in the 40's the episode beautifully adapts a lot of film noir elements.Urkel is being all Humphrey Bogart, Laura the sexy vamp lady, and the drum part whenever she walks is great comedy.All the settings, like for example the bar and costumes were very well done to fit into the atmosphere. Every actor was absolutely great at it.And I loved the scene of Urkel gathering the whole family in a room and whenever he accused someone of it, he ended up killed. Very good parody of old times detective stories, give one an Agatha Christie feeling</p>
