<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The BAU heads to Los Angeles, California where two women, in separate incidents, were found murdered in the suburb of Diamond Bar. Both were young, brunette, bound in their captivity, their throats ultimately slashed, and their bodies dumped in dumpsters. Neither women was sexually assaulted, and the M.E. later finds that both women died from blunt force trauma to the back of the head, the throat slashing done postmortem. The team also learns, following interviews, that both women suffered from self-esteem issues. When a third woman, Greta Thomas, is abducted, the team believes the unsub watched domestic abuse of his father beating his mother when he was growing up, these victims being surrogates for his mother, who did not do anything to stop the abuse. In searching through old domestic abuse cases in the area hidden as "accidents" by the females, the team thinks they have found the identity of the unsub and what he is trying to accomplish with his current victims. Meanwhile, Kate and Chris have differing opinions on thirteen year old Meg asking to go to the mall with two boys Kate and Chris have never met.</p>
<p>Peter Folkmore was an abused child and is an abuser as an adult. He captures women and abuses them for not reciting the exact instruction Peter gives them.</p>
