<h1>I, a Man (1967)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I' a Man's title is taken to be a spoof on the previously released Sweedish film called I' a Women. Warhol wanted to do something similar but with a man in the main role.I' a Man belongs to WARHOL'S third stage as a movie maker,  (the first being the silent static shots of inane objects and people, the second being sound with camera movements, minimal narrative). This film shows more narrative structure and character then the one's prior to it. Morrissey's Influence is obvious with the in the camera edits.I' a Man is about a man's various interactions with different women in and around New York. In one scene there is Nico from Velvet Underground fame staving off Tom Baker's advances. The most famous scene is with the notorious Valerie Solanis, (She was the deranged lesbian who tried killing Warhol shortly after this film). Tom Baker tries picking up Valerie (who looks rather boyish) in the stairwell of her apartment. This particular scene was wonderfully re-created for the film 'I shot Andy Warhol' Although I' a Man is not boring to watch, such as Warhol's earlier stuff, it does have a tendency to make your mind wander when watching it. The film really is pretty disjointed, and does lack a story. But what makes this film interesting is the Characters assembled for the film. Like with all of Warhol's films, it's never the story that people look for, but the real infamous and famous characters that were part of the 60's counter-culture. And believe me there are plenty in this film.</p>
