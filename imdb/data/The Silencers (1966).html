<h1>The Silencers (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this, the first Matt Helm movie, we see Matt Helm coaxed out of semi-retirement by an attractive ex-partner. It seems that the evil Big O organization has a nefarious plan called "Operation: Fallout." If this plan comes to fruition, Big O will explode an atomic bomb over Alamogordo, NM, and start WWIII. Only Matt Helm can stop them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yep, that's the premise, and the beginning to the silliest spy series, before a certain dentally-challenged International Man of Mystery arrived.Dean Martin starred as Matt Helm, the lead character in a series of novels by Donald Hamilton.  The books were serious spy adventures; but, there is nothing serious about the film series.  Dean plays it tongue-in-cheek, often making fun of his own image and rivalry with fellow Rat Packer Frank Sinatra.  The films are filled with strange characters and silly gadgets.Martin has fun with the role and keeps the film rolling along, but Stella Stevens makes it memorable.  She is sexy as hell, but is such a lovable klutz that she dominates every scene.  Victor Buono gets to chew the most scenery this side of his Batman appearances.The gadgets make James Bond look like a documentary: a gun that shoots backward unless the trigger is pushed, exploding buttons, a station wagon with a fold down bed and bar, and Helm's many household appliances.These films were anything but serious, but this one is very entertaining.  The films tended to get worse with each new entry, but most of the elements work well here.  If you are looking for serious spy cinema, try 007 or Harry Palmer.  If you want some goofy fun, try this.</p>
