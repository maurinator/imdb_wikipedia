Meanwhile another detective (Perkins) has been hired to follow Berenger, and they eventually decide to work together to find out what is really going on.</p>

One of them is Mrs. Ellen McGraw, who's seriously unhappy with her marriage and has a thing for Art, the farmhand, who actually appreciates her.

In the end it turns out that things were significantly simpler than previously thought.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you like slow-moving, aimless films, you'll probably like this exercise in murky self-indulgence by writer-director Rudolph. I guess I missed the amusing parts that others seem to find. Mostly I was just bored once I realized the story-- if you want to call it that-- was going nowhere. And what's with Berenger's phony vice that only distracts. Sounds like he could use a good gargle. Of course, noir has been parodied before, and truth be told, it's an easy genre to mock. But this has to be the dimmest of the efforts, if parody is in fact what it is. To me the results aren't interesting enough to care. I guess that's one reason the film flopped at the box-office and has since fallen into well-deserved obscurity. And, oh yes, for those who find profundity in the supposed subtexts, I'll leave that to the Midnight Study Group. Good luck.</p>
