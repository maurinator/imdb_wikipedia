<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What Lies Beneath is a great movie. Its a horror movie which has less gore and more screams which works very effectively. The plot goes along at a steady un nerving pace which is great.  The references to some movies are so obvious and the music at the end was used in Psycho. This is one of the best horror movies i have seen in quite a while. If you dont see it you must see it or rent the video or better still...buy it. It really is great and faultless. Harrison Ford and Michelle Phieffer are a great on screen couple and they couldnt have got a better couple to appear. 10/10If you like this try:PsychoThe HauntingHouse on Haunted Hill</p>
