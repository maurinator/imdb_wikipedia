<p>A team of police hunt down a villain.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, so this whole movie is about a group of seemingly dim-witted cops trying to catch a genius villain.  It may seem to have a sub par plot, but the director's artistic touch more than makes up for the obvious and trite plot.  It is not a "normal" film in this respect, with slow motion techniques, etc. . .   I guess the closest thing to this (that I saw) would be Three Kings - with the bullet embedding itself into Mark Walhberg scene. A slightly bizarre and weird film in terms of technique and what the viewer expects, but still a good film.  I do have to say that this is probably one of those films that you either love or hate.  As for me, I loved it.</p>
