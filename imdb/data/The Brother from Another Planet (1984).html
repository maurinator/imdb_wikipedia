<h1>The Brother from Another Planet (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Brother is an alien who has crash-landed on Earth, in New York City. While mute, strongly empathic, and able to fix things, he resembles a Black man with strange feet. His attempt to make a place for himself in Harlem is an allegory for the immigrant experience in the United States. Meanwhile, two bounty hunters from the Brother's home planet arrive and try to capture him.</p>
<p>A slave from outer space escapes to earth. Except for his three-toed feet, he looks like an ordinary young black man. He crash-lands on Ellis Island, appropriately enough, and ends up in Harlem. There he makes friends with the owner and the regulars of a bar. Because he can fix any machine (by simply touching it), he's able to make money. He's mute, which proves more of an advantage than a disadvantage. And he can heal himself and others with nothing but his hands. His real troubles begin when two extraterrestrial bounty hunters attempt to recapture him and bring him back to where he came from.</p>
<p>A mute alien with the appearance of a black human is chased by outer-space bounty hunters through the streets of Harlem.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this film!  Lots of laughs, lots of humanity.  It's awesome that such an unknown cast can deliver such a great performance.  The guys in the bar are hysterical.  Every scene is a gem, but the card trick on the subway is one of my all time favorites.  Go rent this movie today.  10 out of 10.</p>
