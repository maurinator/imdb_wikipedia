<h1>Alfie (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>For Alfie, the only real life is sex life; only then can he kid himself he is living. Sex is not used as the working-class boy's way to 'the top'. Executive status has no appeal for Alfie. Nor has class mobility. He is quite content to stay where he is, as long as the 'birds' are in 'beautiful condition', as he assures us they are in one of the candid, over-the-shoulder asides to the camera which the film carries over from "Tom Jones". The film shows how much of the 'swinging 60's' quality of London life was a male creation, and through the dominance of the fashion photographers, a male prerogative.</p>
<p>Alfie is a young man from the working classes of London. He is confident, charming, totally self-centered and very successful with the ladies; using them for his immediate pleasure without emotional involvement and leaving a trail of emotional devastation. His callousness toward these women contrasts with the delusion that he causes no harm; he is just teaching life's lessons.</p>
<p>An unrepentant ladies' man gradually begins to understand the consequences of his lifestyle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a seriously good comedy. Michael Caine is delightfully saucy as the title  character. He ought to seem a cad, and at times he is, but he takes his lumps too, and  takes them in stride. The supporting cast is very effective, with especially excellent  performances by Jane Asher, Shelley Winters and Millicent Martin. The camera work is  also notable, and London serves as an effective backdrop. Definitely worth a look, and a  reminder  Michael Caine was as good then as he is now.</p>
