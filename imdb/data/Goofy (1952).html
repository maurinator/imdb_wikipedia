<h1>Goofy (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bandit Pistol Pete enters a lawless western town and robs a bank. The town is in desperate need of a sheriff. Enter wandering cowboy Goofy who notices a pretty girl being held up in a stagecoach robbery by Pete. Lovestruck and completely oblivious to Pete, he foils the robbery while getting to know the girl better. This earns him a reputation as a great gunslinger and he is challenged to apprehend Pete. Pete tries to get his revenge on Goofy but every attempt backfires due to Goofy's clumsiness usually directed unintentionally at Pete.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not a terribly big fan of the post-1930s Disney short cartoons, but Two-Gun Goofy (1952) is a great deal of fun. Goofy is hilarious as the unwitting hero and the gags are all good, though not terribly inventive or side-splitting. A small dose of dark humor keeps things interesting.It's interesting to compare this short with the similarly-named and much earlier short Two-Gun Mickey (1934). Both are western spoofs with Pete as the villain; however, Two-Gun Mickey features more dramatic stakes, with Pete posing a serious threat to Mickey and Minnie, while here, everything is played for laughs, even though there is a death toll on display here (as evidenced by the undertaker taking tally of Pete's victims during his opening raid). The Mickey cartoon also has more inventive visuals and better characterization on the whole, coming from a period of experimentation at the Disney studio.Still, these shorts are two different beasts, as are Mickey Mouse and the Goof themselves. If you love Goofy, westerns, or classic cartoons, then this one will be worth your time for sure.</p>
