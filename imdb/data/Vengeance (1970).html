<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>if compares SB's martial arts films with the Japanese samurai films, the SB's films and all the other similar genre films produced by other HK movies companies were nothing but child's play and big laugh. everything was shot indoor with artificial lighting, all the actors got so many shadows in 360 degrees on the ground. the screenplays usually were ridiculous, no specific time frame or historical supporting facts. actors wore funny costumes, modern hairdos, funny make-up. all the fighting scenes were played out like ballet, just looked so phony and at the same time, so childish. acting were non-exist since everybody was just acting. the ridiculous screenplays screwed up every possibility that could make a memorable film. there's no art value whatsoever in them, just laughable child play.in this film, the brother who seek revenge for his brother was a willowy young actor, wearing oiled modern hairdo and most ridiculous of all, wore custom tailored white suit, while all the other goofballs wore some traditional clothes, all the bad guys never wore their shirts buttoned up. the performances of all the actors in this film were so poor and so unreal further ruined by horrible dialog. the fighting scenes were all looked so heavily staged.there was nothing worth recommendable in this film, just shameful and disgust feelings. horrible yet at the same time, very laughable.</p>
