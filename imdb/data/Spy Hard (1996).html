Leslie Nielson and Andy Griffith.'Spy hard' is basically Naked Gun 4 with different character names and less laughs. Spy hard veers off course and Dick Steele travels to so many different locations that we lose track and don't end up caring. So, In the end, 'Spy Hard' does have some quality laughs but doesn't live up to any of Nielson's other spoofs.2.5/4 PG13- crude/sexual humor and some comic, fake violence.</p>
