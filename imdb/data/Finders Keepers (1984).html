<h1>Finders Keepers (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the run from the police and a female roller derby team, scam artist Michael Rangeloff steals a coffin and boards a train, pretending to be a soldier bringing home a dead war buddy. The train ride turns into far more than Michael bargains for.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Consider this cast, Michael O'Keefe, Beverly D'Angelo, David Wayne, Ed Lauter, Brian Dennehy, Lou Gossett, and Jim Carrey. You might reasonably expect a film that was at least watchable. Unfortunately that is far from the reality of this mistaken identities, supposed comedy. A few mild smiles relating to 'the worlds oldest train conductor' are about it. The rest gets weaker by the minute, leading to a chaotic ending that is far worse than the nonsense that precedes it. I cannot emphasize enough how badly the capable cast is wasted. Bizarre in a bad way, is the only description than applies to "Finders Keepers. About the only good thing about this total"train wreck" of a movie is that it actually has a train in it. - MERK</p>
