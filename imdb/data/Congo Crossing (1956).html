<h1>Congo Crossing (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Congotanga, West Africa, has no extradition laws; the government is controlled by foreign gangsters, headed by Carl Rittner. The latest plane from Europe carries lovely Louise Whitman, fleeing a French murder charge, and Mannering, who pays resident hit man O'Connell to kill her. Through a chain of circumstances Louise, O'Connell, and heroic surveyor David Carr end up alone in the jungle on Carr's mission to determine the true border of Congotanga... in which Rittner is keenly interested.</p>
<p>Attractive Louise Whitman catalyzes action and adventure in an African country that offers haven to foreign fugitives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film will make you sweat. I have not seen this movie since 1957, and its memory persists. The scenes of swarming tse-tse flies and jungle conditions make it well worth looking for. Interesting cast, although movie guides often don't give it high ratings, I think it should be reconsidered ... esp. in comparison to "Outbreak", "12 monkeys"; and in comparison to some more modern movies on Africa.</p>
