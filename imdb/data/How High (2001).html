<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to be biased here: I love Meth and Redman's music. Whether it's solo, in collaborations with others, or when they do an album together. these two are among the premier rappers in the industry. So despite the films heavy emphasis of promoting marijuana use, which I'm not sold on, I had to see this movie, because I'm a big fan of rap music and would rather see these guys in films over the likes of Britney and Mariah any day.How High is hilariously funny, but it's not for everybody. You have to be fans of these fine gentlemen or have a crazy sense of humour. The rappers play Silas and Jamal, two young men who live for their pot and sexing. One day, after a friend of Silas was killed in a hilarious accident, Silas and Jamal are smoking a potent type of pot that gives them a high that allows them to "see dead people", namely Ivory, the man who was killed in the accident. He is able to give them the answers to all the questions on their SATs and that allows them to go to any college they want, and so they pick Harvard.The film has them doing their thing, turning Harvard upside down with their decidedly different attitude and angering the dean (Obba Babatunde, with his name as Dean Cain, after the actor from Superman:The Series). There are some crazy scenes in this film, such as when they run out of the special pot and they go to a graveyard to dig up the body of President John Quincy Adams, hoping that his brain could help them pass the courses or that weirdo who passes out tickets reacts to seeing his bicycle being destroyed. This film is so out there!The acting is actually good and the characters have vibrancy. Also in the film are another great rap group, Cypress Hill, and former NBC alums Anna-Marie Horsford (Amen), Fred Willard (DC Follies), and yes, Lisa from Saved By The Bell (Lark Voorhies).The DVD contains a lot of stuff, from the usual documentaries, music videos, commentary, etc to neat things like the "Hide The Stash" game where you have to find Meth and Red's pot by clicking on the correct 420 and there's even a preview of Eminem's "8 Mile" film. All in all, a lot of fun; if you're like me in my mind frame, see it. This film might be a cult rental like Showgirls and The Doors are for me.</p>
