<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I guess they butchered the book to keep the movie within 2 hours.  The book has subtleties and plots that make this an INTERESTING chronicle of life in the 20th century for a typical upper class white male.  This movie is not interesting.  This features a good cast -- Newman and Woodward and Patrick O'Neal.  Newman takes the harder path to success, wins the girl of his dreams (Woodward) and should live happily ever after.  For some reason he falls head over heels with a girl 20 years his junior and his wife decides at the same time to return to college boyfriend O'Neal.  The movie somehow manages to make Woodward look like a tramp and Newman like a long-suffering man.  In reality they are both cheating.  So I guess hollywood couldn't admit that there was a guaranteed network of prep school and clubs for the white protestant male.  They had to rewrite the book to make it appear like Newman struggled.  Then the entire WW2 sequence so important to the plot of the book is skipped which means we have a happy ending instead of a man who ends up a pathetic loser.</p>
