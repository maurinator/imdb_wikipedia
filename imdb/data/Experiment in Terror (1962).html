<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Glenn Ford is an FBI agent; Lee Remick is the victim of someone she's never seen in "Experiment in Terror," directed by Blake Edwards and also starring Stefanie Powers and Ned Glass. Remick is very effective as a plucky bank teller who's approached from behind and told to steal money from the bank where she works. The only thing she can tell the FBI is that it's a man who has heavy, asthmatic breathing.Ross Martin plays the criminal. He's a thief and murderer; he also is in love with a Chinese woman and is paying for her son's operation. Her terrorizes Remick and her sister (Powers). Martin really died too soon. He was a wonderful actor, and this was a great role for him.Glenn Ford is a dream FBI agent, and why do I think there are no FBI agents like this? He's gentle, kind, and concerned, not to mention handsome. He has a nice chemistry with Remick.There are some great scenes in "Experiment in Terror." One of the best takes place in the apartment of a woman who makes mannequins; and several take place right at the beginning, when Martin accosts Remick and later surprises her in her home. The scene in which he kidnaps Stefanie Powers is downright scary. Powers is unbelievably young here, but she was a good actress even then and gives a convincing performance.The big scene takes place in Candlestick Park which several posters have written about. Not having their expertise, I won't.I really love the atmosphere Blake Edwards created in this film, and I love the casting of Ford, Remick, Martin, and Powers. This is a fine film, definitely worth a watch if you want to see how good movies are made. Suggested rather than shown violence, no special effects, black and white - yet it still works.</p>
