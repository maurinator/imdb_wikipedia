<h1>Seventeen Again (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cat and Gene have been divorced for several years. They are both visiting their son and their grandchildren, Sydney and Willie. Willie's a genius who develops a formula that makes who uses it young again, it inadvertently spills into some soap that Willie places in his grandparents room. When each of them uses it they finds themselves 17 again. Willie had to find a way to reverse the process but will his grandparents want to be old again?</p>
<p>While divorced and bickering grandparents watch their grandchildren, a lab experiment gone awry transforms the elders into teenagers again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A wistful little fantasy where some wrinkled old momma and papa use a magical soap to turn themselves into perfect young teensyboppers to live such giddy fun-filled high school lives just like their kids they envy so much. As if being a teen makes you superior to the rest of the whole humanity or that teens is the only time you can be such a wonderful person and enjoy your life to the fullest. Sheesh. Too bad the kids watching this Disney movie wouldn't have any magic to save them from the horrid inevitability of turning into their own wrinkled old parents!</p>
