<h1>Best Friends (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a professional couple who have lived & worked together for many years finally decide to marry, their sudden betrothal causes many unexpectedly funny and awkward difficulties. They soon find that being married is often quite different from being "best friends."</p>
<p>Richard Babson and Paula McCullen are successful Hollywood screenwriting partners, best friends, roommates and lovers. They decide to take the next step in their relationship by buying a house together. Because of the symbolism of the house purchase, Richard is able to convince an initially reluctant Paula to get married, her reluctance due to it meaning that she has to be a grown-up in life, just one of her many neuroses. In agreeing to get married, Paula in turn is able to convince Richard to take a cross-country train trip first to visit her parents in Buffalo, New York for a week to help celebrate their fortieth anniversary, then to Vienna, Virginia to visit his parents for a few days, Paula and Richard who have yet to meet their respective in-laws. Beyond the pressures they face from their producer Larry Weisman concerning their latest screenplay, Richard and Paula may not be able to survive not only as a married couple but as a partnership in all its aspects on this trip, as each not only can see into the future of their spouse by his/her parents, but the state of marriages in all their facets the longer they progress. The situation is exacerbated by their marriage being placed under a microscope by those around them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't think of ANY movie made before or since, that I've seen that compares to this hysterically funny yet dramatic view of relationships.If you've been married and divorced or lived with someone then married, you have to be able to relate to this movie! It's SOOOOOOOO true to call! I'm ordering this DVD today- but I haven't seen it for 10 years. Yet~ it's one of those movies I always look for ~ and relate to. It's sticks with you!DYNAMIC writing- EXCELLENT Performances. The in-law scenes... Blah... But the basic plot and performances- Sensational!A friend of my daughter (LANA) is an actress and was working with Goldie's son. When Lana called my daughter- All I could yell in the background was for her to GET ME THIS MOVIE!! It's one of a kind!</p>
