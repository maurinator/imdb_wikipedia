<h1>Risky Business (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A suburban Chicago teenager's parents leave on vacation, and he cuts loose. An unauthorised trip in his father's Porsche means a sudden need for lots of money, which he raises in a creative way.</p>
<p>Left alone in the wealthy northern Chicago suburbs with the family house and Porsche at his disposal, Joel, through his scheming friends, finds himself entertaining to-die-for lady-of-the-night Lana. After meeting Joel's enthusiastic friends, Lana spots a business opportunity, and suggests bringing in some of her equally stunning colleagues. Joel is aghast at such an idea, at least until the Porsche accidentally falls into Lake Michigan, requiring a quick infusion of ready cash.</p>
<p>A Chicago teenager is looking for fun at home while his parents are away, but the situation quickly gets out of hand.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tom Cruise stars in this 80's teen flick that was popular for its time and still has a good message to this very day. Tom playing the innocent Joel Goodson, a kid that is on his way to making it big and getting into a good college until he meets up with the call girl Lana(Rebecca De Mornay). This movie just goes to show you how certain decisions can have different impacts on how the overall picture turns out, and Joel sees and realizes just that. The show was cast perfectly and the music adds to spice the movie up. This is a Warner Bros. classic and I think anyone in their right mind should see it.</p>
