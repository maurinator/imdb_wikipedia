<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At first I thought that this was just a vehicle for a Hallmark talking plush that responds to voice cues. But I ended up watching the half hour special on the hallmark channel and was very impressed. The Claymation short was very well done and quite mesmerizing! A very heart warming story of the puppy and of course there is a happy ending, and all ends well. You can read the synopses and that covers the story line. Owning the interactive plush would be very special for a kid(or anyone else) :) There are 2 storybooks available for purchase, and jingle responds to the TV as well. It's probably one of my favorites I have seen in a while..</p>
