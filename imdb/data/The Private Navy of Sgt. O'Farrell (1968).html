<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I own this movie and I really did not think that it would be all that great. But I was pleasantly surprised.  It's GREAT and Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller work great together.  I highly recommend it.  I love the two of them together.  I have to say that I consider Bob Hope to be in the top 10 of funniest comedians.</p>
