<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1961 Long Island Alice is just that bit younger than her playmates. She doesn't quite understand yet about some grownup things and is teased a lot. Her heroine is anyway Sheryl, the teenager over the road who has a succession of boyfriends. Alice even copies her perfume and favourite records, though she has never spoken to her. When Sheryl's father dies suddenly and she takes up with Rick, who is viewed with horror by all the parents around, she and Alice become firm friends as they try to keep the romance going.</p>
<p>Alice, a ten-year-old girl, has a crush on the 17-year-old wild girl across the street. She leads a three-person cheering section as the teenager, named Sheryl, falls in love and has forbidden liaisons with a young man from the bowling alley. Eventually, Alice becomes instrumental, in spite of her parents' alarm, in helping the two lovers to resolve the difficulties of their relationship and run away together. In the process Alice herself becomes more mature.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoy this movie two of my favorite actors are in this movie and a very young not yet known Eliza Dushku makes her debut in this movie. I have to say I was very impress with her acting in this film. As always C. Thomas Howell to me gives a great performance and no matter what movie she plays in I watch. Juliette Lewis is one of the most underrated actress I think to date. She always make it seems like the script was written for her. As always I am never disappointed in her performance. To whom of those whom read the book One Summer Night I think you would fine the screen version to your liking. If you are into oldies but goodies then this movie is for you it takes you back to your teenage rebel years in the 50s' and if you weren't born in the 50s' it make you wish you were coming up in that era.</p>
