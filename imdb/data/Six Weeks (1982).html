<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first time I saw this movie I was probably 6 years old. I never forgot it. Actually, this is the very first movie I can remember seeing on television, probably because I spent the next hours crying my eyes out.I remember the couch was blue, and the little girl on the screen who was having so much fun dancing in the metro fell and didnt come up.Seven years later, I saw it again. It was on TV, I caught a glimpse of the little girl's face and I knew it was it. It had not changed a bit and I cried my eyes out once again. Even before the ending.</p>
