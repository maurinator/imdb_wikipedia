<h1>Not Another Teen Movie (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At John Hughes High School, the students are the same as just about every other teenager in a teen movie. The popular jock, Jake, takes a bet from Austin, the cocky blonde guy, that he can transform Janey, the pretty ugly girl, into the prom queen before the prom. But two people are trying to stop Jake from succeeding: his evil sister, Catherine, the cruelest girl in school, and Priscilla, the bitchy cheerleader. And all of their friends are the same as any other teen movie: Areola, the naked foreign exchange student, Les, the beautiful weirdo, Malik, the token black guy, the desperate virgins, Amanda Becker, the perfect girl, Ricky, Janey's obsessed best friend, and Sadie, the VERY old undercover reporter.</p>
<p>After breaking up with his girlfriend, Priscilla, a popular jock, Jake Wyler makes a bet with his friends, that he can't make 'ugly girl' Janey Briggs into prom queen. After spending more and more time with Janey, Jake really starts to think whether he wants to keep the bet on or not.</p>
<p>A sendup of all the teen movies that have accumulated in the past two decades.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you watch Scary Movie (which parodies... yeah.. scary movies!) the movie is pretty hilarious if you can recognize all the scenes. In Not Another Teen Movie they make fun of... you guessed it; teen movies! The only movie I've seen, that they make fun of, is Bring It On, but even though, this movie is hilarious! Yeah, sure, most of the humor is, what I like to call: "Pee, poo and fart humor"... or down in the gutter humor if you'd like, but it works!This movie is definitely worth watching! Especially in the company of others so you can laugh each other up.WATCH IT!</p>
