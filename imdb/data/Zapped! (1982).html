<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just bought a copy of Zapped for $5 and watched it for the first time in several years the other day.  All the reviews you will read for the movie here sum it up.  It's a bad story, with bad actors, with bad acting, with bad special effects and I enjoy it every time I watch it.  I don't know why because I've never liked Scott Baio or Willie Aames in anything else they did, but they click here.  I also think Felice Schacter was a cutie in the picture.  I always make the comparison to WKRP in Cincinnati when I watch this picture.  Felice is Bailey Quarters and Heather Thomas is Loni Anderson's Jennifer (and I preferred Bailey by far).  I always got a kick out of Scatman Crothers and he has some great lines in this movie as does LaWanda Page (from Sanford and Son fame).  And don't forget the movie industry's biggest geek, Eddie Deezen, who makes an appearance.As another reviewer put it, watching Zapped is a guilty pleasure.  if that's the case, I probably belong on Death Row!  If you want to clear your mind of all thoughts and don't want to do it with chemicals, pop in Zapped and enjoy!</p>
