<h1>For Singles Only (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anne and Helen move into a California apartment complex for single only where all the occupants are looking to hook up with Milton Berle as the building manager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of those B-movies that flooded drive-ins when I was a kid.  This one's about an apartment building where the manager (Milton Berle) only rents to singles.  It plays like a trashy soap opera, with the characters involved in different story lines.  John Saxon is always nice to look at, however.</p>
