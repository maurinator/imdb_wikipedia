<h1>Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ten women, most of them in Vancouver or Toronto, talk about being lesbian in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: discovering the pulp fiction of the day about women in love, their own first affairs, the pain of breaking up, frequenting gay bars, facing police raids, men's responses, and the etiquette of butch and femme roles. Interspersed among the interviews and archival footage are four dramatized chapters from a pulp novel, "Forbidden Love": Laura leaves her hick town and heads for the city, where she meets Mitch in a bar. Sparks fly, and so do laughter and joy. Ann Bannon, one of the writers of those paperback novels about forbidden love, talks about the genre.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you have any interest whatsoever in lesbian lives as they really have been and still are lived this is THE documentary to see. No doubt that we have to salute those women who "dared" to show their faces on screen in this documentary; it's not anything we are used to at least not outside the North America.Even though the woman portraited are, of course, living in North America it is still a fabulous documentary, actually quite breathtaking in all its "naturalness".Also spiced with a bit of "filmic erotica" I feel is it a necessity to watch for any lesbian woman.Bravo to those who came up with the idea and bravo for the woman who dared all along!</p>
