<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was possibly the best Biography that A&E ever did. It was also the first comprehensive and correct visual biography about Judy to ever be compiled and aired on T.V. It contained rare clips, photo, performances, and interviews never-before-seen. Now, due to a change in copyrights for much of the material, the special cannot be aired. Judy Garland was one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived, and her real life contained more drama than most of her movies. Much has been written about her over the years, much of it inflammatory, embellished, sensationalized, and just flat out untrue. I remember watching the A&E special when it first aired in 1997, the night before the Academy Awards. I was completely floored and astonished. It was never released on DVD, and now it probably never will be. Anyone who has not had the opportunity to see this absolutely incredible biography will now never get the chance, which is a terrible shame.</p>
