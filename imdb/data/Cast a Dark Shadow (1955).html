<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A clever fortune-hunter with a penchant for murder does in his elderly, supposedly rich, wife and manages to get away with it. After an investigation results in a decision of 'accidental death', our crafty killer discovers that his late wife's 'fortune' is not what he thought it was. Driven to find another unsuspecting spouse; he discovers that his new bride, a widow, is no fool. When she tells him that she intends to keep her accounts separate from his, he is driven to contemplate murder once again.</p>
<p>After one year of marriage, fortune hunter Edward Bare - who is affectionately referred to as Teddy (as in "teddy bear") by his older, wealthy wife, Monica - manages to kill her, making it look like an accidental death on her part, which it is eventually ruled as by the coroner. He killed her now as he recently had a discussion with her convincing her not to write a will making him her sole beneficiary which she intended to do - as such casting any possible aspersion away from him as a murderer - under the presumption that she had no will, which would mean that her entire estate would go to him regardless. Edward is dismayed to learn that Moni did have a will written immediately after they got married, leaving all her money to her Jamaica-residing sister, Dora, who she had not seen in twenty years, but leaving him the house in which they live. Despite the will also stating that Moni's money would revert to him on the event of Dora's death, Edward has no means to be able to kill her. Moni's lawyer, Phillip Mortimer, makes it clear to Edward that he has never trusted him and believes he is responsible for Moni's death. Within this context, Edward has no money now on which to live, making him move to his next victim, brash Freda Jeffries, who he meets at a seaside resort. Nouveau riche widowed Freda gained her wealth through the sale of her deceased husband's business, a saloon. Following Edward and Freda's marriage, he finds that Freda is not nearly as trusting of him with her money as Moni was with hers, Freda treating her money as her own, as such making Edward's task of living high off Freda's wealth more difficult. Freda's non-trust is due in part to Edward spending time with a woman named Charlotte Young, who Edward, through his previous work as a property broker, is helping find some property to open an equestrian school. Edward knows that he can't kill Freda, at least not yet, because the death of two wives in such close succession would cause suspicion. However, Edward has no idea how profound an affect Charlotte will have on his life with Freda based on a secret Charlotte is keeping.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I tuned into this movie not realizing I had seen it years earlier, so I didn't pay a lot of attention to the opening credits or the set up. I was soon hooked - all over again. This is a thoroughly engaging movie with a twisted plot line. A thrilling English mystery with a wink and a nod.Dirk Bogarde plays an absolute cad with a caviar appetite and a beer purse. He marries a tattered old English matron for her money, but misses the mark when she fails to include him in her will. They do a scene at a seaside tea house that is not to be missed. Listen for the lilting melody of the all girl band. He needs another sugar mama before his money runs out, and heads back to the tea house for another try. For a dapper dude, he really does not know how to pick them. This time his target is a shop worn widow played to the nines by Margaret Lockwood.It took me until halfway through the second viewing to figure out she was the same actress that played the naive ing√©nue in Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes". Not only does she outguess him, she outfoxes him. About this time, I began to think he ought to get another line of work. Margaret Lockwood makes him look like an amateur. Instead of her being a rich, vulnerable pigeon, she turns out to be very savvy slut who one ups him at every turn.There is a real mind bender ending, but I would never screw the reader by revealing it. Every time I thought I had this movie figured, I got hit with one surprise after another until about four minutes before the ending credits rolled. Give this movie a play, but only if you have the time to give it the attention it deserves. For me, most of the delicious moments are quite subtle. I gave this movie a 9/10 and I'm a stingy voter.</p>
