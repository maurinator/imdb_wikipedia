<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dr Who and the Daleks is a good little film. It is fairly typical of the British Sci-Fi movies made at this time. The plot is ok, but where the movie succeeds is with the acting and set pieces. Peter Cushing makes an excellently dotty Doctor, Roy Castle is bumbling as Ian Chesterton and Roberta Tovey does well as a young Susan. The action scenes set on Skaro are fantastic and quite chilling, and the set designs, costumes and Dalek design are all frst rate. What is a sin is that the Television theme tune is discarded for a more bouncy swinging sixties type, and the TARDIS interior is abolished for what looks like a gatecrashed science lab. The Doctor is referred to as 'Dr Who' throughout the movie and the whole thing is slightly camp. If these thing would have been ironed out this could have gone on to be come an all time classic. On a final note it is also a shame William Hartnell didn't play the Doctor in the movie, that would have been fantastic, but Peter Cushing is more than good as his replacement.</p>
