<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A new music teacher in a 1955 West Texas home for wayward boys brings new vision and hope for many of the interned boys.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rock n' Roll has been associated with sin ever since the white man stole the sound from African-American musicians.And while the music teacher in this drama isn't intent on co-opting black culture, he is intent on using the up-beat arrangements to inspire his students.On the lam from police, harmonica-player Jack (John Travolta) holes up in an all-boys school, where he lands a gig teaching marching progressions.A rebel-at-heart, however, Jack tutors his students (James Walters, Scott Coffey, Glenn Quinn) on a new rhythm that's sweeping the nation.Meanwhile, the pious principal (Richard Jordan) is displeased with Jack's teaching of the devil's music as well as one student's intentions towards his daughter (Heather Graham).A cheesy teen revolt against the puritanical beliefs that plague a small-town, Shout is as seditious as it is silly.Besides, playing Rock n' Roll won't conjure up demons until you play it backwards.
