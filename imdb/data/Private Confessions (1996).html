<h1>Private Confessions (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Five conversations frame a flawed marriage in this film written by Ingmar Bergman about his parents. Guilt-ridden wife Anna (Pernilla August) divulges an extramarital affair to a priest, her uncle Jacob (Max von Sydow). He presses her to confess her sins to her husband, Henrik. As the film moves back and forth in time, the notion of truth is tested. Tomas, the lover, and Henrik will find that Anna's confessions do not absolve anyone, and have the power to inflict more pain.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great acting all the way down the cast list. It's easy to get involved and empathize with the heroine, to care about her and what she's going through. And that, for me, is what makes a movie great.Great photography, too.</p>
