<h1>Full Body Massage (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nina, a successful but world-weary art dealer, is surprised to find that her usual masseur, Douglas, has sent a substitute - Fitch - to provide her with her regular weekly massage at her home. Nina and Fitch find that they are both mutually attracted, and annoy one another a great deal. Their differences of temperament and lifestyle create friction, and they find their similarities nearly as grating. Through flashbacks we learn how Nina and Fitch have arrived at this meeting, and see that perhaps they have enough common ground to learn some important lessons from each other.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nick Roeg always provides an interesting film dealing with the loss or rejection of our primitive instincts. In this very contemporary scenario we witness the interaction of a woman art dealer and an unexpected replacement masseur. Art, idealistically, is the essence of our culture, and touch (massage) is a basic communication of truth, yet in the end we find that both these people have been stranded alone by their past failures. We are perhaps witnessing the beginning of a romance. Not so much thought-provoking as it is believable (if you've ever been addicted to massage).</p>
