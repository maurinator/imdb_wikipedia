<h1>Mike's Murder (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Betty has a crush on her tennis coach Mike. He keeps on promising to call, but never does - she doesn't know that he's a little dealer. After a failed deal in someone else's district he has to disappear for three months. He contacts Betty again, but she waits in vain - he's killed before they meet. Now she tries to find out what happened, asks around among his friends. This leads her right into the drug scenery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is compelling because the character of Betty is so innocent about what is going on in this murky tennis coach. It makes it easy to see how a normal person could find themselves in way over their heads without knowing it. The kitchen scene with the pal of Mike's who manages to get away from the bad guys is gut wrenching. Debra Winger has never gotten the breaks that she richly is due. I feel that it is compelling that the late Bette Davis stated that of the new actresses that Ms Winger was the most like her and I don't think that she was merely referring to their bad press.</p>
