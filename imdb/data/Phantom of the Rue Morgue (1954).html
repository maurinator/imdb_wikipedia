<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 19th century Paris, a series of gruesome murders baffles the police. In each case a woman is found beaten to death inside a locked room. Suspicion soon falls on innocent Professor Pierre Dupin (Steve Forrest). Maybe somebody should look at his colleague Dr. Marais (Karl Malden), who has a caged gorilla and bad luck with the ladies.Warner Bros. horror-thriller, originally released in 3D. It's essentially a color remake of the 1932 Murders in the Rue Morgue, but with more ties to Poe than Universal bothered to have. Despite improving in some areas, it's not as good overall. Roy Del Ruth's direction is flat and Karl Malden can't match Lugosi's manic performance in that earlier film. Also, Lugosi's Dr. Mirakle had a far more interesting motivation than Malden's Dr. Marais. But the lack of chimpanzee close-ups and Steve Forrest making a better hero than Leon Ames are both pluses in favor of this over the 1932 film. Comparisons aside, this is a nice time-passer that you'll probably enjoy. Anthony Caruso is creepy as Malden's one-eyed henchman. It's not scary (it doesn't really try to be) but it is entertaining. Look for Merv Griffin in a tiny role as a college student.</p>
