<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"I Still Know" picks up a year after the original ends. Julie James is still suffering nightmares from her being stalked and almost killed by Ben Willis, the fisherman with the hook who had been run over by her and her 3 friends a year earlier. Her best friend Karla wins a trip to the Bahamas and soon after they arrive Ben Willis returns to finish what he started.This movie is the pits. The acting is bad, there is NO plot, Willis kills several people for absolutely no apparent reason very graphically, he also isn't scary in that slicker and hat, especially since he revealed himself in "I Know", almost everything in the film is predictable: the murders, the "scares", the storm knocking out the phones and the lights, etc. The ending is also ripped off from another highly popular horror film. This movie could be considered one of the WORST horror films ever made. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack.</p>
