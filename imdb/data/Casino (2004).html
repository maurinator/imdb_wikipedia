<h1>Casino (2004)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mark Burnett scored a hit with the Apprentice, but in that show we began to see elements that he would soon use much more in his other projects: scripted drama and actors planted in (Such as Omarossa). We saw even MORE of this, and more scripting and reenactments in his failure The Restaurant (2nd season especially). At least the viewers reacted and the show was just plain dropped from the NBC schedule. Now he brings us "The Casino", on FOX. Maybe Burnett's trying to get some revenge on Fox by sending them a huge dud. This show is awful. Full of actors and scripted drama. It's all fake. All of it. And not even good actors. It's just so obvious, that it is insulting to watch. On top of that, the drama isn't even interesting. At least cover some of the business side or something. Overall -2/10. Yes negative because it's doing harm to all television, and harm to the reality genre.Hopefully this string of failures will cause Burnett's garbage to drop off the map of network television.</p>
