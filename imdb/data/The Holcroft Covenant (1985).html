<h1>The Holcroft Covenant (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Noel Holcroft is a foreign-born American citizen working in New York as an architect. In Geneva he meets with a respected Swiss banker who tells him he has been designated to be executor of a huge 4 1/2 billion dollar trust fund designed to make reparations for the war crimes of the Nazis. Holcroft's father, who committed suicide in 1945, was a key Hitler financial advisor who became conscience-stricken about German war atrocities, turned against the Fuehrer, and covertly diverted Nazi funds to a secret Swiss account. Under the terms of the covenant Holcroft must locate the sons of his father's two associates so they can jointly activate their fathers' account. They battle the sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent them from signing the document as it is believed that it will be used to establish a Fourth Reich.</p>
<p>In 1945 the children of the third reich were secretly hidden all over the world to be concealed until the 1970s, when they would come of age. Then the most elaborate plans and $780 million in a Swiss bank would be waiting. There would even be an unsuspecting outsider to set the plan into action. That outsider is Noel Holcroft, the American son of a high-ranking nazi. He's just been shown an amazing document, "The Holcroft Covenant." If he signs, it will be his own death warrant and a devastating threat to the security of the world.</p>
<p>A man who was a confidant of Adolf Hitler dies and leaves a fortune to make amends for his Nazi past--but his son has to search the world to find it.</p>
<p>The son of a German General becomes part of a mysterious conspiracy to gain hidden Nazi funds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This muddled movie offers another insight into what happens when rather good film makers overstay their talents.The well known director, writers, and actors, all disappoint in a film that's terrible from start to finish. When a feature offers up the names of several writers (known for far better work) you could be forgiven for assuming that one of them, has been brought in to attempt to fix the mess of another - and here, it shows painfully. For a film from the mid eighties, it has the look of something made a decade earlier.Michael Cain playing Michael Cain, at times looks as if he's not sure if he is working on the right set (or understands the script). Other main leads are equally unconvincing. The only notable performance comes from the always reliable Lilli Palmer, who's simply wasted in her role as Cains mother. In one sequence the terrible script (and director) has her hysterically crying about her poor 'shop window' after a car has plowed into it...leaving several innocent by-standers lying tragically 'crushed to death ' in front of her! James Cann, did himself a huge favor when he walked out on this one.A marginally interesting original idea lurches from one unbelievable situation to the next within an unintentionally laughable screenplay adaptation. For those who don't want to take its serious plot seriously, it might pass with a push, but it'll be a big push. Sorry, but not this time. Local telecaster Gem Australia, who often run marvellous vintage classics put this to air as a very blotchy telecine transfer (as they unfortunately often do with some of their classics). It's poor when a HD Digital channel uses sub standard transfers. Looks like they just don't care. KenR.</p>
