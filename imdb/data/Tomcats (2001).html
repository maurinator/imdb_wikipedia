<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Seven years ago, a bunch of friends make a bet that'll give the last remaining bachelor a ton of money. Now, after losing a ton of money at a Vegas Casino, Michael Delaney has to quickly get his friend Kyle married so that he can collect the prize money to pay back his debt.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those rare gems  a truly funny film.Jerry O'Connell (`Sliders') is a hapless bachelor who's made a bet with his college buddies that the last one to get married will win the stake, which, after 7 years, has grown to almost half a million dollars. When he accidentally loses $50,000 at a Vegas casino and has one month to pay up or kiss goodbye to his anatomy, he decides to use dirty tricks to get his last rival married, in order to pocket the prize for himself.The film is fast-paced with a hilarious series of mishaps, a brief comic salute to Cruise's cliff-top stunt in `Mission Impossible 2' and a new twist to the `boyfriend stops the wedding ceremony' gag. You'll remember this film whenever your girlfriend or wife asks you to `say the three little words' ("I love you" or ?) and you'll think twice about eating in a hospital canteen again.If you liked Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds and the Naked Gun, you'll love this. If Deuce Bigalow or Ace Ventura got you to smile, this one'll guarantee a belly-laugh.My three little words  rent it now!</p>
