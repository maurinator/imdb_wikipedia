<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found a restored copy of this film on VHS over at the local Salvation Army Thrift store in Hagerstown, Maryland which I bought for a dollar. The restored portion was the Pam Grier nude scenes with Bruce Dern. I had seen the cut version of this film before and enjoyed it. Pam's bit was a bonus. This is a nice film on running and the Dipsea Race in and around Mill Valley and Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County near San Francisco. It is about a runner who is now in his 40's and had been banned from running competitively because he tried to organize the runners of his day to admit using cashed in airline tickets to support their being able to run in the sport and compete . . . his father Flash was a union organizer and bit of a leftist as was his mother. The film revolves around his family relationship with his widower father and his preparation and running of the race despite not being able to "officially" be entered to run. Nice to see Bruce Dern playing something besides a bad guy or fool. This is a good film to watch as was his Silent Running.</p>
