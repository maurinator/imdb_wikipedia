<h1>Branded to Kill (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The number-three-ranked hit-man, with a fetish for sniffing boiling rice, fumbles his latest job, which puts him into conflict with a mysterious woman whose death wish inspires her to surround herself with dead butterflies and dead birds. Worse danger comes from his own treacherous wife and finally with the number-one-ranked hit-man, known only as a phantom to those who fear his unseen presence.</p>
<p>The film's story centers on Hanada, a.k.a. "No. 3 Killer," the third-best hit man in Japanese organized crime. Near the top of his game, his fortunes change when he encounters Misako, a mysterious, death-obsessed woman who brings him a particularly difficult mission. In a famous moment indicative of the film's eccentric sensibility, a butterfly lands on his gun's sight at the exact moment he pulls the trigger, causing him to miss the shot. This failure means that the killer becomes the target, and must run for his life from his former employers, and the mysterious "No. 1 Killer." While the film does contain some spectacular action sequences, the story is played less as a suspense thriller than as a surrealistic, psychosexual nightmare, filled with grotesque imagery and strange touches, from Hanada's fetish for the smell of boiling rice, to Misako's use of a dead bird's corpse as a rear-view mirror decoration.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Seijun Suzuki refers to his films as "entertainment" and without critical merit.  Yet, this was somewhat tongue in cheek as he stated that critics feel a movie must have a "moral or some social commentary" to be worthy of attention.  Be that as it may, "Branded to Kill" is simply a fantastic achievement.  Suzuki was working with both a lead man and a script provided to him by the Nikkatsu Corporation.  As such, when you evaluate his films, you do so by focusing on the technical merits.  Personally, I find his disconnected editing, and surreal lighting styles to be amazing.  Suzuki's skill turns what is otherwise a laughable boiler plate film noir into something more.  The lighting and editing make the exclamations that the script doesn't, and the decision to shoot the final scene in a boxing ring is brilliant.It was entertaining to watch person after person jump up and down about the originality of "Ghost Dog" with no mention of the fact that Jarmusch lifted one of the assassination sequences unchanged from "Branded to Kill".  Hopefully as more of Suzuki's work comes to DVD, people and critics alike will recognize a blatant tribute when it is given.  Suzuki deserves them all.</p>
