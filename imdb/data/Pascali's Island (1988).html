<h1>Pascali's Island (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>1908: Pascali, a spy for the Sultan, sends reports to Istanbul that nobody reads. His suspicions are roused when a British archeologist appears, who may not be quite what he seems.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautifully acted, wonderfully realized, full of sensual details & the sort of behavioral, moral, political, historical nuances you'll never ever find in american films. Gorgeous to view & review again & again.</p>
