<h1>Babes in Bagdad (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hassan, the Kadi of Bagdad, has a harem housing twelve beauties, but concentrates his attention on Zohara. A newcomer, Kyra, introduces rebellion into the by the unheard of act of complaining to the Caliph about the lot of the women in the harem. Hassan suffers a greater shock when his God-son, Ezar, asserts that women are the equal of men. They make a wager under which Ezar must settle down with a conventional harem unless Zohara can outwit Hassan within ten days.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Put Paulette Goddard and Gypsy Rose Lee together and you gotta admit that sparks will fly. Although Miss Lee is more suitable for this kind of high jinx, Miss Goddard does hold her own. Add John Boles as the Hassan and his son, played by Richard Ney (Mrs. Miniver) with Sebastian Cabot in a smaller role and look for Christopher Lee as a slave seller. I thought this was a riot. All the actors seem to play with tongue in cheek, which is Miss Lee's forte. Now mind you, John Boles, Stella Dallas fame and Richard Ney are distinguished actors. But here they let loose and along with Miss Goddard have a romp. Fun all the way through. And Paulette and Gupsy Rose make lovely Harem ladies.</p>
