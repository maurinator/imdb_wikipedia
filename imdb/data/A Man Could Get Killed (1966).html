<h1>A Man Could Get Killed (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An American businessman who is mistaken by everybody for a super-secret British agent on the trail of smuggled diamonds. When supposedly his liaison at the British Embassy meets him at the Lisbon airport, the car intended for him is blown up. No matter how much he protests, all of which are accepted as cover for his actual mission, he is then transported into a world of scheming, dangerous, underworld characters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just wanted to let anyone who might stumble upon this movie to know that it's certainly worth your time viewing.  Melina Mercouri is great as the widow of a shadowy underworld figure who entangles James Garner in her search for missing booty.  The booty being a small fortune in loose diamonds.  The movie has lots of sixties style going for it and is set in beautiful Mediterranean locales.  With a great supporting cast of sixties superstars like Sandra Dee and Tony Franciosa the movie entertains with tons of tounge in cheek, cloak and dagger sexy verve. It's a fun in the sun movie with all the stars putting in great performances.  One final note, as the credits roll at the end of the movie, Frank Sinatra's rendition of Strangers in the Night provides a fitting and satisfying end.</p>
