<h1>No Mercy (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Maverick Chicago cop Eddie Jillette poses as a hit man to meet with someone in from New Orleans looking to have a job done. The result is that both the guy and Jillette's partner wind up very dead, while a stunning blonde in on the setup disappears. He heads south to settle the score and soon finds himself being hunted, with the girl in tow and the local police anything but happy. New Orleans may never be the same again.</p>
<p>Eddie Jillette and Joey Collins are partnered Chicago detectives working largely undercover. While on a drug stakeout, they learn of a contracted hit to take place in New Orleans, the actual target unknown. The contracted hit becomes personal for Eddie who travels to New Orleans to investigate. His primary lead is the wealthy southern Deveneux family, Paul Deveneux who was going to contract the hit but got killed supposedly by his intended target in Chicago. When the Deveneuxs prove uncooperative, Eddie turns to his only other lead, a blonde named Michel Duval who was Paul's companion in Chicago. While Eddie is able to track down Michel, NOPD learn that Eddie is town, they who make him unwelcomed in the city. But worse, Deveneux's intended target, a man named Losado, also knows Eddie is in town and he and his henchmen know who he is. This begins a game of cat and mouse between Eddie and Losado, with Michel caught in the middle, often as the pawn and often as the bargaining chip, as Eddie learns largely from Michel the connection between Deveneux, Losado and her, and as Eddie and Michel seem to be falling for each other.</p>
<p>Eddie, a Chicago cop on the edge, goes undercover as hitman. A man and a mysterious woman want him to kill a merciless New Orleans criminal kingpin. The sting goes sour and Eddie's partner is killed. All Eddie wants now is revenge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 1986, when No Mercy was released, two names that would be near the top of any "World's Sexiest Man" and "World's Sexiest Woman" lists would have been Richard Gere and Kim Basinger. In getting these two gorgeous people together, the makers of No Mercy then committed the age-old sin - they forgot to provide them with a decent story! Gere plays Chicago cop Eddie Jillette. Whilst on a case, Eddie's partner Joe (Gary Basaraba) is brutally murdered by French gangster Losado (Jereon Krabbe). Jillette heads down to Losado's New Orleans lair to avenge his partner's death. There, he meets gangster's moll Michel (Kim Basinger), a stunning woman desperate to get away from her sadistic lover but too afraid to do so. She and Jillette end up handcuffed together, hiding out in the dangerous Louisiana swampland from Losado and his heavies. Immediately, you can see that No Mercy is riddled with stale plot devices - cop avenging the death of his friend; hero stealing a lover from the villain; usual fish-out-of-water ideas (this time a Chicago cop working in New Orleans); even the swamp sequence has a whiff of The Defiant Ones and The 39 Steps about it. The film is also excessively grim and nasty, with Krabbe in particular struggling to do anything as a one-dimensional, knife-wielding sadist. The action high-spots, including a climactic shootout in a burning hotel, are quite expensive-looking sequences but, like the rest of the film, are oddly uninteresting and unoriginal.</p>
