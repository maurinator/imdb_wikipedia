<h1>Nunzio (1978)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nunzio is a rarely aired film concerning a twenty something mentaly challenged man. On the surface he appears to be a loon wearing a towel as a cape playing hero. Fortunately for the viewer he turns out to be much more. David Proval in an understated performance shows us the life and first time love in a wonderful fashion. In the end we see a wannabe hero that truly can be. A small film not to be missed.</p>
