<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I believe that this movie will help revamp the film industry into a more positive world. I absolutely loved this movie! It is definitely for the whole family. I encourage all to see this movie if it is playing anywhere. It is definitely worth your while and will be enjoyed thoroughly by all. What is special about this movie is that there is no foul language, no violence, no inappropriate scenes, yet the entire family loves it. From the newborn to the teenager, your kids will most certainly enjoy seeing this film. It is very funny and entertaining! If you are an Italian, you will cherish this film even more! Although the majority of the film is in English, there are a few Italian lines here and there! So if you have the chance to see this movie, please, please, please do! Also, this is to the owner of this film or anyone associated with this film: if you could please please get this movie into theaters or at least on DVD many of us would love it! It received rave reviews from all whom saw it!There was a big ovation at the end from all who attended! No doubt there will be many people buying this if it does come out!</p>
