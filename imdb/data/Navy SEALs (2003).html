<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Socom II features a superb story in where you eliminate a drug lord and his operations. The single player is strong and challenging but it is best used as a practice run towards the online multiplayer matches. Online fighting is intense, sharp and precise. If you are shot in the head or chest maximum or near near fatal damage will occur. Whereas if shot in the leg or arm you will receive less damage. The gameplay is spot on and the easy to use online interface is a blast. Now you can locate where your friends are playing online and can join them for a match. Score 10/10.</p>
