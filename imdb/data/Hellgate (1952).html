<h1>Hellgate (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man is accused of spying for the confedaracy, and sentenced to the notorious Hellgate Prison. After he unsuccessfully attempts to breakout, and is sentenced to solitary confinement, he redeems himself when the prison is taken down by a plague.</p>
<p>A lesson in visual deja vu for those who had seen John Ford's 1936 "The Prisoner of Shark Island", indicating that director Charles Marquis Warren and producer John C. Champion, as co-writers of this film, had some working knowledge of the Ford film themselves. The prison in the one, called Hellgate, is set in New Mexico during the Civil War, where the sadistic warden, Union Army officer Tod Vorhees (Ward Bond) takes more than an instant dislike for newly-arrived prisoner Gil Hanley (Sterling Hayden.) Hanley is innocent of the crimes charged to him---shades of Dr. Samuel Mudd---but that doesn't cut him any slack. Those who saw the Ford film know an epidemic is about to hit the prison and Hanley will be called on to combat it. Those who didn't can be surprised when it happens.</p>
<p>Man is framed & sent to toughest prison in the territory.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the best films to come out of the Poverty Row Lippert Pictures Studio was this hard nosed and brutal western drama Hellgate. The title is named after a prison on the New Mexico desert where Sterling Hayden is sentenced to some hard time.A number of reviewers have already commented that the plot is taken straight from the story of Dr. Samuel Mudd. Hayden is a former Confederate soldier who has settled in a Union area of the west and just wants to forget the war. Hayden and wife Joan Leslie give some assistance to an injured man, Hayden is a veterinarian and therefore has some medical training. The man turns out to be a former Quantrill guerrilla and the locals are quick to believe Hayden has to be one also. He gets sentenced to Hellgate where he comes under the tender care of commander Ward Bond and Sergeant Major Robert J. Wilkie.Though the plot may come from The Prisoner Of Shark Island, the jail is like the one Sessue Hayakawa ran in The Bridge On The River Kwai. It's set in a desert canyon with no water, it has to be transported in every month. The jails are underground carved right in the rock crevices. Like Hayakawa, Bond has no guards the desert does discourage most escapes. He does however have Pima Indians who can track escapees and get more for bringing them dead than alive.If you know the story of Samuel Mudd from The Prisoner Of Shark Island you know what happens here in Hellgate. Sterling Hayden really dominates this film, especially when he vies for supremacy in his particular cell with James Arness, a pretty hard case himself. This is one of Hayden's best acted roles and ought to command some of the same attention given to The Asphalt Jungle and The Killing.Don't miss this one if it is broadcast, especially for fans of Sterling Hayden.</p>
