<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How can you watch a movie with Thora Birch and not just want to eat her up for being so cute. I am not referring to the lovely Thora in American Beauty, but the really cute one in this film.She just wants Santa to get her parents back together. Her brother Ethan (Ethan Embry) doesn't believe in Santa, so he tries to help make his sister's wish come true with the help of the lovely Amy Oberer.Now, I don't know what mom (Harley Jane Kozak) sees in Kevin Nealon, when her ex is Jamey Sheridan (Syriana, "Law & Order: Criminal Intent"), so he must have screwed up big time.Anyway, Ethan comes through and all is well. Or, was it Santa (Leslie Nielsen)?</p>
