<h2> Summaries </h2>

They can't seem to find the next big thing and they have to deal with another agency who's not above bribery to get the kids to sign with them. One day Michael meets a girl named Angie and she's a real spitfire. Michael thinks she could what they are looking for. Problem is that she has a big chip on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Michael J. Fox stars as a child actor who has grown up, and grown out of his popularity. He now runs a talent agency with his brother, specializing in child acts, trying to discover the next child star. He gets more than he bargained for when he recruits a child pickpocket to be his next "star."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Michael J. Fox plays Michael Chapman, who once upon a time was a wise-cracking child star on a situation comedy called "Life With Mikey." Now in his thirties and on the skids, Michael makes personal appearances at grand openings of hamburger stands, and runs an unsuccessful talent agency that specializes in kids with his brother Ed (Nathan Lane). The agency's only successful client is Barry Corman (the great Jewish actor, David Krumholtz), a 14 year old with an attitude who is known as "the cereal king" for his appearances on television commercials. Ed is trying to talk Michael into closing the agency and Barry is threatening to go elsewhere when a sprightly 10 year old reprobate named Angie (Christina Vidal) tries to pick his pocket. When Angie delivers a heart rendering tale of questionable honesty about being an orphan from Queens, Michael realizes that Angie would be perfect for a Sunburst Cookie commercial. She clicks in the commercial, and both her career and the agency's soar. In the meantime, Angie movies in with Michael, and as they bond, Michael realizes how to act like an adult and Angie realizes how to act like a child. I liked Life With Mikey, I know its nothing new as a plot, but still funny with the great Fox and entertaining Lane heading the cast.</p>
