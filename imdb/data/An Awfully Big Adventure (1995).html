<h1>An Awfully Big Adventure (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set right after World War II, a naive teenage girl joins a shabby theatre troupe in Liverpool. During a winter production of Peter Pan, the play quickly turns into a dark metaphor for youth as she becomes drawn into a web of sexual politics and intrigue.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I particulary enjoyed this film.  I thought Hugh Grant did a great and decidedly out-of-turn portrayal of the deviant Meredith.  Alan Rickman looked so cool on that motorcycle it wasn't even funny.  The lighting in this film was excellent, and it's portrayal of petty theatre politics was pretty accurate even by modern standards.  Georgina Cates was a wonderful Stella and the plot was well-developed.  It seems as though most English adaptations of books tend to be better cinematically than original American films.  Go figure.</p>
