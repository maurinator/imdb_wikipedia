<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Home Alone is arguably one of the funniest movies ever! Its really good. The cast is very good! It was sweet to see John Candy in it! The team work of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern is just not insanely hilarious but its also incredible that the two are so good together and I like how their scenes of punishment is followed right after the other! I think John Heard looks like Bruce Willis! I like Catherine O'Hara, she is a fine actress! Look for Larry Hankin and Roberts Blossom! John Williams has another great score here!This is a perfect movie for people to watch around Christmas and if you need a big laugh watch this as it will crack you up! Also, I strongly recommend Home Alone 2! It arguably funnier then this plus Time Curry, Brenda Fricker, and Rod Sell appears in it! Both movies are strongly recommended!</p>
