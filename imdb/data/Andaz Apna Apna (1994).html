<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Andaaz Apna Apna is the most comic movie of the decade.You can't stop laughing during the movie.Right from the first scene to the last, your giggles don't stop.Amir Khan is brilliant.His comic timing is superb.His dialogue delivery, gestures,uninhibited style all compel you to laugh like hell.Salman Khan is good.Paresh Rawal is his usual best.The dialogues by Rajkumar Santoshi are good(Amir Khan mouthing Purush-Mahapurush).The music reminds you of good old times.The scenes where both the characters Amar Prem try to outwit each other,they try to woo Raveena and the fighting scenes in the Climax are really funny.It is very difficult to decide which is the most comic scene.All of them are on top of other.Definitely one of the best feathers in RajKumar Santoshi's Cap. I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genre of Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies).</p>
