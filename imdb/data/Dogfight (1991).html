<h1>Dogfight (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1963, the night before the 18 years old "Birdlace" Eddie and his friends are shipped to Vietnam. They play a dirty game called 'Dogfight': all of them seek a woman for a party, and who finds the most ugly one, wins a prize. Eddie finds the lonesome pacifist Rose working in a coffee shop. She's happy to accompany him - but then she sees through the game. However by this time he already learned to like her, so he follows her home. Will he manage to win her heart despite their differences?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you were to pick out one River Phoenix film from his cannon of films, to show to someone unfamiliar to his movies, this would be it. It is quite simply a wonderful performance. Although this received an almost non existant cinema release, the magic of this movie will continue for future generations through word of mouth, as I have found, when people discover it, they just want to go out and tell people to watch it! The ending is perfect and says so much more than a thousand words ever could.</p>
