<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another enjoyably hearty Burt Reynolds vehicle to the long-winded comedy caper list, but making it more a welcoming ride is a strong cast along side him with David Niven, Lesley-Ann Down and Patrick Magee. Director Don Siegel serviceably lets it flow without much structure, as the crafty story has its twists and turns with its clever fa√ßade before finally revealing its trump cards. An aging Scotland Yard detective Chief Insp. Cyril Willis is coming towards retirement, but before calling it a day he has plans of capturing Jack Rhodes an American jewel thief that throughout his career has always been one step ahead. So in comes a beautiful lady, which is part of the plan to nab his man. But what blossoms is unexpected.Tailored like an old-fashioned romance comedy, "Rough Cut" is all about a laconically lounging Reynolds sweeping the gorgeous Lesley Ann-Down off her feet, while finding some time to organise a quick in and out heist of some diamonds. Sometimes the tone can be jumpy, but everything feels like its on cruise-control with Siegel's automatic handling, especially when it comes to the excitement and dangers of the job. The witty script is where the rapid fire comes from. However the action when it arrives is masterfully shot. It's smooth and magnetic, just like the performances. The interplay between the cast works. Reynolds plays it dry and confident. A sexy Down is a complete delight and Niven only adds to the wilily fun.</p>
