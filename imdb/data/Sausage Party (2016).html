<h1>Sausage Party (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The products at Shopwell's Grocery Store are made to believe a code that helps them live happy lives until it's time for them to leave the comfort of the supermarket and head for the great beyond. However, after a botched trip to the great beyond leaves one sausage named Frank and his companion Bun stranded, Frank goes to great lengths (pun intended) to return to his package and make another trip to the great beyond. But as Frank's journey takes him from one end of the supermarket to the other, Frank's quest to discover the truth about his existence as a sausage turns incredibly dark. Can he expose the truth to the rest of the supermarket and get his fellow products to rebel against their human masters?</p>
<p>Frank is a sausage who has always wanted to be purchased and "go home," but he does not yet know the truth. What he does not know is that his kind is used as a snack and he strives to find the truth of his existence in this cruel food-eating world.</p>
<p>A sausage strives to discover the truth about his existence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What would happen if we could put every nationality, every religion, every race and every political disagreement inside the minds of beers, tomato cans and detergents? Or bagels, tacos and hot sauce? Well, Seth Rogen gave it a try. With the help of the folks who had already brought us Neighbours, and a luxurious voice- over cast, he delivers one of the funniest and most effective comedies of the year. It's too damn much at times, but it feels so good. It's genius the way the writers create every single food personality either based on their shape - take the sausage for instants, it behaves exactly the way you think it does - or their country of origin, and that's the way I liked it best. The bagel that can't stand the lavash, the German beers that oppress the juice (GOT IT?), or the sexy taco who's just too hot to handle (brilliantly voiced by an equally hot Salma Hayek), it's a perfect depiction of the past and current problems of the world, told in a way too harsh and explicit for a live action movie. But what's up with them? Basically, they think that being picked up from the shelf and brought home by the so-called Gods (humans, they mean) is the best thing that can happen to them, leading to another political critique - unproven and irresponsible adoration. It's all false, and Rogen seems to get a little personal on this one, with his character desperately trying to prove that you can't just believe in it because you've heard about it your entire life. The main lesson? Don't let yourself be led to the promised land by unknown gods. Sometimes it's right there for you to reach it. What a gloriously extravagant experience. What a wonderful surprise.</p>
