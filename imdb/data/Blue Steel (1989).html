<h1>Blue Steel (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On her first day on the job, NYPD officer Megan Turner, the lone officer on the scene, shoots and kills the perpetrator of a supermarket hold-up. Since no gun was found on the perpetrator's person or at the scene and none of the witnesses could corroborate Megan's story definitively that the perpetrator was indeed wielding a gun, she is suspended from active duty. She is quickly albeit temporarily reinstated to the position of homicide detective because the spent shell casing from the bullet used in a subsequent murder had her name carved on it. This murder ends up being only the first in a series. Working on the case with fellow homicide detective Nick Mann, Megan initially has no idea who in her life could be the murderer. In short order, the murderer does show himself to her. He is commodities trader Eugene Hunt who she met immediately following her suspension and who she has since dated. He also implies to her that he was in the supermarket at the time of the hold-up and that he fled the scene with the perpetrator's gun. The supermarket shooting caused a psychotic break in him which resulted in among other things his obsession with her. However, beyond his implications only to her of being the murderer, Megan has no hard evidence that would stand up in a court of law that Eugene is indeed the murderer. Megan has to convince her colleagues, especially Nick, that she is telling the truth about Eugene, while stopping him from killing again and equally as important stopping him from his continued psychological torture of her.</p>
<p>A female rookie in the police force engages in a cat and mouse game with a pistol wielding psychopath who becomes obsessed with her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's hard to write Blue Steel completely off the map because of (a) Jamie Lee Curtis, (b) Kathryn Bigelow, and (c) its noiry, metallically inclined cinematography. It's a shame that so much of the film wastes its time traveling through various clich√©s and laughable plot twists as so much of it is truly inspired in its delivery. Megan Turner (Curtis) is a rookie cop who immediately makes a mistake that would make most want to immediately shrivel up and die: She overreacts to a store robbery and shoots the gunman with a gratuitous number of bullets. Megan is suspended. No gun was found at the crime scene.She is assigned to desk work, but after only a few days on the job, her world is rocked. Someone is gunning down innocents, carefully carving her name on the bullet in hopes to frame her. The police chief hesitantly promotes her to detective status so she can investigate, but he, as most other police chiefs in movies do, makes it clear that he is already heavily doubting every word that comes out of her mouth. Megan's professional life may be in the slums, but her personal life, in the meantime, is picking up. She begins dating Eugene Hunt (Ron Hunt), a well-to-do stockbroker. The relationship gets so hot and heavy so quickly that it's almost as if it was made to fit fluidly in the film's 102 minute running time.Eugene, as it turns out, isn't just a stockbroker. On the night Megan fatally confronted the store robber, Eugene was one of the customers confined to the floor. And guess what? He was the one who took the gun from the crime scene. And guess what else? He is the man who is murdering all those helpless civilians. It doesn't take long for Megan to discover just how disturbed her new boyfriend truly is, but no matter how many times she arrests him, he gets away, considering he has a high powered lawyer and her police chief hates her. But when Eugene begins killing people close to Megan, she takes the law into her own hands.The plot is so implausible that it's impossible to take Blue Steel seriously. At its core, it's an above-average B-movie that looks like a luscious art house thriller. If only the substance was as breathtaking as the style. Bigelow, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, has gone on to bigger and better things, now living as an Academy adored filmmaker who has created masterpieces such as The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. Blue Steel is her third film, and it's hard to call it a complete failure. Yes, the story is like a weird, erotically violent cop fantasy, but stylistically, it's certainly strong. Making use of silhouettes, city street smoke, and neon, the night scenes are certainly intoxicating, and the score, while sometimes a little too 1990 for its own good, provides an industrially minded, synthy backdrop that subtly exudes a cyber punk cool.Curtis makes for a fantastic woman in trouble, more relentless than she was in Halloween. Without her, the film would completely collapse. Despite the thousands of issues that come along with the plot, Curtis is consistently enthralling, acting up a storm in her action scenes and fulfilling likability in sequences of dialogue. Silver, however, is the film's weak link and most likely why it fails as hard as frequently as it does. Any actor could have made Eugene Psychopath of 1990, but Silver goes much too far. He's so over-the-top that any hamminess verges on irritability. Just look at the way he shoots people. He somehow gets away with it time and time again, but how does no one in the streets notice the way he dramatically lifts the weapon over his head and brings in down with the slow motion theatrics of Joan Crawford on the move?Blue Steel is a tough one to dislike. It's eye-catching and contains an important performance in Curtis' underrated career, but one can hardly tolerate an annoyingly off-the-rails Silver and a too-stupid-for-its-own- good storyline.</p>
