<h1>Reality Bites (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this study of Generation X manners, Lelaina, the valedictorian of her college class, camcords her friends in a mock documentary of posteducation life. Troy is her best friend, a perpetually unemployed musical slacker. Vickie is a manager at the Gap who worries about the results of an AIDS test, while Sammy has problems grappling with his sexuality. When Lelaina meets Michael, an earnest video executive who takes her homemade video to his MTV-like station, she must decide what she values--the materialism of yuppie Michael or the philosophical musings of Troy.</p>
<p>A documentary filmmaker and her fellow Gen X graduates face life after college, looking for work and love in Houston.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a much better film than the consensus would have it. in fact, I would say it bids fair to become a classic (it certainly will serve cultural historians of the nineties well...) Compared to "Singles", a superficially similar film released a couple of years earlier, "Reality Bites" is so much more, well, biting... Not to say that I don't like Singles, it's cute, but the movie in question here is much more than that. I could really empathize with these characters, especially Rider's Lelaina Pierce. It's hard to hang on to ideals in the real world (guess that's why I'm back at university). The script is REALLY good, almost every line is funny or incisive or both. The acting is first-rate- so they're playing themselves, so what! Does that make it any less enjoyable? I don't think so... This is a superior romantic-comedy, set amongst the same noncomformist set that enlivened the screwball comedies of the thirties, and it works just as well...</p>
