<h1>Dondi (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Six American GIs stationed in Italy befriend an orphaned boy, but the soldiers remain unaware that the lad has stowed away with them when they return to the U.S. The six go their separate ways, leaving the tyke aloin in the big city. Now, New York becomes one big adventure for a little Italian boy named Dondi.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Undoubtedly one of the worst little films ever made. The well-known "shlock" movies have no pretensions, don't take themselves too seriously and at least give the viewer a few laughs. "Dondi" is a true BOMB with no redeeming features which, when originally released, probably went long way to undermine US/Korean relations. As Leonard Maltin suggests, "Watch this film and you will understand why David Janssen became a fugitive!"</p>
