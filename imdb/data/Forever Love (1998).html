<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Forever Love is a poignant new television movie about a woman who awakens from a 20-year-long coma and begins her life all over again. In the drama, suggested by a true story, Lizzie and Alex Brooks are a fairy tale young couple, wildly in love and the parents of a little girl, Emma. Then, without warning, 24-year-old Lizzie suffers a stoke. At the hospital, doctors tell Alex that his young wife has slipped into a deep coma and there is nothing to do but wait to see if she comes out of it. Alex, determined to keep his vow to love Lizzie in sickness and in health, decides to bring her home and take care of her. Alex is helped and consoled by Gail, Lizzie's best friend. Gail not only offers a loving friendship to Alex, she fills in for Lizzie with young Emma as well. When Gail's husband is killed in a car crash, Alex, Gail and Emma form a de facto family unit of their own until, 20 years after her stroke, Lizzie wakes up. Miraculously, Lizzie is pronounced perfectly healthy and begins to try to assimilate back into a world that has radically changed. Emma, who is about to be married, is thrilled to have her mother back, as are Alex and Gail. But, Lizzie's presence is also confusing for all of them as she attempts to move back into the place she rightfully occupies in their lives. It's a journey of challenge and discovery for all of them as they grow, change, and begin to embrace each other again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must take issue with the young girl. This film has struck me deeply, a 47 yo man, as a fine piece of sensitive and well done work. I was impacted positively by many aspects. The key one is the performance of all four main characters. Reba is obviously visually stunning, and works through the emotions very convincingly and poignantly. My wife and I just completed a 4 year victorious battle against cancer on her part...and this movie MOVED me deep inside. Reba is a world class vocalist too! Her husband also wrestled well his role as a flawed and vulnerable man in great pain. The other woman was initially selfless, then flawed, and finally courageous and selfless to get out of the way. The daughter is a developing young actress...and expect she would do well in the future. This film makes me want to follow up other works by these three women.</p>
