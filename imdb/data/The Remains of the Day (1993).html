<h1>The Remains of the Day (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A rule bound head butler's world of manners and decorum in the household he maintains is tested by the arrival of a housekeeper who falls in love with him in post-WWII Britain. The possibility of romance and his master's cultivation of ties with the Nazi cause challenge his carefully maintained veneer of servitude.</p>
<p>Approximately a quarter century in the lives of James Stevens and Sarah Benn n√©e Kenton - called Sally in the most casual of circumstances - is presented. The bulk of their story takes place in the first few years after their meeting in the 1930s when Mr. Stevens, who has worked this entire period as the butler at Darlington Hall in Oxfordshire, hires Miss Kenton as the new housekeeper for Lord Darlington's stable of servants. The story focuses on their relationship as coworker servants, with Mr. Stevens' position as head of the manor servant staff. An epilogue of sorts is also presented in the 1950s after a twenty year separation and a seven year period of non-correspondence where Mr. Stevens, still at Darlington Hall working as butler for its new owner, retired American Congressman Lewis, goes to visit now separated Mrs. Benn where she now lives in Clevedon in the west country to ask her to return to service at Darlington Hall. Congressman Lewis bought the manor following Lord Darlington's death, his life which eventually was mired in scandal regarding his geopolitical work before, during and after the war. That relationship between Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton is dictated largely by Mr. Stevens' priority on what he sees as proper decorum in their work, which results in him largely hiding his emotions from everyone, while Miss Kenton, who still does her job as good as any housekeeper, wants Mr. Stevens to come out from that decorum which may make him an even better butler. As feelings start to develop between the two, that wall of decorum that Mr. Stevens has built may prevent anything from happening, especially fraternization between staff has largely been frowned upon by both of them as a disruption to the household.</p>
<p>A butler who sacrificed body and soul to service in the years leading up to World War II realizes too late how misguided his loyalty was to his lordly employer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ishiguro's story of duty finds career butler Mr Stevens preparing to meet Miss Kenton, once the head maid in his household.  They have not seen each other for 15 years and once had an unspoken love.  As he journeys down to meet her he remembers a lifetime spent in quiet, honourable service.I don't like period pieces.  Merchant-Ivory stuff usually feels very false and stifled to me.  Here I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away from start to finish.  To say the story is about a romance isn't the whole picture, to say it's about British-German politics pre-WW2 is not the full story.  In fact the film is about it all - but the focus is Mr Stevens.  He serves dinner while his father dies in an upstairs room, he puts his own opinions so far back that he doesn't have any, he is so focused on the proper way to serve that he never finds his own life.  To describe in like this makes it sound very dull, and to some people it may be, but trust me - the story is beautifully observed and has so much going on in the background that it'll keep you interested.  The main reason it works is a faultless central performance by Hopkins.Hopkins drives the whole film.  His face and his speech reveal more about his inner feelings than anything else.  It can be frustrating to see him always put on a brave face and bury his emotions, but once you get his character (a man of quiet honour, dignity and respect - any wonder he seems otherworldly by modern standards) it's fine.  He is fantastic - I cannot say it enough.  His lot in life is moving, but what is incredibly moving is that he seems content to let his life slide by.  The scene where Thompson's Miss Kenton confronts him about the book he is quietly reading is beautiful, truly beautiful - revealing their closeness and the depth of Stevens' heart.  Thompson is also excellent in her role but doesn't have as much screen time as Hopkins.  Fox, Reeves and Chaplin are all excellent in their roles.If the film has a weakness it is that it doesn't judge the rich - even the Nazi sympathisers.  It almost seems to revere the elite - I know they are not the focus but Merchant-Ivory always seems to be obsessed with how the other half live (or maybe they are part of the other half!).  The ending is also a little disappointing because it's quite low-key, but it's very, very touching.Overall this is excellent - I didn't think it would be that good, but it totally blew me away.  Sit down and let this story unfold before you, let the characters develop and ensnare you.  I guarantee you will be deeply moved by Hopkins.  The rather crude message of `seize the day' is beautifully told in a rich tapestry of one man's life.</p>
