<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just finished watching this delightful movie about a five-year old Iranian girl who is given money to buy a goldfish but loses it. The film, innocent yet interesting and enthralling takes the viewer along on her journey to find the money so that she can get her fish. She encounters many people along the way, all who try to help her to get back the money. There are many underlying themes throughout the movie as well, but above all, we learn to help each other and see each other as more than just strangers. Also, the plot summary given about this film is misleading and downright false. No one tries to take advantage of this little girl at all!</p>
