<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Story of the world-renowned trumpet player.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Arturo Sandoval is one of the most phenomenal trumpet players the world has in existence today. The story of his love, his passion, and his music are all colorfully depicted in the film. As a musician and jazz connoisseur myself, I feel that Garcia's portrayal of the anguish Sandoval experienced under Castro's regime is excellent. As he reveals his motives for defection to the American ambassador, there is a sense of unspoken understanding as to the reasons that Sandoval decides to defect.If you walk away from this movie without any emotion, you just didn't get it. Go out and listen to as much jazz as possible!</p>
