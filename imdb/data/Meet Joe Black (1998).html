<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this movie was quite clearly spectacular. I mean, from the trailer it looked like some teen, low-production-cost flick that I'd stay as far away as possible, but in truth, the movie was deep, meaningful and left you thinking about it for ages and ages afterward.The actors were brilliant. I thought Brad Pitt, against a lot of people's expectations, performed very convincingly, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, stunned me and transported me. Claire Forlani was the only main actress who suffered slightly but still pulled off a reasonable performance. I personally thought the Jamaican Woman, played by Lois Kelly-Miller was very touching, and the conversations between most of the characters were all interesting and well, some of the advice you could put into use in your own daily lives.The story line is edgy and dwells on sensitive subjects such as Death, Love and Happiness, I suppose. The wisdom behind it is unmistakable. I think this movie is underrated. Despite the disappointing Trailer, the movie will blow you away. I watched it on VCD, something that has low-ish quality on a computer, yet I managed to sit through all 170 minutes, completely stunned and unable to budge from concentration.Overall, this movie is definitely recommended. A bit deep for your kids, I guess- I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.I'm giving it a 10/10 for it being emotional and funny at times. Overall a serious movie, and one that will truly make you think. It is quite complex and will definitely leave some strings untied, but I guess a bit of room for imagination never hurt anyone.</p>
