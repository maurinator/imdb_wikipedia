<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is a small, understated comedy great director John Ford which is a personal vision and critical of the military bureaucracy and war and patriotic atmosphere in USA during WWII. Its jocular tone of light comedy in patriotic look is the main obstacle to appreciate this amazing work of Ford that much more serious and hard displayed in your message what the viewer expects. Of note is the clever staging of Ford, the great rhythm of the film and the great performance of Dan Dailey, a regular player in Ford's films rarely got an interpretation of importance to show what a great player he was.During a fertile period of great westerns, John Ford also focused on war films, from a distance with dramatic comedy of manners, so this tape is relegated to a lower division in the vast career of Ford. A nice manners, hilarious comedy and schematic, determined to show the softer side of the war five years of perspective from its end, In the film lays a steely critique of supreme folly, with an apparent simplicity some military commanders shown directing the troops so awkward, as if Ford charged any debt with the military bureaucracy. It also mocks the stupid desire for heroism as assertiveness and social and family recognition in a small town. It is this sub-genre in USA called "Small-Town Comedy." Few directors as John Ford are able to gather in a movie as mixed messages as harsh criticism against the stupid patriotism and military bureaucracy (even in times of war), and the friendly and harmless comedy.Again the script serves the master of cinema and description of characters and "gags" comedians (great scenes with the dog and the taxi driver) show evidence of a great movie. Ultimately Ford works little known, but remarkable.</p>
