<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film for the first time probably in 1957, and I remember thinking it was very good. I saw it yesterday and was enthusiastic, what an excellent film! I can understand the comment that states that it is the best western ever made, it is certainly among the best. Borden Chase wrote the screenplay and considering he also did Winchester 73 plus the other Anthony Mann's- James Stewart westerns plus Red River, no need to say more. John Sturges was at his best in the fifties (Black Rock, OK Corral, Fort Bravo) and no more proof of that than "Backlash". The story can be described as a "whodunnit" and no more said about that not to spoil the film. The love relationship between Widmark and Donna Reed is well built, and the scene where Donna takes of her shirt to help the wounded Widmark is very, very sexy. William Campbell is OK, but I thought he was better in "Man Without a Star". There are many action scenes, one at the beginning that reminded me of one at the end of "Winchester 73". Also a couple of showdowns. If you already made your "10 best westerns" list, see this one, and you may have to change it.</p>
