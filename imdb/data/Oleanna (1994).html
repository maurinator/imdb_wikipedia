<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is one of my Favorites and Very Underrated.I love movies that challenge my beliefs and shake me up, get me thinking, show me false hoods of my thinking.  Mament' Oleana met this criteria and then some.At least 3 times while watching this I wanted to turn it off!  I felt disturbed, insulted and manipulated!  I stuck with it and the voluminous 1:1 dialogue between John (the professor) and Carol (the student).I watched with my wife and we had diametrically different opinions about the issue of sexual assault.  This discussion with my wife was very enlightening for me; I could not believe what was coming out of her mouth.  My wife was so vehemently committed to her position (that Carol was a victim of sexual assault) I started to laugh!  (Tip for the fellows: never laugh at your wife in these moments!)After another 2 hours of discussion I moved my opinion to the `middle ground'.  All in all this was the most thought provoking and `shake up my atrophied beliefs' movie ever.Highly recommended when you watch that you do so with someone else of the opposite sex!  Very intriguing discussion afterwards!</p>
