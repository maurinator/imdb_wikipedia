<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The year was 1969 and everything was groovy.  Even Disney released "The Love Bug" which became the biggest domestic hit of that year.  Squashed into uniplexes somewhere between "The Love Bug" and "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" kids were treated to a quiet little bit of Americana called "Rascal." About as Disney as you can get, "Rascal" is the story about a boy and his raccoon. We've seen it before and after, a boy domesticates a wild animal, animal causes mischief, neighbors blame for every mishap in the area, and by the end of the film the boy must release the animal back into the wild.  No computer generated whales, talking pigs, or alien visitors, just the Disney crew doing what they did best.  Disney has made a ton of these and they work.  "Rascal" is one of the best.  Considering the Sterling North classic novel is still popular and in print I wonder why it hasn't been released on video and/or remade.  At the time of this writing odds of seeing this film at all are very rare and that is a shame considering the inferior product being released direct-to-video for kids today.  Considering the Disney label it would seem this would be ripe for a release on video.  Add to that the cult following of star Bill Mumy ("Lost in Space," "Babylon 5") and you have a winner.</p>
