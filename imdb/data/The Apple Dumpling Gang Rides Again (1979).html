<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this was one of the funnyest movies I have seen..  This almost surpasses Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run 2..  It's a must see..  Tim Conway was as funny as he has been in some of his other movies like the Dwarf..  But I thought Don Kotts took the cake..  I have watched it twice and after writing this I am going to watch it again..</p>
