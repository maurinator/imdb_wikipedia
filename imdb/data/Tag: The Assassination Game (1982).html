<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, all one really needs to say is "This is a film about college kids shooting each other with rubber tipped dart guns." If you are looking into a movie with that premise for anything other than breezy entertainment, you need to raise your standards.That being said, this is a pretty good film. Linda Hamilton, as another commenter said, was really honing her craft here, and many of the skills that she demonstrated in Terminator were beginning to be displayed. Her simultaneous edginess and softness with occasional sultry looks are well worth a view. Carradine is passable as a lead as a wannabe "front page", but like all the Carradines, not very memorable.Finally, it is worth noting that Michael Winslow has some enjoyable scenes as a TAG contestant who entertains himself and others with his very commendable skills as a sound effects specialist. He would eventually go on to great fame in the Police Academy movies 2 years later.Not much in the way of technical expertise displayed here by Nick Castle, who played the Shape in Halloween (though he probably had no budget to work with). Most enjoyable for me was the boom mike that appeared in a classroom scene above Linda Hamilton's head. This however was his first directing role, and it had moments of greatness in it that showed his potential.</p>
