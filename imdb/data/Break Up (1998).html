<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jimmy is married to the abusive Frank, but she's building a nest egg so she can leave. For a year, she's been deaf as a result of one of his beatings. One night, he pushes her over the stairwell, and she ends up in the hospital. When a charred body in her husband's car is pulled from a pond, the cops want to talk to her, but she bolts for her sister's, loses her savings pass-book, and then learns someone has emptied her bank account. She's goes on the run, with the same cops on her trail, and eventually realizes Frank may not be dead. Getting back her money, facing Frank, satisfying the police, and finding her freedom may be more than she can handle.</p>

Actors include Bridget Fonda, Kiefer Sutherland, Hart Bochner, Steven Weber, Penelope Ann Miller, Tippi Hedren, Leslie Stefanson, Mike Hagerly, Tom Harrison, CharlesNoland, Muse Watson, Martt O'Toole, Abraham Venduzco, Anna Getty, Zack Tiegen, Gina Aponte, Tommy Townsend, Robin Thomas Grossman, Susan Barnes, Joe Spano, Jack Shearer, Cynthia Geary, Hal Landon Jr., Srah DeVincertis, Alan Schwartz, Alan Schwartz, Robert Peters and Brent Briscoe. The story is about a couple with severe anger issues. Anger management may have helped, but it would also help the audience which had to sit through the wife beating scenes in this less that perfect film. I was able to only give it 2 stars.
