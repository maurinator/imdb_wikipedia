<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having worn the Habit, having gone through similar personal struggles and worked with inner city poverty and issues, I can attest to the accuracy of this movie.  Also based on my own experiences, Elvis is also quite believable as the young inner city doctor trying to connect with his patients.  It does accurately reflect the turbulence and changes of the 60s, besides being a fun movie.  I identified with it, and feel that people who make fun of it don't really deeply understand the issues it's dealing with. I would especially recommend it to those who would like to understand that period better, plus the personal struggles of the inner city.</p>
