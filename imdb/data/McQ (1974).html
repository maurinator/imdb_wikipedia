<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Critics and viewers often dismiss McQ (1974) as a lame Dirty Harry/Bullitt rip-off (which it is), but the film is redeemed by its utterly unintentional ridiculousness. Think of it as a modern day film noir with shady characters, as the plot involves the "Anti Hippie Radical" Seattle Police Department covertly stealing and selling narcotics for profit. A bloated and bored John Wayne goes through the motions as a former cop who is willing to do anything -- and I mean anything to crack the case, including: *Beating random people up *Doing cocaine with and then having sex with an overweight fifty-five year old homely woman solely for information "on the streets." *Stealing and later brandishing an unregistered MAC10 (which was cutting edge firearm technology at the time.) *Terrorizing innocent laundry truck drivers all over Seattle *Generally acting and driving like a major menace to public safety Other highlights include: *T.C. from Magnum PI as a pimp, "Huggy Bear" type character *The bass-heavy "wah guitar" infused funk score blasting loudly through much of the film *Put some foam on it! I'm up to my butt in gas! Think of this film as a parody (in fact I was laughing so hard I was literally crying) and you'll be golden. 7/10 for McQ (1974)</p>
