<h1>White Mischief (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A millionaire past his prime and his young wife arrive in Kenya circa 1940 to find that the other affluent British expatriates are living large as the homefront gears up for war. They are busy swapping partners, doing drugs, and attending lavish parties and horse races. She begins a torrid affair with one of the bon vivants, and her husband finds out and confronts them. The husband and wife decide to break up peacefully, but the bon vivant is murdered and all the evidence points to the husband.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I'm in a particularly waspish mood I enjoy watching Michael Radford's odd film 'White Mischief'.  I'm not certain how historically accurate it is, though the characters are real enough.  It is beautifully filmed, well-acted, especially by Joss Acklund, Sarah Miles and Trevor Howard, in what must have been his last role from the looks of him.  But what always disappoints me about this movie is that awful sound-track.  What on earth possessed the production team to use that horrible electronic keyboard "orchestra" in lieu of real musicians playing real instruments?  This ruins the film for me everytime and keeps me from giving it a higher score. However, if you are fond of Greta Schacchi, who is absolutely gorgeous here and Charles Dance, ditto, and you have a certain frisson when you see the Indian Ocean from the beach at Mombasa, then see this film.</p>
