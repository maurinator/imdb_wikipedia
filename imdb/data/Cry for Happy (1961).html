<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a durn shame that the actual filming locations aren't listed here, as of July 2008. A title card at the beginning wants us to believe that this was filmed at the US Naval base in Japan in 1951 right after WW II, but for starters, we know this was filmed in 1960/1961. All the inside shots could be filmed on a set. The picture starts at a geisha performance, with the show and the girls being explained to the navy and to the viewer. Sailors led by Murray Prince (O'Connor) are assigned to help CPO Cyphers (Glenn Ford) for a military press project. Sharp viewers will recognize Joe Flynn as John McIntosh, rep for the U.S. press. He will be the Captain in McHale's Navy in 1962. Watch for Ted Knight (from Mary Tyler Moore) as Glick, the Admiral's assistant. Also, Miyoshi Umeki, one of the geisha girls, will be the housekeeper in Courtship of Eddie's Father in 1969. At a press corp meeting, the marines confront the navy, and the lies and mixups begin. While a little dated now, the exotic Japanese kimonos and house decorations, authentic or not, must have made for an interesting film at the time. Similar to "Walk Don't Run" which Cary Grant would make in 1966. Some clever bits about a spaghetti western done Japanese style. Keep an eye out for Harriet MacGibbon, the Admiral's wife - she was Mrs. Drysdale in Beverly Hillbillies. At 110 minutes, this goes on pretty long, but its an entertaining film.</p>
