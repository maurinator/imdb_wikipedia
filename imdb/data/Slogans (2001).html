<h1>Slogans (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Andre starts as a teacher in a remote mountain village in Albania. His first task is to choose one of two communist slogans. He picks the shorter one, which is appreciated by his class, because they have to build the slogan on the hillside using whitewashed rocks. However, this means that the longer slogan goes to Diana, the French teacher to whom Andre is attracted. Andre gets on the wrong side of the communist party boss of the village, when he stands up for an unjustly accused goat herdsman, whom he had befriended. The boss is determined to take his revenge on Andre.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wonderful picture of socialist Albania written in a discreet, almost ascetic way. The novel by Ylljet Alicka "Parullat" (Slogans) was a little changed and included in a story devoted especially for Western cinemas (f.e. the sketch of a popular judge - not real and far from the Albanian realities). The main value of the film is the picture of mentality enslaved people. The slogans, like in the title are the occasion for the expressing of the dictator's cult. Director made this film only with the experienced actors, without new faces. Their roles are very static but it is a specific for this film. The dialogs, carries by the main actors (especially during the funeral) are based on the old rules, the principles of Kanun - the Albanian customary law. The portraits of High Albania very unique in the post 1990 movies, but in many corners of this country it is still a reality - it is not necessary to create something artificial. Ona of the rare cases in which Albanian film could be known wider than in the homeland country. And also it is a good way to understand what really was Albanian communism and how deeply was written in human souls.</p>
