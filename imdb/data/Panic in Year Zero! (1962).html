<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A family struggles to survive the anarchy in a world devastated by nuclear war.  This is a believable story by the standards of the time it was produced;  the possibility of a nuclear winter had not yet been considered. There are no bands of mutants roaming around eating the survivors, just ordinary criminal types.  Yes, I'm afraid that circumstances like that do bring such people out of the woodworks.  Ray Milland's character makes intelligent, and sometimes hard, decisions to ensure his family's survival.</p>
