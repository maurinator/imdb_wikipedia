<h1>Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Get out your white socks! This time our suave college heroes hit the road for fun and fraternity in Florida. Another opportunity for brains to triumph over brawn. How can the girls possibly resist their geeky charms?</p>
<p>The rising college nerds set out to a convention in Florida, but are not welcomed by the Alpha Beta representatives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Tri-Lambs of Adams College goes to the United Fraternity Conference in Fort Lauderdale. Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine), Dudley Booger Dawson (Curtis Armstrong), Lamar Latrelle (Larry B. Scott), Arnold Poindexter (Timothy Busfield), and Harold Wormser (Andrew Cassese) find that they are picked on once again. Gilbert Lowell (Anthony Edwards) has a broken leg and has to stay home. Sunny Carstairs (Courtney Thorne-Smith) is the nice hotel clerk. Ogre (Donald Gibb) follows the guys down to Florida. The acting manager Buzz Mussinger (Ed Lauter) cancels the nerds' reservation and they are left with a rundown hotel. Roger (Bradley Whitford) is the new douche leader.There are some missing nerds. Anthony Edwards was probably busy and could only be in a cameo. It would also have been great to have the girls back. Some lost is to be expected but the movie starts off at a lower level. Bradley Whitford isn't jock enough to be their nemesis. Again I wish Ted McGinley would come back to take revenge. As for the nerds, it's strange to have them be confident. It's not as funny. The charm of the original is that they discovered their individual powers. This one has none of the charm and lost the comedy to boot.</p>
