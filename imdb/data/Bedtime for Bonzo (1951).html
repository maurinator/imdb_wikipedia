<h1>Bedtime for Bonzo (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Professor Peter Boyd's engagement to the Dean's daughter is upset by the revelation that his father was a habitual convict. To prove the Dean's genetic theory of inherited traits as wrong, Boyd starts a 'secret' experiment. He borrows the science department's chimpanzee with the goal of showing that it is one's environment that affects your reaction to right and wrong.</p>
<p>Prof. Peter Boyd is engaged to brainy dean's daughter Valerie. But the Dean wants the engagement ended when he finds that Peter's father was a crook. To prove that environment is more important than heredity, Peter adopts lab chimp Bonzo and vows to "teach this monkey the difference between right and wrong." He hires young nursemaid Jane Linden to "mother" Bonzo; but will Valerie understand if she finds Jane about the house?</p>
<p>College prof Peter Boyd tries to salvage his professional and personal reputation by using a lab chimp to prove that environment trumps heredity in behavioral development.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Are we a product of our surroundings or are we born the way we are going to be? This issue is the driving force behind this intelligent and thought-provoking film that delves into what other films only think about doing.Okay, now really. If you want a pleasant, family-oriented fun little film, then this is for you. Been made fun of as one of Reagan's bombs, it's not nearly as bad as it might sound.When a university professor is judged for his father's criminal tendencies, he is insulted and proceeds to conduct an experiment with Bonzo, the college lab "mascot" to see if a chimp can be taught right and wrong. Diana Lynn (from Martin & Lewis' "My Friend Irma" and "You're Never Too Young") is perfect as the "nanny" hired to help out with Bonzo. Reagan is engaged to the dean's daughter, but well, you can guess the rest. So, sit back and let Bonzo swing from tree to tree and forget your troubles.</p>
