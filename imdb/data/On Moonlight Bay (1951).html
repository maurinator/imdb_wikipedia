<h1>On Moonlight Bay (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Winfield family moves into a new house in a small town in Indiana. Tomboy Marjorie Winfield begins a romance with William Sherman who lives across the street. Marjorie has to learn how to dance and act like a proper young lady. Unfortunately William Sherman has unconventional ideas for the time (setting is during W.W.I, but the war does not play a major part for most of the movie). His ideas include not believing in marriage or money, which causes friction with Marjorie's father, who is the local bank vice president.</p>
<p>In a small Indiana town in the mid 1910's, the Winfield household - banker father George, his wife Alice, their grown tomboyish daughter Marjorie, their precocious trouble-making son Wesley, and their exasperated housekeeper Stella - have just moved into a larger house in a nicer neighborhood. No one but George is happy about the move, until Marjorie meets their new neighbor, William Sherman, home on a break from his studies at the University of Indiana. The two are immediately attracted to each other, which makes Margie change her focus from baseball to trying to become a proper young woman. Their resulting relationship is despite, or perhaps because of Bill's unconventional thoughts on life, including not believing in the institution of marriage, or believing in the role money plays in society. The road to a happy life between Margie and Bill is not only hindered by distance as Bill returns to school and Margie's attempts to learn feminine things, but also George's dislike of Bill because of their differing beliefs, the stuffy Hubert Wakely also trying to court Margie (he who is George's choice as an appropriate suitor for her), Wesley's continual meddling in his sister's life, and WWI. One of those issues may be overcome when George receives a gift from his Aunt Martha.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just happened across this one Sunday morning on Turner Classic Movies, and I loved it. What a cast: Doris, Gordon, Billy Gray (of "Father Knows Best"), Ellen Corby (Grandma of "The Waltons"), Mary Wicks (from the "Sister Act" movies) and others who made this a total trip down memory lane. I can hardly wait for the second movie, "By the Light of the Silvery Bay" (1953) to come on!</p>
