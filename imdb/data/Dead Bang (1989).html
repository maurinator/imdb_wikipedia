<h1>Dead Bang (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A cop is gunned down on Xmas eve. Jerry Beck, the homicide cop given the job of hunting the killer, investigates some leads which bring him into contact with a group of white supremacy extremists. In addition to the racists, Beck also has to contend with an unhelpful FBI agent.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Being a Don Johnson fan, I liked this film.  It's also got a good director(John Frankenheimer).  Johnson's a Dirty Harry-type cop this time with all the stereotypical trimmings of the role i.e. divorced, drinks, never sees his kids, no personal life etc.  This movie's got action, it's witty, funny, satirical, and it's fact-based but it's not Serpico.  William Forsythe is particularly laughable as an FBI straight-man.</p>
