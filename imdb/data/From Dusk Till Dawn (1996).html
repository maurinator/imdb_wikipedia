<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, I can tell u  one thing this movie is pure fun:the dialogues are great, the acting is terrific(especially Quentin Tarantino) and the special effects are nice.You probably asking WHY THIS MOVIE HAVE 6.6 RATING?? , I think that the reason for this is Quentin Tarantino, when people heard QT IS involved in the production of the movie they thought it has similarity to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, actually, it's very different from those films, and that is something that can show us the greatness of QUENTIN TARANTINO.In the bottom line,I liked this movie and I  recommend it.</p>
