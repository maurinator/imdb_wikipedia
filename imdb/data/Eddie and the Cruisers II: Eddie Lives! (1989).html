<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed "Eddie and the Cruisers" but was surprised to learn that there was a sequel made.  I first saw "Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives" when it was shown on TV a few years ago.  At that time, I tried to buy a copy but was unsuccessful.  Later, I finally located and purchased a VHS copy through 'imdb.com.'This movie held me spellbound right up to the end.  I particularly enjoy movies that have a good, tender story-line and a happy ending and this movie did not disappoint me. The soundtrack was great.</p>
