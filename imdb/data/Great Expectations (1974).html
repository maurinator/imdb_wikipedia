<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this years ago back in 1994. The movie has always stayed with me it holds a special part in my heart. Simon Gipps-Kents beauty just took my breath away. Everything Simon Gipps-Kent says and does turns into gold. This boy should got a award but didn't. What makes Simon Gipps-Kent so bloody great is his facial expressions.He plays Pip, Pip is a poor boy thats had a hard life. His parents died when just a little child. His friends take him to visit Miss Havishem. Miss Havishem is very strange. When Pips firsts see her if asks people "Is she mad"? Miss Havisem lets play with the daughter Estella of course, Miss Havishem encourage Estella. I love the erotic undertones this movie has you wouldn't expect but is has. "You may kiss me if you like" Estella asks Pip indeed kisses her. It is the best kiss I have ever seen in a movie! When Miss Havisham asks Estella if Estella likes Pip Estella makes a cute response. I can't tell you because I can't give to much away. Then Pip grows up and thats the end of the movie. Simon Gipps-Kent died of a drug overdose. RIP</p>
