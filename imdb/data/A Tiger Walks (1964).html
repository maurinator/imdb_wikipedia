<h1>A Tiger Walks (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A tiger escapes from a circus truck as it passes by a small town, and hides itself in the surrounding woods. This throws the town into a panic and everyone wants the animal killed immediately, except for the daughter of the sheriff. She wants to capture the tiger and put it in a zoo, thereby saving the tiger's life. Her determination starts a nationwide campaign among children to raise the money to buy the tiger from the circus, but first, she, her father and an Indian tiger trainer must find the tiger before the National Guard do, who have orders to kill it on sight.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A tiger on the way to a circus escapes in a small town. Certain elements seem ahead of their time, particularly the animal rights message conveyed by the town's children, who want the tiger safely captured and put in a wildlife preserve instead of a tiny circus cage. Another element seemed ahead of its time: showing the governor overriding his better judgment due to the political pressure of his advisors. He's not portrayed as a buffoon, just a typical compromised politician. These shades of gray are more common in modern films, but they seem somewhat prescient for a kids' film from the early '60s. Where the film fails is in its casting. Brian Keith plays the sheriff with a seething anger and gruffness that's totally out of place (in other words, a typical Brian Keith effort - did that man ever give a likeable performance?). A few times I even thought he was about to smack his child. Another case of bad casting is British child actress Pamela Franklin as Keith's daughter. What were they thinking? Her unsuccessful attempt to cover up the accent only seems to mute her performance, making her stiff and unconvincing. Tv fans and trivia buffs may enjoy seeing such familiar faces as Edward Andrews, Arthur Hunnicutt, Doodles Weaver, and Sabu (in his last screen appearance).</p>
