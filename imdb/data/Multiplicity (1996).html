<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is no more about cloning than The Wizard of Oz (1939) staring Judy Garland, is about wizards. "Multiplicity" is a romantic comedy, a fantasy, that lightly explores the source of a very common complaint among married people with children. If you have ever wished that you could be in two places at once, then you should enjoy watching this story of a man who actually gets his wish - and then some. We viewers have become a pampered and sophisticated lot, and I was pleasantly surprised that this film nodded its head in acknowledgment of this reality. The cloning technology in the film is no more believable than are wish granting fairy godmothers, but we all enjoy movies about ghosts, werewolves, monsters, and such, with out their having to be validated, so I tip my hat to director Harold Ramis for instead just dealing with the nuts and bolts of facing the clone, or oneself as it were. There is no super-serious or heavy message like that you would expect from something like the "X" Files. The treatment is light, and we are seated somewhere between a Michael Keaton special and family level comedy. Keaton is no less than superb, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission. The plot is very well contained and runs an appropriately narrow course allowing this master performer to explore not only his craft but also the old adage about "  the best laid plans of mice and men ".  The movie is seeded with straight-men(women) who appear as a matter of course as they do in any working day. They react in a believable way to the excruciating confusion that presents itself at almost every turn. The dialog is intelligent and the humor regularly sarcastic without being the least bit cynical. The lead straight-man in the film is Andie MacDowell, who plays her role as wife and mother with dignity, restraint, and is appropriately and intelligently challenged by what she faces as the plot unwinds. She remains loving and kind, while staying strong enough to allow Keaton to bounce off of her effectively without her being demeaned. There is something for all but the youngest viewers of this film and any love making that occurs is implied and anything approaching "bawdy humor" is short, quickly given, and quite tame.Keaton plays the lead male as well as the clones making this film more than a just simple romantic comedy; it is also a warm and charming gift of appreciation to the memory of the late Peter Sellers. Mister Keaton, my regards for a job well done, and thank you for continuing so well in the footsteps of your mentor.</p>
