<h1>Narc (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An undercover narc dies, the investigation stalls, so the Detroit P.D. brings back Nick Tellis, fired 18-months ago when a stray bullet hits a pregnant woman. Tellis teams with Henry Oak, a friend of the dead narc and an aggressive cop constantly under the scrutiny of internal affairs. They follow leads, informants turn up dead, Nick's wife is unhappy he's back on the street, Henry's protective of the dead cop's wife. Nick reads and re-reads the case file, broods, watches Oak's heavy-handed style, sometimes joining in. The brass want to close out the case, Nick and Henry stay on it, and bits of evidence point them to an auto body shop. What actually happened; will Nick ever know?</p>
<p>When the trail goes cold on a murder investigation of a policeman an undercover narcotics officer is lured back to the force to help solve the case.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It took me ages before I could get around to seing this film, but now that I have, I don't know why..This is a very brutal movie, but a very honest one. In something that in some scenes can almost be described as dogma style, the story is about two cops workings as narcs in the underground. Jason Patric and Ray Liotta are both amazing in thier parts, they both manage to get thier characters out in a way that you actually SEE the persons they portray, instead of "just" the actors playing another role as we sadly see so very often in film these days....they actually ACT!!! Bigtime cudos for these two - I always liked both of them, but this might be the best achievements from them both so far and especially with Ray Liotta, that says a LOT..I recommend this film highly...NOT for children though ;-) 7/10</p>
