<h1>The Core (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Earth's core has stopped spinning. Disasters are appearing all over the world: Birds acting crazy, powerful thunderstorms, 32 people die within seconds of each other when their pacemakers quit working. Dr. Josh Keyes and his crew of five (total members: 6) go down to the center of the Earth to set off a nuclear device to make the Earth's core start spinning again or Mankind will perish.</p>
<p>For reasons unknown, the earth's inner core has stopped rotating, causing the planet's electromagnetic field to rapidly deteriorate. Instantly, life around the globe begins to change dramatically. In Boston, 32 people with pacemakers, all within a 10-block radius, suddenly drop dead. In San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge collapses, sending hundreds of people plunging to their deaths. In London's Trafalgar Square, flocks of pigeons lose their ability to navigate, flying into panicked crowds, slamming into windshields and causing drivers to lose control of their cars. And in Rome, as thousands of tourists watch helplessly, an electrical superstorm reduces the ancient Roman Colosseum to rubble. Scrambling to resolve the crisis, government and military officials call upon geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes and a team of the world's most gifted scientists to travel into the earth's core in a subterranean craft piloted by "terranauts" Major Rebecca "Beck" Childs and Commander Robert Iverson. Their mission: Detonate a nuclear device that will reactivate the core and save the world from sure destruction.</p>
<p>Scientists discover that the Earth's core is about to stop spinning. This will cause tremendous natural disasters, wiping out life as we know it. A team of scientists are recruited in a crash project to send a ship and bomb into the center of the Earth to prevent the catastrophe.</p>
<p>The only way to save Earth from catastrophe is to drill down to the core and set it spinning again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a great movie.  It's not meant to be anything meaningful or useful, it's meant to entertain and it does so perfectly.  There is quite a bit of humor which makes even the most implausible parts worth watching and extremely entertaining.  If you combined the best parts of "Armageddon" (which was wonderful) and the funniest lines from "Evolution" (the one with David Duchovny) you will have this movie.Yes, it's campy. Yes, the science is noteworthy only for being completely impossible, and YES it is a wonderfully funny and entertaining movie. So what are you waiting for, go SEE IT!</p>
