<h1>Daughters of Satan (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>James Robertson buys a painting depicting witches being burned at the stake, one of whom bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife, Chris. Chris, gradually taken over by the personality of the witch in the painting that she resembles, allies herself with two other reincarnated witches to plan James' death, as he proves to be a descendant of the man responsible for the witches' fate.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven year old, pre-Magnum, PI Tom Selleck (Jim Robertson) is an art historian who lives in a spooky house in Manila, The Philippines with young wife, Chris. He finds a painting of three Duarte Coven witches and a dog being burned at the stake circa 1592; Chris is a ringer for witch number two. All of the figures in the painting, (including Nicodemus, the dog) begin to fade; Jim runs to and fro to find answers. Jim beautifully proclaims himself a cat lover when Nicodemus attacks him once too often. When Jim sees another related work (where he is a ringer for the torturer, Sir Diego Roberson, should he be concerned when Chris stops wearing her crucifix?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vic Diaz was so good in The Big Bird Cage that I just had to see him again to see if he was as funny in all his films. He was in 112 films and is considered the jolly evil fat man of Filipino exploitation cinema. It may take a while to track them all down.As a bonus, this is Tom Selleck's (Magnum P.I., Blue Bloods, Jesse Stone series) third film. He even has a mustache then.Jim (Selleck) finds a painting of a witch burning, and the with looks like a dead ringer for his wife Chris (Barra Grant). Suspicious things start occurring. She blurts out the exact date of the burning, and a dog in the painting disappears after she sees it for real. Things just get stranger from there.It's all about revenge for a 16th century crime. Very interesting.</p>
