<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It amazes me that the people who made this film could not see what a mind-numbing, boring turkey they had produced. Actors carefully reciting lines obviously drawn from letters, and thus speaking like nobody ever speaks; long, boring scenes where nothing happens (we do not go to films to see T.J. Jackson in bed with his wife or Joshua Chamberlain lecturing his brother on 19th-Century politically-correct terminology for blacks); endless numbers of soldiers being hit by bullets and falling down...). There is no sense of strategy or how the war is going, no feeling for the ebb and flow of battle, nothing but endless vignettes. Jackson would be better represented by giving some idea of why he is considered a great soldier (the Valley campaign) rather than being shown as primarily a sentimental, but simultaneously bloodthirsty, religious crackpot ("hoist the black flag... kill everyone..."). The film also tried to do too much: Gettysburg also has its very boring parts, but is unified by concentrating on the major stages of one battle. And, IMHO, the General Lee in Gettysburg is a much more real character than the one in G&G (who, however, gets little screen time). This movie deserved to fail, and, though I am in some ways sorry that "Last Full Measure" will therefore not be produced, I am apprehensive what these filmmakers would have done with it. It may be just as well.</p>
