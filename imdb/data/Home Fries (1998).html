<h1>Home Fries (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hamburger joint waitress Sally Jackson is pregnant. When Beatrice, the wife of the father, finds out about his infidelity, she sends her sons from a previous marriage, military pilots Angus and Dorian Montier, to scare the living daylights out of him. Their gunship does such a good job, without hitting him, that he dies from a heart attack. Worrying about radio interference that night, they investigate who might have heard too much within the fairly empty reception perimeter, and soon discover only Sally could, still ignorant about her affair with his step-dad Henry. Dorian takes a job there to be sure, but soon falls for her himself, while mother-obsessed moron Angus would do anything to anyone for her honor...</p>
<p>Pregnant Sally unknowingly falls for the stepson of the deceased father of her baby and has to deal with his homicidal family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The reason this film is rated so poorly is that it had the most misleading preview ever.  It was marketed as a feel-good low-IQ no-surprise white-bread movie that Ronald Reagan would have applauded.  Instead it was a dark and original exercise that is well worth seeing.  It has an audience, but they didn't go.  (I only saw it because one of my filmy friends bugged me until I agreed to give it a chance.)  The people that did go based on the preview were ironically exactly the wrong audience.</p>
