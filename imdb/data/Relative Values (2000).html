<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film, though a remake, is worth watching. It's set in England in the 1950ies where an English lord takes his bride, a famous American actress home to mother Lady Marshwood (great Julie Andrews). The trouble starts when it's discovered, that the maid of the Lady is the sister of the actress and she discovers that the American actress is lying. There's even more trouble when the ex-lover of the actress flies to England to win her back. Sounds confusing? Not at all. It is great fun to watch Julie Andrews and Colin Firth (as her posh nephew) plotting together but always having a smile on their face and pretending that everything is good the way it is. If you liked "The Importance of Being Earnest", this is a film you will very much enjoy. And for all others who want to know where the difference between English and American people is, here you can definitely find it.</p>
