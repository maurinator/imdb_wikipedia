<h1>A New Leaf (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Henry Graham is a man with a problem: he has run through his entire inheritance, and is completely unequipped to provide for himself. His childhood guardian, Uncle Harry (a deliciously mean-spirited James Coco), refuses to give him a dime, and Henry, completely unwilling to exercise the only solution he sees--suicide-- devises a plan with the help of his imaginative butler: he can make money the old-fashioned way--he can marry it. With a temporary loan from Uncle Harry to tide him over, Henry has six weeks to find a bride, marry her, and repay the money, or else he must forfeit all his property to his uncle. With only days remaining, Henry meets clumsy, painfully shy heiress Henrietta Lowell (played by director Elaine May). She's the answer to his prayers--if only Henry can overcome the obstacles placed in his path by Uncle Harry, Henrietta's lawyer, and Henry's own reluctance to wed.</p>
<p>The only life that urbane Henry Graham has known is the lavish one afforded by his vast trust fund. But that fund is not as vast as he thought as although warned by his financial advisor of his overspending, Henry is now broke. He realizes that his friendships are all based on money, he has no job skills, and his only living relative - his guardian, Uncle Harry - detests him so much that he will never give or loan him money. On the advice of his proper mannered manservant Harold, Henry's only option to continue his lavish lifestyle seems to be to get married to a woman of wealth, an abhorrent idea to him if only because of having a clingy woman by his side forever, but not abhorrent enough not to proceed with that as an end goal. With $500,000 in physical assets (such as his car, etc.), Henry is able to convince his uncle to loan him $50,000 to be able to continue the charade of wealth to attract that wealthy bride. Uncle Harry's terms: if that entire amount is not paid in full within six weeks, Henry is to turn over the entire $500,000 in assets. Near the end of the six weeks, Henry meets the only person he has found even remotely suitable: klutzy and socially inept Henrietta Lowell, a doormat of a woman in almost every aspect of her life, that is except her professional work as an academic botanist. Henry hates the thought of Henrietta so much that he alters his plan: he will kill her after they're married. But can Henry convince her in just a few days to marry him, and if so can he get at least $50,000 from her to pay off Uncle Harry? The further question becomes if anything will change in either Henry or Henrietta's life that will make him change his mind about killing her, or staying married to her.</p>
<p>Examines the vapid life of a born to wealth New Yorker. After he spends all of what was left to him, his questing after more (without bothersome labor) changes him. The main agent of change is a phenomenally passive and unassuming Henrietta Lowell.</p>
<p>Playboy Henry Graham squanders his wealth and must seek out a new source to maintain his idle rich lifestyle. The easy alternative to work is to find a rich woman, marry her, and murder her. Klutzy, nerdy Henrietta Lowell is the ideal candidate. But in dealing with his klutzy, nerdy, trusting new wife, a botanist, and her ill-managed estate, Henry unwittingly begins to assume some sense of responsibility, not realizing this while planning to do away with Henrietta on one droll camping trip...</p>
<p>Henry Graham lives the life of a playboy. When his lawyer tells him one day that his lifestyle has consumed all his funds, he needs an idea to avoid climbing down the social ladder. So he intends to marry a rich woman and - murder her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film stands up as one of the most sophisticated and heartfelt comedies ever put to celluloid.  Watch it alongside "Hobson's Choice", "Hail The Conquering Hero", "The Apartment", "Shop Around The Corner", "Father Goose", "Trouble In Paradise", and "Love Streams".  Although not a romance, "The Ladykillers" is a black comedy with a similar tone.  See if "A New Leaf" doesn't hold up to these consensus classics.Romance always involves the conflict between selfish vanity and naive devotion or love.Most romantic comedies simply give up the fight at the end, and collapse into gooey, deluded sentimentality (e.g. "French Kiss", "Roxanne").  Some err in the opposite way, concluding on a bittersweet ambivalent implication that love is always dulled or compromised (e.g. "Nothing In Common", "Chasing Amy", "Purple Rose Of Cairo").The acid test of a romantic comedy screenplay is its balance, its resolution of this issue.  Can the lovers truly satisfy each other, without either one abusing or sacrificing his unique character, his intellect, his humanity?The more starkly and intelligently these forces are presented and opposed, the more difficult the problem.   Imagine, then, the most selfish, vain, sarcastic and sophisticated man imaginable, meeting and marrying (for her money) an utterly naive, pure, awkward, cloistered academic woman; a botanist.Fans of irony enjoy silly dated romances for the stereotypes, the gratuitous sloppy honeyed sentiment, the emotional denial.  "A New Leaf" does not shrink from the harsh side of the world, from the dark human character, and (except for the music) it has not dated an hour since its release.The score may be slightly dated, mixed too high in places, but the music is sweet uptown Manhattan violin-muzak, reminiscent of "Theme From A Summer Place", so why quibble?Henry Graham marries Henrietta Lowell intending to kill her.  He is too bad to be true.  Yet, his venal motives are only an exaggeration of our own. He doesn't want to be married; he wants to be free!  He doesn't want to share, he wants everything for himself!  He has never needed people to like him. Only now, he is desperate for money.Henrietta, Henry's opposite, is foremost a botanist.  She is a pure academic, uninitiated in the ways of sophistication, deception, vanity or power, despite her wealth.  Her mind is unprejudiced, but intensely isolated, focused.  She lives in a rarefied climate.  Her dream in life is to discover and catalog a new species of plant, a "new leaf", which would cause her name to be modestly memorialized in the scientific literature.These two opposites must combine in everyone.  It is the problem of romance, most precisely stated.  We love.  We trust.  Yet, we have infantile desires and vanities.  We must struggle in a corrupt world that doesn't give a damn about our delicate preoccupations, to wrest from it the admiration and pleasure our dark hearts desire.  We are Henry, we are Henrietta.  Can these characters love each other?  Can we accept, integrate ourselves?"A New Leaf" rollicks with endlessly clever, sarcastic, inventive, trenchant dialog, reels through convoluted and finely wrought complications, revels in every character, each played by a brilliant comedian.  Matthau was born to play this archetype of morbid, deranged, malevolent and dissolute urbanity. Elaine May conjures an ineffable, lethal sexiness, her myopic naivete perfectly complementing her gentle intellectual clarity.  The film is an immaculate, fierce, luminous, huge-hearted gem.</p>
