<p>Hunters journey into unknown, hostile areas of the swamp. One team, acting on a tip from a local buyer, heads to an area believed to be cursed. Another team visits a hazardous storm-altered marsh to fight numerous dangerous gators on dry ground, while another hunter is hell bent on hauling in 32 gators in one day.</p>
