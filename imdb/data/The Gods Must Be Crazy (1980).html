<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that had such innocent joy - I'm not sure if any other movie I've seen had any innocent joy, for that matter.Perhaps what true joy I've seen in movies is civilized and therefore self-conscious.Anyway, you can look at the crazy civilized world through the eyes of these innocents and have joy about it instead of cynicism. Can ordinary pain relievers do that?The premise is how one empty Coke bottle in the garden of Eden could corrupt it. They do a totally believable job of it, too.Lots of laughs, kids loved it. I saw it in the theaters in the mid-80's and am glad I saw it again. You'll like it. It will lighten your heart.</p>
