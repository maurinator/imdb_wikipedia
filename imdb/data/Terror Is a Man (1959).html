<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Blood Creature is one of those old drive in type movies which is actually its a pretty good film. Francis Lederer and Richard Derr is in the movie and so is Greta Thyssen who was in a few of the Three Stooges shorts in the Joe Besser era. She actually has very big part in the film. This movie, Blood Creature has some very good acting in it and the storms were cools. The creature itself was neat looking which really looked like a humanoid panther mummy! If you have seen The 1996 version of The Island of Dr. Moreau you will notice some scenes that was in that movie are very similar in this movie! Really Blood Creature is decent little old film that has many great moments and especially if you are a a Three Stooges fan its interesting to see Greta Thyssen in a role where she is scared and screaming! For horror and Island of Dr. Moreau fans don't miss this one!</p>
