<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chevy Chase in very good performance, serious, responsible prospect for step father but fun, most of all fun winning the people. Mr. Wendt my very favorite funny guy excellent again!. Scenes full of good taste and detail, very well informed on Indian costumes.So if you have the time with the children this is an excellent option for the weekend.By the way I am very surprised by the very good way Mrs. Farrah Fawcett still looks. Beautiful on her 48th birthday celebrated while making the movie. Would you believe she hardly looks 35?, good for her.</p>
