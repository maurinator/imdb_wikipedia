<h1>Larceny (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Con-artist Betsy Bigley, ruined and imprisoned by a corrupt judge, fakes her own death to escape from jail and launches an elaborate scheme of revenge against him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has all the twists and turns of The Sting. As well as the comedy, action, suspense and final justice. I just wish it was available to see on t.v. again. All the good movies seem to be hidden and kept away from us.</p>
