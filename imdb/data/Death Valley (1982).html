<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was one of the many slashers that kinda came and went during the 1980's. Not one of the remembered ones though and not quite a classic though, but still a decent movie.The storyline is different from the usual fodder instead of featuring a group of thirty year old teenagers, we get a young boy named Billy who goes to visit his mother and stepfather and the three of them decide to take a little holiday to the infamous "Death Valley" where Billy stumbles upon a crime scene and then becomes the target of a serial killer, who then starts to stalk him."Death Valley" really does have a decent story line and interesting characters allowing us time to get to know each of them, but it does lack in the actual slashing department, but it's actually more story driven than most and the killer was actually quite menacing, he wears no mask or anything and no motive which makes things even more creepier. But the pacing of this movie doesn't quite pick up speed and it does get rather tiresome at times, but the scene where the boy is being stalked does keep you at the edge of your seat and creates tension and the twist at the end was pretty decent and came to a total surprise.The acting was really good which is kind of rare for an 80's slasher movie. Peter Billingsley was spot on as the young Billy he was really good. Catherine Hicks was also a real highlight in this movie as well and who I recognize from the first Chucky movie, nice to see her in another horror movie. Paul Lemat was also decent as the stepfather as well and Stephen McHattie who played the creepy serial killer was menacing and really decent also.All in all a decent enough movie, not much in the blood or gore department but still worth a look if you're into forgotten movies.</p>
