<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whoever it was that called this film dry and dull deserves to be shot! Bruce Willis shines in this witty and hilarious "old western" that never got the recognition it deserved. Willis plays a tv cowboy who gets paired up with James Garner(Wyat Earp) who, unbelievable as it may seem, is even better than Willis! This unlikely duo causes riot after riot and just when it seems like u are totally lost in the film, they wrap it up with dignity and class. This film may not be "Die Hard", but in my opinion deserves just as much recognition!</p>
