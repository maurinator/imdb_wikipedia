<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies - great film noir and certain to have a cult following.  I saw it because I am always fascinated with the characters Harvey Keitel plays - he brings an emotional and physical intensity to his roles that is unequaled.  Here he is outstanding as Roy Egan- an experienced, complicated thief who never says much.  He is convinced by his brother Lee to rob a jewelry store ( when is Harvey going to learn not to rob jewelry stores?) They are joined by Lee's friends Jorge and Skip - these are four macho guys who we care about because they care about each other - except Skip who doesn't seem to care about anything.  When the heist goes bad, Roy spends the rest of the movie hunting down the guy who betrayed him. There is a scene when Roy is alone in a hotel room and begins to pound a table - even though he says nothing, we can feel his fury and frustration building - this is Keitel at his best.  All the acting in this movie is great - the four male leads are well- cast and work well together, and Jorge's wife Rachel is sympathetic as a young mother who wants to do what's best for her kids.  Elliot Gould has a small part as a loan shark and Lucy Liu shows up briefly as an exotic dancer.  The locations are interesting - this is the true dark side of L.A., and the ending - though violent- is satisfying and stays with you.  This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. City of Industry will grab you and pull you in at the opening credits and not let you go until the very end.</p>
