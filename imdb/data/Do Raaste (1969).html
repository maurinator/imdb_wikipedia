<p>This is the story of the Gupta family. Embodied with traditional respect for elders and dignity for self, consists of Mrs. Gupta (Veena), her elder son Navendru Gupta (Balraj Sahni), Navendru's wife Madhvi (Kamini Kaushal); second son Birju Gupta (Prem Chopra); the third son, Satyan Gupta (Rajesh Khanna); one daughter Geeta (Kumud Bole), and Navendru's son, Raju (Junior Mehmood). The family gets a proposal for marriage from Alloppee Prasad (Asit Sen) and his wife Bhagwanti (Leela Mishra) for Birju, which the family accepts. The bride-to-be Neelu (Bindu) has been abroad and is non-traditional with a broad and outgoing outlook, and makes this known at the very first meeting with the Gupta family. Mrs. Gupta does not appreciate this, but Navendru convinces her, and the marriage takes place. Neelu has a younger sister, the beautiful and stunning Reena (Mumtaz), who goes to the same college as Satyan, and both meet amidst misunderstandings, both comic and embrassing, and eventually both fall in love with each other. Navendru has taken a loan of a large sum of money from a money-lender, and when the time comes to pay, Navendru does not have the money, and Birju's wife refuses to share and pay the money to Navendru. Misunderstandings and quarrels take place in the household, and ultimately Neelu and Birju move out to their own place. The Gupta family lose their home to their creditors, whilst Birju and Neelu continue to live a life of luxury. Meanwhile, Satyan has given up hope on a happily married life with his sweetheart Reena. How will the family resolve these problems is best seen in the movie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Do Raaste" portrays the aspirations & disappointments of a middle class family. The head of the Gupta family, Balraj Sahni manages with great difficulty to educate Prem Chopra, his younger brother abroad for which he had to mortgage his ancestral home. Prem Chopra returns and marries Bindu a rich girl. Tensions arise due to Bindu's behaviour and Prem & wife shift to a new home. Prem, who has got a very good job refuses to share Balraj's burden. The tired old Balraj, who has lost his job, is not able to repay back the loan and is kicked out of his home along with his family. This devastates Balraj. In the end Prem realizes that he has stopped loving his family due to Bindu's machinations and reconciles with Balraj.The film revolves around Balraj -his hopes, responsibilities, aspirations & misfortunes. The romance of Rajesh Khanna & Mumtaz is incidental to the script but provides lilting songs. The brilliant script & Raj Khosla's superb direction holds the viewer's interest.</p>
