<h1>Wild Strawberries (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>With the exception of his elderly housekeeper Miss Agda who he treats almost like a surrogate platonic wife, widowed seventy-eight year old Dr. Isak Borg, a former medical doctor and professor, has retreated from any human contact, partly his own want but partly the decision of others who do not want to spend time with him because of his cold demeanor. He is traveling from his home in Stockholm to Lund to accept an honorary degree. Instead of flying as was the original plan, he decides to take the day long drive instead. Along for the ride is his daughter-in-law Marianne, who had been staying with him for the month but has now decided to go home. The many stops and encounters along the way make him reminisce about various parts of his life. Those stops which make him reminisce directly are at his childhood summer home, at the home of his equally emotionally cold mother, and at a gas station where the attendants praise him as a man for his work. But the lives of other people they encounter almost mirror his own, including hitchhikers Sara, Viktor and Anders - who remind him of his cousin Sara who he was going to marry, himself and his irresponsible brother Sigfrid who Sara eventually married - a bickering married couple Sten and Berit Alman, and Marianne and her husband and Isak's son Evald, whose marriage is as strained as was his own.</p>
<p>Dr. Isak Borg, now 78 years old, is traveling by car to Lund to receive an honorary degree at Lund cathedral. He's traveling with his daughter-in-law Marianne, who is married to his son Evald. Isak now lives a lonely life which, by his own admission, is partly his own fault having consciously withdrawn from most social interaction. Along the way he stops at his family's summer home where he spent time during the first 20 years of his life. It's the place where the wild strawberries grow and he recalls his beautiful cousin Sara to whom he was secretly engaged until his brother Sigfrid snatches her away. They give a ride to several people along the way including a girl - also named Sara - and her two friends along with a married couple who almost ran them off the road. Borg's reminiscences and disturbing dreams add to his melancholy as he questions some of the decisions he has made in his life.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A gorgeous movie about memory and hope. A trip and a form of catharsis. It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, about a marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is a mirror. The same crisis is the "gift" of everybody. The same silence, fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American or Irakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past like only reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye. It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books, some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of our hours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smile are the trees of their presence. Isak Borg is the image of a age. Our age who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only way to be yourself. The way to Lund, the relation with Agda, the empty attitude, the projection in Evald, the words are the symbols of a clock who is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only reality of our life.</p>
