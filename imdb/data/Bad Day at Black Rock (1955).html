<h1>Bad Day at Black Rock (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From the time John J. Macreedy steps off the train in Black Rock, he feels a chill from the local residents. The town is only a speck on the map and few if any strangers ever come to the place. Macreedy himself is tight-lipped about the purpose of his trip and he finds that the hotel refuses him a room, the local garage refuses to rent him a car and the sheriff is a useless drunkard. It's apparent that the locals have something to hide but when he finally tells them that he is there to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Kamoko, he touches a nerve so sensitive that he will spend the next 24 hours fighting for his life.</p>
<p>When the streamliner stops at Black Rock for the first time in four years, the mysterious one-armed stranger John J. Macreedy disembarks and asks how to reach Adobe Flat to meet the Japanese-American farmer Kamoko. He is not allowed to check-in the hotel and he is not able to rent a car. Soon he notes that the sheriff is a drunkard and the resident Reno Smith rules the place with his henchmen Hector David and Coley Trimble. Further he feels that the inhabitants are hiding something. When he finally succeeds to rent a jeep from Liz Wirth, he drives to Adobe Flat and finds the farmhouse burned to the ground. He immediately concludes what might have happened to Kamoko and tries to communicate with the state police, but he discovers that communication is controlled by Smith. Further, the veterinarian Doc Velie tells that his life is in danger and unsuccessfully tries to help him to escape. Who is John J. Macreedy and what will happen to him?</p>
<p>John J. Macreedy doesn't know it, but when he steps off the train at the jerkwater town of Black Rock, he will soon find himself the object of fear, hatred, and even a murder plot! The altruistic Macreedy came to Black Rock to hand over a posthumous military award to a local man whose son had died gallantly in the Second World War. What Macreedy couldn't know when he stepped off of that train was that the town had a shameful secret, one that must be kept at all costs.</p>
<p>It's 1945, a couple of weeks after the official end of the war. For the first time in four years, the streamliner stops in the small American western desert town of Black Rock, and off the train steps John J. Macreedy. Wearing a suit, he's a middle aged man with a lame left arm who has never been to Black Rock. Without even knowing who he is or what his story is, the townsfolk are suspicious of Macreedy. They learn that he is only in town for 24 hours when the streamliner will pick him up the next day to take him to Los Angeles, where he will "restart" his life. His trip to Black Rock is to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Komoko who supposedly lives in Adobe Flat. No one in town is willing to help Macreedy locate Komoko. As Macreedy is on his search to find Komoko, he comes to the realization that Reno Smith is the town's leader in whatever they are hiding. Everyone else in town is either in cahoots with Smith, or is unwilling to help for fear of reprisal from Smith and his associates. Those unwilling to help include such influential people as the town's sheriff, the switchboard operator and the telegraph operator. As those in cahoots with Smith try to provoke Macreedy, he also realizes that they are trying to have a reason to kill him. Regardless, Macreedy knows that without help, he will be dead before morning comes as he has no access to either a vehicle or means of communication to the outside world. When he finds out the secret the town is keeping, Macreedy does whatever he needs to save his life and in the process save the town from the scourge that has hung over it for four years.</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack on the Pearl Harbor, the unconditional surrender of Japan, and the resultant hatred towards Japanese-Americans, one-armed John J. Macreedy alights at Black Rock from a train in order to give a medal to the last known relative, Komoko, of a deceased Japanese-American army officer, Joe. His attempts to do so will pit him against the entire town - including the Sheriff himself - that is intent on covering up a dark secret; attempts will be made to run him off the road while driving; he will be threatened, and the telephone operator will refuse to connect him to the State Police; the Railway Station's employee will not dispatch a telegram; while the local Mortician will warn him that he should prepare for his death by nightfall.</p>
<p>A one-handed stranger comes to a tiny town possessing a terrible past they want to keep secret, by violent means if necessary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For the first time in 4 years the train stops at the small desert town of Black Rock.  An one armed war veteran gets off looking for a man whose name causes hostility among the residents of the town, led by Reno Smith.  Macreedy digs deeper to find a town hiding a shameful secret that they were too apathetic to deal with.  But will they stand up now?Most people will tell you this film is famous because it was one of the first times an American film acknowledged that, after Pearl Harbour, oriental Americans were abused and treated badly.  However to me this film is a damnation to those who stand back and refuse to take a stand against wrong doing.  The whole plot is hinged on whether or not people ill stand up and do the right thing with Macreedy.  The film plays well as a moral fable but also as a tense thriller and both are enjoyable.The film is quite short, but builds well from hostile locals to eventual violence and confrontation in the desert.  The moral of taking a stand is weaved into it well without taking away from the main drama and tension.  It isn't perfect as it is a bit simplified but in the desert heat of the small town the tension is really well recreated.The cast is surprisingly deep in hindsight.  Tracy is manners himself as the man who gets more irate by the apathy around him as he gets to uncover more and more of the town.  Ryan is cool but a little too inhuman for my tastes.  Jagger and Brennan are suitably trapped in their performances and represent those happy to watch bad things happen if they get a quiet life.  In retrospect Borgnine and Marvin add star power and do well with what could have been just thug/heavy roles.Overall this film worked for me on several levels.  The heat of the desert adds to the tension in the actual drama story itself.  However it also works as a moral fable with a very clear message Â– stand up for what is right or watch what you believe slip away at an alarming rate.</p>
