<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am going to disagree with most of the reviewers in here and say that I found the story to be quite intriguing.  Some of it was a little out there but the crux of it ( the town conspiracy ) was quite well done.  What wasn't so great was some of the acting and some of the things people do to get themselves in trouble.The film starts off with Ronny Cox and his wife traveling down some lonely Mississippi road in the dead of night.  They spin off the road and the front of his car ends up on some moist land.  His tires spin and spin but they will not respond.  The car is stuck there.  Now instead of A) trying to push the car out or B) both of them walking back to the gas station for a tow, Cox tells his wife that he is going back to that gas station for a tow.  He playfully tells her to stay there and to lock the door ( he says it as though nothing bad could have ever happened on the side of the road in Mississippi.  Does anyone ever remember MISSISSIPPI BURNING?)  Okay, we have all seen too many horror movies but that is just dumb, horror movie or not.  You never leave someone alone, on a deserted road while you are surrounded by the dense bush.  Anything could happen.  Bigfoot could jump out.  Jason could be close by.  The thing from THE PREY could pop and get you or more realistically you would just be too afraid to stay by yourself because it is dark.  But she does and of course something attacks her and rapes her and then the film jumps ahead 17 years where of course she had the baby.  This is another part when we all go " Oh Come ON!!! What are you, stupid?"  If some big disgusting swamp thing with calves the size of the Caveman in Scooby Doo episodes raped you, you get an abortion, right away.  But again, this is a horror movie and people have to do stupid things to get themselves into the prediciments that they are in.  If you can get past some of this sheer idiocy, the rest of the story is quite good.  It is not on par with some of the greats but it is a worthy addition to the early 80's horror.One by one, the slimy town folk are being attacked and devoured by a beast.  Now we don't know why these people are being stalked, only that they are suspect looking to say the least.  There is obviously some town secret that is being swept under the proverbial rug and these people are the main culprits.  The final thirty minutes is quite good.  I can remember being about 13 when me and my friends rented this film for the first time.  We accepted the challenge on the front of the box where it dares you to watch the last thirty minutes without chickening out.  And when you are 13 and are challenged like that, you eagerly accept.  None of us were horrified but we sure thought it was cool.  Now that I have more of an appreciation for horror and the effects that go into it, I have to say that the creature effects were astonishing here.  Rick Baker would be proud of Thomas Burman.  This is on par with Baker's work in AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  The transformation scene is truly a work of art.  Perhaps people will say that it is dated because now a days they use computer graphics to make everything look real but let me tell you, give me guys like Rick Baker, Stan Winston and Thomas Burman and I would rather watch them at work than a chip and a computer program that does the same thing.  This is fun to watch and I believe more work and innovation goes into the process.I would give this film a 6 out of 10.  The story is intriguing and the plot is carried out quite well.  And look at it this way.  Take most horror films from today like URBAN LEGEND, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID..... and so on and compare them to this one and others like it from the 70's and early 80's.  Most 90's films can't hold the director's Cole's Notes to how to make an affective horror film.  The Beast Within is better than 95% of the horror that was released in the 90's.  It is getting better now with stellar efforts like FINAL DESTINATION, BLAIR WITH, SIXTH SENSE, STIR OF ECHOES and even  STIGMATA.  Their roots lie with films like this.</p>
