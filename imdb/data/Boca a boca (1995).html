<h1>Boca a boca (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>For financial reasons an unemployed aspiring actor works for a phone-sex enterprise. One day he receives a call from the mysterious wife of one of his best clients.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Typical story of actor down on his luck, taking menial jobs to support oneself. This one takes a turn where the protagonist ends up working for a 1-900 sex line, and there starts an often madcap story. A good, biting wit in the script and some good performances makes BOCA A BOCA (MOUTH TO MOUTH) very worthwhile. Recommended.</p>
