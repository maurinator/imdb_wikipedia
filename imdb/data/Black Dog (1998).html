<h1>Black Dog (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An ex-con takes a job driving a truck cross country. What he doesn't know is that the truck is filled with illegal weapons and now he must fight to survive and save his family.</p>
<p>Ex-con Jack Crews, who works as car mechanic in New Jersey since he's out and enjoys being a good husband and father to his daughter, refused to do it as his license was suspended, but when he finds the bank is about to foreclose on his house, he has no other choice then accept $10,000 for one truck ride all the way from Atlanta. He doesn't want to know about the load, but guesses right as it comes with a black dog, spare driver and two men 'protection' in a car that his long ride is about to turn into a mobile battle fought with vehicles and bullets for the illegal arms shipment which the FBI is after too while Red, who send the load in the first place, turns out to head a gang which stops at nothing to get them delivered. And then there's the legend of the ominous black dog...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, it has many a plot hole. Yes, the acting isn't Oscar worthy. And yes, it's a cheesy B-grade movie. But guess what? I like it. "Black Dog" is a silly trucker action/thriller topped off with comedy, both intentional and unintentional, and a really, really cool country music score. The reason why so many people don't like it is simply 'cause they are taking it far too seriously. If you're like me and have had plenty of warning NOT to take "Black Dog" so seriously (thanks to the other IMDb members), then you'll like "Black Dog". In short, DO NOT expect "Black Dog" to be something like "Donnie Darko" and/or "Fight Club". Don't take it seriously and you may just have a rollicking good time, especially if you are a fan of anyone who stars in it.</p>
