<h1>Woman's World (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Needing to fill the position of general manager of his company, and believing that an executive's wife is crucial to her husband's success, auto industry mogul Gifford brings three couples to New York to size up: Jerry and Carol: he hard-driven and self-reliant, she willing to use her beauty to further her husband's career; Sid and Elizabeth, he ulcer-ridden and torn between achieving success and restoring their troubled marriage, she positive that his job will kill him, but gamely agreeing to play the good wife for the duration; and down-to-earth Bill, whose good-natured Katie fears that his promotion would spell the end of their idyllic familiy existence.</p>
<p>Van Heflin As Jerry Talbot</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent film depicting 3 nominated men for a top executive job at Gifford Motors.The ever perfect Clifton Webb shall decide who gets this top spot.The nominees are Cornel Wilde, Fred MacMurray and Van Heflin, but their wives shall play a crucial role in determining who gets the job since Webb is from the old school that behind every man is a woman....June Allyson, married to Wilde, is terrific as the ditsy-klutzy wife who can't seem to do anything right. She really doesn't want her husband to get the job and she makes no bones about it.Lauren Bacall is wed to MacMurray. Their marriage has hit the rocks and Bacall vows to leave him after he gets the precious job. She sees the job as a stress-related killer. The most vicious of them is Heflin's Arlene Dahl-vicious to the hilt, she will do anything to get her man the top post.The ending is marvelously staged and well deserved to all the contestants and their respective spouses.</p>
