<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Leonard Maltin lists "Murderer's Row" as a BOMB, but personally I liked it more than the first Matt Helm outing, "The Silencers". Don't get me wrong, it's not a great movie, the pacing could have been snappier, the special effects could have been better, etc., but it surpasses the original in most categories: for one thing, it is funnier - it actually made me laugh out loud once or twice; for another thing, the French Riviera provides far more attractive locations than Phoenix, Arizona; for yet another, this film, unlike the first, actually has a proper, Oddjob-like henchman; and perhaps most importantly of all, Karl Malden is an immeasurably better villain than Victor Buono. Buono was barely in the film, and was almost 100% camp. Malden has a much bigger role, and some surprisingly serious, even cruel moments. Of course you could argue that "The Silencers" had the superior set of girls, and it's true that Camilla Sparv doesn't have the exotic looks of Daliah Lavi, or an equally active role. She does have great abs, though. Ann-Margret gives an energetic performance and proves to be a most helpful assistant to Matt Helm (though their 20+ years of age difference does make them kind of awkward as a romantic couple). She also has great abs. Overall an enjoyable film, about on the level of a lesser James Bond adventure. **1/2 out of 4.</p>
