<h1>California Conquest (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The period is the 1840's and California is part of Mexico. Many of the citizens wish to become part of the United States. Other countries are also interested and the Russians have established bases in the northern part of the territory. To further their hold they have stolen guns and Don Arturo Bordega, a leader of those wanting statehood, is out to recover them.</p>
<p>Don Arturo Bordega, the leader of a wealthy group of Spanish Californians who are tired of Mexican rule, and fear British, French and Russian claims on the territory, are fighting for peace and freedom to achieve annexation from the United States of America. Fredo Brios, another Spanish California, secretly plots for the Russians to take over, as he has been promised to be named the Russian governor. While leading the fight against Brios, Bordega meets and falls in love with Julia Lawrence, the daughter of an American gunsmith settler.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>California Conquest tells the story of the battle for rule of what will eventually become a state, when gold is found here later. Teresa Wright does a good job as the daughter of a settler who is determined to get her married off to famed explorer John Fremont. As someone else has pointed out, what a mishmash of crappy accents that come and go, and about half the actors just mumble for some reason to the point of distraction. Cornel Wilde is Arturo Bodega (Bordega ?), fighting off the interloping Russians, but he sounds like a European. We get the usual amount of swordfights, gunfights, and oat burning horse chases. Some great outdoor photography, presumably California. Several of the scenes are very dark, and its hard to see what is occurring; not sure if its just bad lighting, or film degradation. There is the usual climactic battle of good versus evil at the very end. Entertaining, but Teresa Wright is the only shining star in this one.Directed by Lew Landers, who had a long history in Hollywood; acc to wikipedia, he acted in two shorts around 1914, when he would have been about 12. He disappears for 15 years (war? working?) Then he pops up as crew on one film, and disappears again for about five years. Then starts a long career as director in 1934, and had been directing for almost 20 years when this film was made.</p>
