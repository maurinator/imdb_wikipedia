<h1>Judge Dredd (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the year 2139, the Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place called the Cursed Earth. All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet, now known as Mega-Cities. The crimes in these Mega-Cities became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely. However, a new justice system came from the ashes, there were three justice systems in one (police, jury and executioner), they were called Judges. In Mega-City One (formerly, New York City), there was a Judge, named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history. One day, he was charged with murder, and was tried and sentenced to life in prison because of it.</p>
<p>In a standard comic book dystopian near-future, Americans are ensconced in Mega-Cities which protect them from the desolation of the world outside, and the peace is kept by the Judges. This elite group who upholds the Law is police, jury and executioner all in one. Judge Joseph Dredd, the most formidable and revered of the Street Judges, is convicted of the murder of a snooping reporter. With the help of a prisoner who he himself convicted, Dredd sets out to clear his name while leaving a trail of destruction, snappy catchphrases, and dazzling special effects in his wake.</p>
<p>In the future, the Earth transforms into a desert wasteland called the Cursed Earth. Crowds of people now live within walled Mega-Cities where crime is out-of-control and elite police forces (The Judges. Judge, Jury and Executioners all in one) enforces law and justice in the Mega-Cities. Judge Joseph Dredd, the greatest Judge in Mega-City One is framed for the assassination of a journalist and his wife by renegade Judge Rico. Learning the truth about himself from Chief Justice Fargo, head of the council of Judges. Dredd with help from colleague and trusted friend Judge Hershey and cowardly computer hacker Fergie sets out to take on Rico, corrupt council member Judge Griffin, genetics scientist Ilsa Hayden and the super-strong ABC robot and put a stop to their evil plan involving genetic engineering (The key to the secrets of Dredd's past) and unleashing chaos and destruction in Mega-City One.</p>
<p>In a dystopic future, where urban areas have grown into Mega-Cities that cover entire coastal regions, the justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury and executioner: the Judge. Among the Judges of Mega-City One, Judge Joseph Dredd is one of the best, and a particular favorite of the Head of the Council, Chief Justice Fargo. But there are evil forces at work in the Justice Department: block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he did not commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.</p>
<p>In a dystopian future, Joseph Dredd, the most famous Judge (a police officer with instant field judiciary powers), is convicted for a crime he did not commit and must face his murderous counterpart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the future the world has been scorched and is uninhabitable.  The cities are overflowing and cramped.  Violence and crime has gotten to the stages that the courts and juries of the past were unable to cope.  The Judges were planned to be police, judge and executioners  the ultimate law keepers.  The strictest of these is Judge Dredd.  However Dredd's history is revealed when his long-forgotten genetic twin escapes from captivity and kills high ranking council members.  The DNA evidence points to Dredd and he is sentenced accordingly.  However he escapes with hacker Fergie and returns to the city to try and stop Rico's plan for his own laws.It's been a few years since I saw this in the cinema and I thought I'd give it another go.  However I had only average memories of it  memories that were pretty close to the mark now that I've seen it again.  The film starts reasonably well and has a good little bit of humour in it  the recycling bot that says `recycle waste for food, it's good for the environment and OK for you!' is my favourite!  However any nice touches like this and any debate on the nature of the Judges is quickly lost in a by-the-numbers blockbuster.The action is OK but not great and the film doesn't manage to ever really have a genuine sense of excitement or tension.  Director Cannon is much better at style than substance and here he proves that again.  The cartoon violence will be OK for teenagers but is too basic and undemanding for many I think.  The cityscapes are quite good but a tad OTT.  Bladerunner got it pitch perfect all those years ago and every film since has tried to up the ante unnecessarily.Stallone is a pretty good choice for Dredd because of his strong chin.  I didn't care less if he removed his helmet or not, but his constant speaking in catchphrases did annoy me a bit.  Oh  and I've heard a life time of `law' and `court' puns and kiss-off lines.  Schneider is a misjudged comedy sidekick, he isn't used well and just gets in the way.  The film would have been better without his `relief' and gone darker.  Assante is a strong villain and the council is full of famous faces.  Lane has nothing to do as Judge Hershey.Overall this is a cartoon for teenagers and those just looking for lots of bangs.  However, even for that crowd this may prove a little basic  I wanted it to be more sophisticated than it was and be darker (but not just violent as it has been misinterpreted as here).  Maybe worth a watch with a beer and pizza but the fact that we haven't been treated to a JD2 speaks volumes.</p>
