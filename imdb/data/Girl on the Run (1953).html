<p>Girl on the Run (1953) ** (out of 4) A reporter (Richard Coogan) and his girlfriend (Rosemary Pettit) are on the run from the police and hide out at a carnival sideshow where they try to gather evidence to clear his name.GIRL ON THE RUN is a fairly forgettable crime picture that has a rather routine and boring story that really doesn't do much or go anywhere. This film is sold as an adult noir but the crime elements just don't work well enough for it to be too successful. Where the film does succeed is with its atmosphere and setting. The circus setting is actually quite excellent and there's a nice atmosphere that really puts you in this circus. It will certainly remind you of FREAKS and other exploitation pictures from the 30s.Another thing the film is known for is for the first screen appearance of Steve McQueen. Yes, the Steve McQueen who would go onto appear in THE BLOB, THE GREAT ESCAPE and THE GETAWAY. You can see him early in the picture looking very young with a funny haircut. The performances for the most part are okay as is the cinematography. GIRL ON THE RUN is a decent "C" film but it's too bad that the setting wasn't used for something better.</p>
