<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joan Britton, improbably gorgeous frontier horse dealer, and the much less scrupulous Stephen Cook are friendly competitors supplying horses to the Union Army in Wyoming Territory during the Civil War. Southern general Stand Watie, a Cherokee, is rumored to be in the area to stir up the Sioux against the Union, when Cook picks this worst possible moment to steal a herd of Sioux horses. Enter ex-army doctor Jonathan Westgate, who becomes Cook's rival for the love of Joan, opposes his crooked activities...and who alone can prevent a new Indian war.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, Southern agitators and a crooked horse dealer endanger the peace between the Union and the Wyoming Sioux.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Great Sioux Uprising in the tradition of B westerns is a misnomer of a title. No great uprising takes place though not for Lyle Bettger's efforts to get one started.During the Civil War Bettger is a horse dealer and the biggest one around. He'd like to merge with another dealer, Faith Domergue and crush his other competitors. The reason he's the biggest horse dealer around is that Bettger steals his horses from the Indians and gets top dollar for them from the army. Kind of an unfair advantage don't you think?Enter Jeff Chandler former Union Army surgeon now a veterinarian who has given people doctoring because of a war wound and now tends to animals. He sees what Bettger is doing and tries to organize the opposition, but Bettger is a very clever villain if a little less psychotic than he usually is in films.There's also a Confederate general in the area looking to make his own deal with the Sioux. It all adds up to an interesting western of the Civil War era.There are some interesting supporting performances by friendly blacksmith Peter Whitney and from Stacy Harris a really mean psychotic sort who is Bettger's right hand man. For Jeff Chandler's loyal legion of fans.</p>
