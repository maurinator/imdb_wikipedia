<h1>Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson are two black cops with a reputation for breaking the odd head. Both are annoyed at the success of the Reverend Deke O'Mailey who is selling trips back to Africa to the poor on the installment plan. When his truck is hijacked and a bale of cotton stuffed with money is lost in the chase, Harlem is turned upside down by Gravedigger and Coffin Ed, the Reverend, and the hijackers. Much of the humor is urban black, which was unusual in 1970.</p>
<p>The Charismatic black nationalist leader Rev Deke O'Malley is trying to sell the people of Harlem a dream. Invest $100 in his company and live in Africa. But cops Gravedigger and Coffin know all about Deke and his fraudulent schemes that take advantage of the poor and the ignorant and can't wait for a chance to expose him. When a barbecue O'Malley is apparently 'robbed' they get their chance to take him and his cohorts down.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cambridge and St. Jacques are one of all time best buddy cop duos.  They are hip, sexy, and funny.  The mystery is intriguing, and the uncomfortable situations keep the viewer's attention throughout.  This is one to be seen uncut, because a lot of the humor is quite racy.  It's a time capsule in a way also since the Harlem depicted here no longer exists.</p>
