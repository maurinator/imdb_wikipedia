<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A handsome gigolo (Rob Lowe) charms his way into the life of a beautiful young woman, heiress to a multi-million dollar fortune. After the loss of her mother, she lives with her selfish and domineering stepfather, a ruthless cad intent on controlling both his stepdaughter's inheritance and her relationships. The local police officer also shows emotional interest in the heiress, having known her since childhood. But who can she really trust? 'Masquerade' was filmed around the time of 'Bad Influence' and Rob Lowe's scandal --- a sometimes underrated actor who, for a while, was typecast as the bad boy (see 'Waynes World', 'Tommy Boy' and 'Austin Powers'). Lowe has nevertheless proved his versatility as an actor with leading roles in films such as Stephen King's 'The Stand' (a deaf mute), Frank and Jesse (as Jesse James) and Stephen King's 'Salems Lot' (2005). He adopts the role of deceptive gigolo with veritable ease, appearing simultaneously charming and devious. It is the script that inevitably lets the film down.In short it is a dark and moody thriller, which focuses on the themes of money and greed, trust and betrayal. It is reasonably-paced and contains a multitude of twists and turns, though could be a bit more lively in places. Furthermore, it boasts a talented supporting cast that includes Meg Tilly, Doug Savant, John Glover and Kim Cattrall.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.</p>
