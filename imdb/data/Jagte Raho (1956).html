<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In hopes of improving his lifestyle, a poor peasant re-locates to Bombay virtually penniless. It is late at night and he is thirsty, and he is unable to find water anywhere. A singing drunk offers him money to buy some alcohol, but the money is snatched away by a taxi-driver. In desperation, the peasant attempts to drink from a fire hydrant, but is stopped by a Police Constable. Then he sneaks into a multi-storied apartment complex, and is mistaken for a thief. The entire building, which consists of over 200 units, housing nearly a 1000 people, set out to hunt him down. He first stumbles into the house of Kailash - who makes illicit alcohol, while his daughter is secretly romancing another tenant, Pradeep; the peasant then runs into another apartment - just in time to see the husband attempting to steal his wife, Meenu's valuables, so that he can get enough money to gamble on a race-horse; he hides in a drum and makes his way around the huge building and ends up as a corpse at the apartment of Ramnarayan Malik, who prints counterfeit rupee notes. Watch what happens when he earns the wrath of Ramnarayan and his men, ends up on a drain pipe several stories high - with scores of residents hurling stones at him - and Ramnarayan's men waiting on the terrace with weapons to kill him.</p>
<p>When a poor migrant peasant arrives in the city of Calcutta late at night, he is terribly thirsty but cannot find any drinking water. The search for water takes him on a nightmarish journey through the underbelly of a middle-class residential complex where he witnesses all kinds of hypocrisy and where he finds himself trapped as a dangerous criminal, hunted down by hundreds of self-proclaimed exterminators of evil.</p>
<p>Entering an apartment block in search of a drink of water, a naive peasant finds himself mistaken for a thief and is chased by the residents. Whilst evading capture, he inadvertently exposes the venality and dishonesty of the building's middle class occupants.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Movie is a masterpiece.Why? The user before me already explained before me. I am from Bengal & Satyajit Ray obviously occupies a very high place in my heart. But Raj Kapoor was also unparalleled in his own domain. First person to introduce dream sequence in a song, First person to shoot a movie outside of his country & finally Bobby the movie which ushered in the whole era of teen romance. This movie exposes the mask that the so called good people wear in our society , the sanctimonious ones with holier than thou attitudes. However one thing I have to say about this that the Bengali version is just brilliant. Role which is played by Motilal in the Hindi Version is played by Chabbi Biswas. Chabbi Biswas if anyone has seen him will know that he was& still is the best actor in India.He was an actor of caliber who told Ray, when he was been instructed by Ray in the movie Jalshaghar, that not to tell him what his job was. Coming back to the movie if anyone manages to watch the Bengali version of this movie please do.Its way better than the Hindi Version.</p>
