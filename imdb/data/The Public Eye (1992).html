<h1>The Public Eye (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Leon Bernstein is New York's best news photographer in 1942, equally at home with cops or crooks. The pictures are often of death and pain, but they are the ones the others wish they had got. Then glamorous Kay Levitz turns to him when the Mob seem to be muscling in on the club she owns due to some arrangement with her late husband. Bernstein, none too successful with women, agrees to help, saying there may be some good photos in it for him. In fact, he is falling in love with Kay.</p>
<p>Story of a 1940s photographer who specializes in crime and in not getting involved... until this time.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'The Public Eye' has been one of my favorites since I first saw it ... my personal interest in Black & White photography initially attracted me to it, but, after watching it several times, I have really come to admire the great 'feel' of the film ... the sets are authentic-appearing, lots of attention to detail, they even got the camera and props right ... any fan of film-noir, and period pieces, should love this one ... excellent acting all-around ... Pesci's character comes across as 'real', to me, a very believable portrayal, definitely one of his top performances ... there should have been some Academy Award nominations for this one, in my opinion ... it's a shame 'The Public Eye' hasn't made it to DVD, and been promoted more ... I've always been curious as to Pesci's opinion of this film ... ?</p>
