<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The final episode. Jin gets taken hostage by a group of outlaw car club types (they would have been outlaw bikers, but we couldn't afford the bikes). Our guys have to infiltrate the outlaw group to rescue Jin, who happens to have a data stick on her containing the Military's top secret operating system - with which the Resistance could turn the tide of the war. Our guys get Jin, and the operating system. Decker also faces Devon in a final confrontation.</p>
