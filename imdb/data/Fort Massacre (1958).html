<h1>Fort Massacre (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the Indian Wars in the Southwest, a sergeant assumes command of a cavalry detachment after it is mauled in an Apache ambush that killed its captain and seriously wounded its lieutenant. The surviving troopers must reach either a larger cavalry column or a wagon train the column is to escort. But first they need water and the nearest water hole is in Apache hands....</p>
<p>A cavalry troop finds itself under constant attack by Indians.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Unlike John Ford's celebrated cavalry Westerns, there's no humor or sentimentality in this film.  It shows the grim situations and less than stellar personnel that cavalry commanders often faced.  The interplay between Sergeant Vinson, Private McGurney, and Scout Pawnee is interesting and incisive.  McGurney shows how a miscreant within a unit can be as great a menace as the enemy.  The cinematography is excellent, particularly during riding and water hole sequences.  Worth looking at, especially for Western fans interested in the cavalry.</p>
