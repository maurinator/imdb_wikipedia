<h1>Camping Cosmos (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a campsite at the Belgian coast, the delegate of the Ministry of culture Jan Bucquoy must bring culture nearer to the working class. But the residents of this caravan park prefer to look at soccer, a boxing-match or a beauty-contest. They are not interested in an interview with the famous writer Pierre Mertens. As they are far from home they also want to have some sexual adventures or start a love-affair. The campsite is also the place where everybody wants to live in complete freedom and forget the obligations of everyday-life.</p>
<p>Jacques Calonne, the delegate of the Ministry of Culture is preoccupied with young girls (without touching them) and promises them dolls; the owner of the caravan park monsieur Vandeputte is angry when the autistic artist Herman is painting the caravans. The campsite is plenty with people looking at some beautiful girls during the beauty contest, but some girls receive only 0. There is also a song contest and the daughter of the cultural animator Eve sings "The man I love". The famous writer Pierre Mertens, the same as in "La vie sexuelle des Belges 1950-78" - receives a pie in his face when he speaks in the radio about literature, Ulrique and Sibulsky try to claim their terroristic ideals against publicity at the television and so on. There is the Italian cook boiling French fries while making love with his wife who leaves him afterwards on a motorcycle with Herman. There is the fanatic of Eddy Merckx who brings his cycle everywhere in the camp site and who dies with "Eddy Merckx" on his lips. The radio-operator who is in love with madame Vandeputte. The girlfriend of Eve has her first sexual experience in a car near to the campsite. Above all there is the box-match with the former challenger of Cassius clay.</p>
<p>On a Belgian beach at Camping Cosmos. The delegate send by the Ministry is confronted with sex and murder. The residents enjoy their holidays in a peculiar way...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Apology of bad Belgian tasteThis movie is in the tradition of Belgian Surrealism: Marcel Broothaerdts, Marcel Marien... but there was never a Belgian Surrealist long feature movie. So there it is now. Camping Cosmos develops around the items: Beer, Football and Revolution. Behind, there is the strange story of the daughter of the cultural animator who returns at the campsite where her beloved father is after she was kidnapped in Italy. One does not always know where one should find himself in this patchwork of beauty contests and song contests. The pie throwing of Pierre Mertens is a story in itself too. I believe that the author wanted to give an impression of Belgian working class families on a holiday camp. There is no culture, only sport and entertainment. Everybody looks discouraged because of their interrupted sex life that cannot take ground in this unnatural surroundings with its deprived individuals at the edge of society. The camp site is manned by fascinating individualistic persons who live a life without adventure. There is no hope for a better life on this Belgian beach which has everything of a nudist camp without the flair and the passion of a normal sex life. So this second part of the "Sexual Life of the Belgians" is not only a statement of the lack of cultural life in this vacation circumstances, but also of the sentimental emptiness of the common Belgians at retirement.</p>
