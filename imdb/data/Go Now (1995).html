<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Robert Carlyle delivers a stunning performance in this film.  Starting off as a rough-and-tumble guy, he really shows range as his character opens up emotionally with the development of a romantic relationship, and then begins a struggle with MS.  Confusion, doubt, anger, pain, determination, fear...you name it: he pegs it.Though the plot could've used a bit more work and the other actors aren't as strong as Carlyle, Go Now is still worth a viewing just for his performance alone.  It leaves you with the impression that the film really was made just to be a showcase for his work.  Occasional comic relief from his buddies provided a witty twist, and the soundtrack was top-notch.</p>
