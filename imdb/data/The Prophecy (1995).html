<h1>The Prophecy (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"Some people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too little," says Thomas Daggett. "But how many people lose their faith because Heaven showed them too much?" Daggett nearly became a priest; now he's a cop. He may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up. Suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in Heaven. And once again, Heaven will show him too much: gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse. Even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl. This American Indian child has something Gabriel wants. And Gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path - or even reanimate a corpse or two - to get it.</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel comes to Earth to collect a soul which will end the stalemated war in Heaven, and only a former priest and a little girl can stop him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Clunky but effective cult thriller about a lost chapter in the Book of Revelations which describes a second war in heaven, in which the arch angle Gabriel (Walken) gets cast out.  Gabriel & his minons hate humans because of God's "special treatment" for humanity, and decides to hatch a sinister, and somewhat bizzare, plot to regain his place.  The plot twists are uneven, but an interesting story lies at the core.  Walken is wonderful as the anti-hero Gabriel, and Viggio Mortensen is a total hoot as Satan, Gabriel's rival.  Eric Stoltz's character is underdeveloped, as is the relationship between Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen.    Director Widen gives his angels a refreshing cyberpunk/goth feel, rather like Tim Broadstreet's Vampire drawings - it is effectively disturbing to watch angels dressed like they belong to the Shotgun Mafia, instead of white sheets and feathered wings, but some will be put off by the contrast.  This moovie spawned a less-effective sequel, and rumor has it a third one is in the making!  You can tell Christopher Walken had a blast with this character, and that alone keeps the moovie interesting and effective.  MooCow says if ya don't mind the silly bits, go for it! :¬ç</p>
