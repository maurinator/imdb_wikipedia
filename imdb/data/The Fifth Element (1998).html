<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This game is GREAT! I loved it! Trust me, this game is WORTH buying! OMG!! The graphics rule and the missions rock! This game gives you the option of playing the two main characters, Leeloo and Korben, but you sometimes have to play a character the game tells you to, but the game is mostly both characters, albeit one at a time. My favorite mission is "call from Zorg"-- you'll see. The only two things I didn't like about this game was that on the last mission, you have to play Leeloo first and then Korben and that the game is a *little* blocky. After you play this game, you'll want to watch the movie if you haven't before. It's that AWESOME! Trust me!</p>
