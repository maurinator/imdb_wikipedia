<h1>No Room for the Groom (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alvah, a young GI who happens to own a vineyard, elopes to Las Vegas with Lee, his housekeeper's daughter. But Alvah's chicken pox postpone the wedding night. The rest revolves around more delays to the consummation, caused by Lee's manipulative Mama and the flock of mostly obnoxious relatives with whom she's filled the house.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When they were young contract players at Universal Pictures Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie made four pictures together, Tony was teamed with her almost as much as with his own wife Janet Leigh. Even though No Room For The Groom was about a young married couple unable by circumstances to consummate the deed, these two never consummated anything in real life according to Curtis in his memoirs. Romance surely would have been killed by an airing of this film.Tony plays a young GI on leave to get married to sweetheart Piper Laurie, but on his wedding night comes down with chicken pox. Back to Korea for 10 months before the deed is done, but he allows his bride to move into his house. And Piper moves in with her mother and a dozen or so deadbeat relatives. This is what Tony comes home to and in addition Piper has never told her mother Spring Byington that they're married because Spring wanted her to marry Don DeFore the richest guy in town and who Piper works for.A nice cast is really thoroughly wasted on this tripe. Why Curtis just didn't throw them all out bag and baggage and get down to business still eludes me. I was also surprised that Douglas Sirk who directed some of Universal's best dramas with Rock Hudson in the Fifties was in charge of this mess. I guess he was just fulfilling contractual obligations and couldn't wait to get to a Hudson film. The film does have a hurried look to it, like everyone wanted to get on to other projects.Fortunately Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie went on to do much better work in the Fifties than No Room For The Groom.</p>
