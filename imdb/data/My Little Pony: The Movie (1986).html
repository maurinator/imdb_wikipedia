<h1>My Little Pony: The Movie (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At Dream Castle, the Little Ponies are preparing a festival to celebrate the first day of Spring. From the Volcano of Gloom, the evil witch Hydia watches the event via her cauldron and, disgusted by the frivolity, tells her daughters that they must ruin it. Hydia's daughters, Draggle and Reeka, are inexperienced at causing mischief and fail utterly at ruining the festival. They return to the Volcano of Gloom in disgrace, where Witch Hydia presents a better plan - they'll make Smooze. The sisters collect a series of disgusting ingredients, but neglect to obtain the Phlume, the prospect of which terrifies them. The spell seems to work regardless, creating a pool of sentient purple lava that gleefully buries Ponyland.</p>
<p>Capture the magic and escape to Dream Valley to join all your favourite Little Ponies! Take a magical journey to Ponyland just as the Little Ponies' annual Spring Festival is about to begin. While the ponies enjoy their festive spring party, the evil witch Hydia is up in her gloomy home, the Volcano of Doom, plotting to turn Ponyland into a wasteland. When her first attempt fails, she decides to cover Ponyland with a purple ooze called the "Smooze". It looks like the end of Ponyland, unless all the magical creatures of Dream Valley answer the Ponies' call for help!</p>
<p>Ponyland comes under attack from a talking blob of purple gunk.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In my formative years, I watched this movie almost daily. How my mum put up with that, I'll never know! But one year I lent the videotape to a friend, suddenly changed schools, and never got it back. Oh, a sad period of my childhood! I think I loved this movie as a child because of the bright colors, the pretty ponies, the fact that this was a world of the equine. After all, what girl didn't go through a horsey phase, even if only for a short while? Only now, upon reflection and re-watching, I realize that all the morals the movie was trying to teach never really hit me as a kid.Lines like "It's easy to be courageous when helping others!" totally flew over my small-child head. I don't think they even sunk in subliminally! What I DO know is that to this day, I can sing the songs, word for word and tune for tune.(And yes, my late teens brought on a phase of nostalgia, where I raced from place to place searching for this movie on DVD... God bless eBay, even if the movie turned out to be a complete and utter bootleg. At least I had it. And subjected my poor roommate to many a sing-along with the Smooze song.) If you show this film to your kids -- or watch it yourself -- purely for entertainment (and expecting serious cheese), then you'll enjoy the trip. (Yes, pun intended...) If you're looking for morals to give your kids, or to inspire them, then... You should probably choose something else. This is fluff, pure fluff, with a little "twinkle" added.</p>
