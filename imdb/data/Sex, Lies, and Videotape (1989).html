<h1>Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ann is married to John, who is having an affair with her sister Cynthia. Ann's a quiet type and unwilling to let herself go. When John's old friend, Graham, shows up, all their lives change. Graham likes to videotape interviews with women.</p>
<p>John and Ann Mullany, a junior partner at a law firm and a housewife respectively, are a young, upwardly mobile couple, who most would deem to have a perfect life. Ann's outward perfection belies the fact that she is in therapy, dealing with the stress over worrying about global issues with which she has little to no control. She does not see certain things with which she does have control being problems in her life, namely her sexual repression or her disinterest in sex as an activity, that is until it manifested itself in this stress which in turn is having, what she believes, a negative impact on her marriage. What she is unaware of is that, long before her stress began, John embarked on an affair with her sister, bartender Cynthia Bishop, who she doesn't admire as being too "loud". John reconnects with a close friend from college named Graham Dalton, who, to John, appears to have lost his way in life in the years that they have not been in touch. Graham, via the method in which he deals with his emotional and sexual problems - which is also believes is being totally forthright to all concerned - has a profound effect on Cynthia, John and Ann, who in turn, especially Ann, have a profound effect on him.</p>
<p>A sexually repressed woman's husband is having an affair with her sister. The arrival of a visitor with a rather unusual fetish changes everything.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Once in a great while a motion picture comes along that surprises me. sex, lies, and videotape is one of them.  10-years had passed between the release of this picture and the time I saw it.  Then another 2-years before I decided to write about just how wonderful it is.  My only regret is that I didn't get to view it on the big screen.  My commentary on this film will be terse and the reason for this is I admired the film so much that I could go on-and-on about how really good it is.The first thing I noticed about the characters of Graham and Ann is that they are drawn to each other without realizing it.  During their first scene together, I could tell there was some attraction between them.  Ann is a sweet, innocent, very intelligent woman who is unfulfilled, yet doesn't realize her dilemma and is, therefore, in therapy.  At first I thought my instinct was wrong in this incidence, but came to realize how right I had been when Ann arose to go upstairs just to look at Graham sleeping. Neither of them have a clue as to what is transpiring between them, but their future together seems set and often that can be the best kind.Andie MacDowell is absolutely wonderful as Ann.  She owned that role.Graham is the character in search of closure to his past, which he regrets, probably due to his new-found moral code.  His attraction to Ann isn't evident to him because most men seeking a higher moral plane don't think of other men's wives in that regard.  Yet he openly discusses his impotence with her in a diner while the two of them are apartment-hunting for him. It's true that they are sharing secrets, but why something so personal a nature?  Ann tells Graham that she thinks sex is overrated and gives him her reasons why.  So, we have two comparative strangers, who had only met the day before, discussing things about their lives that they normally would keep to themselves and it is because they are comfortable with one-another and are still unaware of the deep-rooted attraction they share.James Spader is one of my favorite actors and turns in his usual outstanding performance.The character of Cynthia (Ann's sister) is the opposite of Ann.  She knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it, even though it's her sister's husband.  She doesn't want him on a permanent basis -- just when she needs him.  Sort of like a light switch that you can flip on and off.Good performance by Laura San Giacomo.The toughest character to write about is John.  Here is a guy on his way up the ladder of success who lets his hormones affect his job performance. He isn't entirely to blame, because he is in a loveless marriage and he doesn't realize the fact that he doesn't hold the key to Ann's heart.Good performance by Peter Gallagher.Mr. Soderbergh did an outstanding job of directing the four main characters to achieve the proper mix.  Without his superb direction this would have been just another film, but it is so much more than that.  I look forward to more of his writer-director creations, but sex, lies, and videotape will remain one of my all-time favorite films.</p>
