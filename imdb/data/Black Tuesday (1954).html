<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gritty low-budget prison film stars Edward G. Robinson as a death-row inmate about to be executed (black Tuesday) along with a convict (Peter Graves) who has $200,000 stashed away on the outside. But just as they are about to go to the chair, they pull an amazing prison break and escape.With a new gang that includes his moll (Jean Parker), Robinson plots to get the cash out of a safety deposit box. But things get complicated when Graves takes a bullet. With Parker posing as his secretary, Graves gets the money but his wound starts bleeding, tipping off the bank guard.Holed up in a warehouse and with several hostages, Robinson resists the cops' barrage of bullets and tear gas and threatens to kill the hostages one by one unless they are allowed to escape. But is there honor among thieves and murderers? Robinson is terrific as the murderous thug who will sacrifice anyone to get his way. Parker is also terrific as the hard-boiled moll (after decades of soft heroine roles). Graves is also good as the fellow con. Co-stars include Warren Stevens, Milburn Stone, Jack Kelly, Sylvia Findley, Russell Johnson, Vic Perrin, William Schallert, and Frank Ferguson.</p>
