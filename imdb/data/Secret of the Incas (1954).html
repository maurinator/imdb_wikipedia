<h1>Secret of the Incas (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Inca legend says the Inca Empire was destroyed by the gods when a gold and jeweled star burst was stolen from the Temple of the Sun centuries ago, and the ancient civilization will spring anew when the treasure is returned. The natives want it but so does Harry Steele, an American adventurer of slightly-shady ways who wants it for personal gain, as does his adversary, a grizzled old man even more into skulduggery than Steele. The latter teams up with Elena Antonescu, an Iron Curtain refugee fleeing from the MKVD. She can help him get a plane and he can help her escape Peru for the relative safety of Mexico.Is there a chance they will end up in a bickering love-hate relationship?... Is there a chance an American archaeologist, Dr. Stanley Moorehead, will come along as one corner of a romantic triangle?... Is there a chance that Yma Sumac (billed third on the posters and ads and special billed in the film), who can't act but can sing, will sing a few songs?... Is there a chance that these trite-sounding questions will develop into a film that is far from trite and vastly entertaining? Dang right, there is. Check it out.</p>
<p>An adventurer searchers for hidden treasure in the Peruvian jungles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I accidentally caught this movie, which ran in the middle of the night on television. I had fallen asleep and woke up after the movie started, but I was captivated enough to stay awake, mesmerized, through the rest of the movie. The voice of Yma Sumac, the costuming and the scenery, which includes Machu Picchu, Peru, can only be described as incredible and magnificent. For some reason, "someone" or "some ones" out there seem to be trying to bury both Yma Sumac and the movie. I can't buy it on video and the latest movie review books don't list Yma Sumac or the movie. I can only wonder as to why. Yma Sumac's vocal range is the widest of any singer yet. She glides to delicate, bird-like high ranges and then drops to throaty deep levels. Absolutely incredible!</p>
