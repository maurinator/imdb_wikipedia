<h1>Good Morning, Miss Dove (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Miss Dove is a strict disciplinary, plus a well respected teacher, who has inspired her students to individual greatness. One day during class, Miss Dove experiences great pain in her back, but continues with the class. After class she asks one of her students who is staying after class to get a doctor. Thomas, a doctor, and a former student of her's takes her to the hospital and hospitalizes her. While in the hospital her former students rally around her causing Miss Dove to reflect on her past.</p>
<p>In the small town of Liberty Hill, most of the current generation of children to young adults have been under the tutelage of the same Cedar Grove Elementary School Geography teacher, middle-aged spinster Miss Dove, who has taught there for fifteen years. Most in town, even those that are too old to have ever had Miss Dove as a teacher, treat her with respect to her face, but mock her behind her back because of her proper, no-nonsense and regimented "Miss Dove knows best" ways, and her strict, stern and somewhat cold attitude and demeanor. During one of her classes at a crucial time in the school year before state-wide proficiency exams, Miss Dove begins to suffer severe lower back pains, and numbness in her limbs. During her hospitalization awaiting the diagnosis, Miss Dove reflects back on her life, including: the reason she never married, despite being considered a catch for any man when a young woman, when she did receive a marriage proposal specifically from then aspiring archaeologist, Wilfred Pendleton III, who she loved; the reason she became a Geography teacher in Liberty Hill, despite having no plans to become such beforehand or plans to return to the town to live after her stint away at college; and a specific incident with her father's former business partner, John Porter, regarding a bank run. But she reflects most on her relationships with her past students, including: Tom Baker, who has ended up being her physician on this case in the absence of her own doctor; Virginia Baker, Tom's pregnant wife, who was going through emotional distress just one year earlier; Officer Bill Holloway, who grew up on the proverbial wrong side of the tracks; Billie Jean Green n√©e McVay, who came from an uncultured background and is now Miss Dove's day nurse at the hospital; Maurice Levine, a Polish-Jew who knew no English entering her class as an immigrant at age 11, but who went on to become a Broadway playwright; and Fred Makepeace, whose stealing of apples to give to her when he was a child was an early sign of becoming a convict as an adult. They, in turn, reflect on how Miss Dove has influenced their life. But as her life threatening diagnosis becomes known and news of it spreads, the residents of Liberty Hill demonstrate their true feelings for the terrible Miss Dove.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good Morning, Miss Dove is a property that I'm surprised Frank Capra didn't think to direct. It's entirely possible that Capra was a male chauvinist who only thought in terms of men who sacrifice like George Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. In many ways Jennifer Jones is the superior of Capra's George Bailey.Jennifer's crisis comes real early in the beginning, she's the daughter of a well bred and prominent family whose father has just died. She thinks she's come into it, but she finds she's inherited debts beyond belief because dad was borrowing and living well beyond his means. To keep his good name, she gives up the life she expected like George Bailey and in the process becomes the moral center of her small town.Her road was much harder than Jimmy Stewart's because Miss Dove never married, she instead devoted her life to teaching history and geography and never getting to see the faraway places with strange sounding names that she only read about. That song could have been written for her. George Bailey did have Mary Bailey and the kids, that was denied to Miss Dove.That's just one of the flashbacks in a film that has many. In fact the current story is the fact this rock of the community is undergoing a health crisis and is admitted to the hospital. As she deals with her health issues and the many people who wish her well, her mind reflects on just how much influence she's had on generations of kids passing through her class.She's a severe woman Ms. Dove, having denied herself a personal life. But she's also a kind and caring one and that comes through with all the people we see her interact with.Despite a fine cast of players, Jennifer Jones dominates this film in a fine portrayal of what is essentially an unglamorous part. It's the kind of role you might see someone like Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn do, but Jones is just fine in it.If you're not a fan of Jennifer Jones, you will be after seeing Good Morning, Miss Dove.</p>
