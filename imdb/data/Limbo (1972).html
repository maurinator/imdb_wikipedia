<h1>Limbo (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Deals with the problems facing a group of women married to men who are missing in Vietnam action. This is a slice-of-life film with each woman representing a different category: Nolan is the mother of four whose husband has been missing for years; Justice is a socialite who refuses to believe, despite strong evidence, that her husband has been killed; and Jackson gives a fine performance as a young woman, married only two weeks before her husband went off to war. He is missing in action, and she has met another man. This is one of the few films about Vietnam's effect on the home front and is certainly one of the only films made while the war was in progress. It also is a stand-out for the number of women involved in production. Silver wrote the story and collaborated on the screenplay. In addition, the film was edited and scored by women.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dull, early anti-Vietnam War drama set mostly on an air force base in Florida, where various women are waiting for their husbands to return from the horror. We're waiting too, but director, Robson (of "Von Ryan's Express" fame), is more at home with action than the interesting demands of Joan Micklin Silver's and James Bridges' script.</p>
