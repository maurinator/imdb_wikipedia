<h1>Sphinx (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Egyptologist Erica Baron finds more than she bargained for during her long-planned trip to The Land of the Pharoahs - murder, theft, betrayal, love, and a mummy's curse!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sphinx isn't the greatest movie about Egypt, but it is somewhat entertaining. I'd probably buy it if it came out on DVD, but it wouldn't be my first choice. It's worth it to watch Leslie Ann Down, she's not the smartest Egyptologist, but she's still very easy on the eyes.</p>
