<h1>Droopy (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Don't be fooled by the title - Droopy looks like Droopy, but he's actually jazzman John Pettibone, with his performing flea combo, and the film shows how it came into being.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Need a lift? Watch this cartoon. You'll feel a lot better.This a different kind of Droopy cartoon, right from the opening scene. This is the "true story" of John Pettybone, a jazz player who rose from the junkyard to the Hollywood Bowl. Droopy plays Mr. Pettybone. We get a narrator, the kind I used to hear in film noirs or in short features, explaining the story for us, or at least the background information.Everywhere Droopy plays his recording - a recording of his Dixieland music - he, and the disc, get thrown out. He runs the gamut from ice cream trucks, jukeboxes, organ grinders, merry-go-rounds, you name it. Nobody wants to hear his jazzy record.When all seems lost, our musical friend finds a real Dixieland band at the local circus: "The Musical Fleas, featuring Pee Wee Runt and his All-Flea Dixieland Band.You have to love the creativity of these writers!What happens after this is even wilder. This is one of the funnier, most original and great- looking (colors are fantastic) and great-sounding cartoons I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The Dixieland music will have your feet jumping: guaranteed.If you get the opportunity, see this on the Droopy DVD package with the restored picture. It's fantastic.</p>
