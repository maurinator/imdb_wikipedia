<h1>Road to Bali (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Having to leave Melbourne in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals, two song-and-dance men sign on for work as divers. This takes them to an idyllic island on the way to Bali where they vie with each other for the favours of Princess Lala. The hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels which arouses the less romantic interest of some shady locals.</p>
<p>Two unemployed show-biz pals accept treasure-diving work in Bali for a local princess and they find treasure,love and trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like all of the Hope and Crosby road pictures even if they were kind of silly.  I grew up with them; even saw Hope on stage at the Palace Theater in Cleveland, Ohio in the old vaudeville days (they also had a picture show). Anyhow, as simple as they were, they were funny in their own way, and I loved Crosby singing, and Dorothy Lamour's vocaling in amour!  Saw The Road to Bali on the tube AMC for the umpteenth time, and still enjoyed it; as usual the music is great, and the boys really didn't know how to end it! 6/10</p>
