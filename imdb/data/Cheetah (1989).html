<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Cheetah" is a treasure of a family film.  It is very memorable, and enjoyable throughout.  The acting is good, as the young cast of stars shine. The scenery is amazing, and the premise is a unique, original idea.  I'm surprised this film hasn't received more attention, as it is truly one of the greatest family films ever.  Disney does a superb job here with "Cheetah"...people of all ages will enjoy this film.</p>
