<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anthony Hopkins has a truly magnificent range as an actor. In 'The Dawning' he plays a member of the Irish landed-gentry whose destiny has become inextricably connected to the independence of all Ireland from British Rule, circa. 1920. This commitment sees him on the run from the British after perpetrating numerous acts of violence to achieve this end and returning to his old stamping grounds; perhaps for reasons of nostalgia, perhaps to seek his final resting place. Rebecca Pidgeon gives a sensitive portrayal of an orphan girl about to enter womanhood who is searching for an identity from somewhere in a past obscured by lack of information from those responsible for her upbringing. That she should stumble upon Anthony Hopkins in hiding seems inevitable and that their relationship should throw up unresolved ambiguities is of course central to the narrative. The acting is very good and the Irish locations absolutely stunning. But those looking for some historical clarification of the times are bound to be disappointed. This is a film of acute characterizations, and the incidents and events depicted in the film are merely props to support the interaction between Hopkins and Pidgeon. It's also a film with almost no Irish actors in the cast and to my mind this has rendered it a touch colorless and lacking authenticity. But it's a very watchable film and I've given it 7 out of 10.</p>
