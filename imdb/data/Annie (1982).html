<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought that this movie was a real spirit-lifter. It is a movie that I hope everyone who watches it has a change of attitude towards orphans and homeless children and adults. Sometimes I find myself turning my back on homeless people. Although I am ashamed to admit it, I do hope that others will look beyond money and appearance and see what really matters. This movie, once again, was wonderful. I hope that you keep up all of the good work and keep producing and directing movies such as this one. Enjoy all of your comments and all of your hard earned credit that you are receiving and take the time to really preview all of your scripts and watch the movie several times to praise all of your good work. Thank you very much and I will be watching the movies that you produce no matter how long, or short, they might be.</p>
