<h1>The Jimmy Show (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jimmy O'Brien works in the stockroom of a grocery store, where he is reminded of his powerlessness by his boss. Only his love for his wife offers him comfort, but their obligations to his invalid grandmother and a new baby stifle their dreams. It is not until open-mike night at the local comedy club that he allows himself to do what he needs to do: run off at the mouth.</p>
<p>A failed New Jersey inventor embarks on a career as a standup comic, turns to drink, and labors to keep his family together.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I kept waiting around for something  redeeming to happen - it doesn't. As  far as I could see, this was a totally pointless movie about a loser who never learns anything about himself. He is a  self centered, self pitying person who  never "gets it" -  i.e., he is the problem. It makes me wonder Who would put up money to make a movie like this? This was so bad!!!</p>
