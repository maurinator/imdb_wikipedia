<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great 80's verit√© (like Miami Vice). A low-budget but likeable caper movie.A wealthy industrialist hires six thieves to steal a valuable relic from the fictional country of San Lucas just before the annual parade celebrating the relic. He gets double crossed by his own team of thieves, most notably Charles Rocket (SNL, Earth Girls Are Easy). Carey Lowell (Law & Order, Sleepless in Seattle), the baddest Bond Girl. is an innocent bystander dragged into the plot.Keep an eye out for Courteney Cox at the beginning of the movie.</p>
