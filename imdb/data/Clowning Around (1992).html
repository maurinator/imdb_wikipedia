<h1>Clowning Around (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Follows a boy who realizes there is more to being a clown, than just clowning around.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a nice, enjoyable film. But I'll admit that the only reason I've seen it is because my mum has a cameo role as the lady who walks next to the mean lady who takes the boy when he is young.The performances are strong in this film, but I'm sure it didn't have to be as long as it was. The French circus finale' isn't bad at all, but along the way, I'm sure children may get a bit bored. Although for a younger audience, and older audience may take it in a little better.Anyway it's worth a watch. I only ever saw parts of Clowning Around 2.</p>
