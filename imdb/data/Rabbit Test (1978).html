<h1>Rabbit Test (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lionel's life turns around after a one-night stand on top of a pinball table... he becomes the world's first pregnant man!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie does boast quite a good cast; unfortunately it's not a good movie.  If you watch this, you will see such exotica as: Joan Rivers as a clumsy and foul-mouthed nurse ("Screw Florence Nightingale!  What did she know?"); Murray Matheson as a lecherous quack; Roddy McDowall as a gynecologist (complete with a bandaged index finger); George Gobel as U.S. President Lee Ron Bob suffering from serious prostate trouble; Jimmie (dynoMITE!) Walker as a ventriloquist and nudie native; Billy Barty as his dummy; Peter Marshall as a game show host (wow, what a stretch!!!); Rosey Grier as a greedy taxi driver; Tom Poston as a smart-aleck minister; Alex Rocco as a gung-ho army sergeant (don't you love the smell of turkey in the morning?); and Sheree North as a lusty mystery woman.  Add in mailed poultry, a band of gypsies, nutty foreigners who make a beeline for the door at the sound of "IMMIGRATION!!!", disparaging remarks about Helen Keller, inflatable rubber women (shades of Bud Bundy on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN!) and bad taste jokes about fat people, and you've got all the key ingredients for a Razzie-Award nominee.  If you watch this film, don't expect too much and you might have a good time.</p>
