<h1>Titus (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>War begets revenge. Victorious general, Titus Andronicus, returns to Rome with hostages: Tamora queen of the Goths and her sons. He orders the eldest hewn to appease the Roman dead. He declines the proffered emperor's crown, nominating Saturninus, the last ruler's venal elder son. Saturninus, to spite his brother Bassianus, demands the hand of Lavinia, Titus's daughter. When Bassianus, Lavinia, and Titus's sons flee in protest, Titus stands against them and slays one of his own. Saturninus marries the honey-tongued Tamora, who vows vengeance against Titus. The ensuing maelstrom serves up tongues, hands, rape, adultery, racism, and Goth-meat pie. There's irony in which two sons survive.</p>
<p>Titus returns victorious from war, only to plant the seeds of future turmoil for himself and his family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this movie a lot. Shakespeare is the only profound person I've ever come across and this movie did him justice.If you like Shakespeare and aren't hung up on the need of Shakespeare plays / movies to use English accents, then watch this movie. Brilliant acting, brilliant production. This isn't the typical low budget Shakespeare movie that hurts the eyes. It's an unsettling movie which is good because it's an unsettling play. The movie did a good job of expressing the feeling that is hidden within the text.Anthony Hopkins is an amazing actor, backed up by other actors who are almost as impressive.</p>
