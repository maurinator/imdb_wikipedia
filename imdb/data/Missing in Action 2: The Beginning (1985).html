<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one that will probably be torn to shreds critically by snobby europeans, and wannabe intellectual movie-goers who just cant get enough of their bullet time, and 200 million dollar epics.This is actually the prequel to the first Missing In Action movie.It tells the story of a forgotten group of P.O.W.'s who are being brutalised by an overbearing colonel who enjoys watching the vet's suffer.As the prisoners numbers dwindle, one James Braddock decides to take charge of the dire situation before its all too late.From the opening to the fiery, action packed finale this film boasts raw combat and even dares to throw in some emotion.I actually truly cared for the characters as I wanted to see them survive and extract revenge upon their communist enslavers.Truly strange times we live in when one cannot be proud to be an American.I will always be proud and you can go back to your dull German expressionist films.Chuck Norris is the man.I love 80's action!</p>
