<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is one of the best I have seen in a very long time! With the excellence of actors such as; John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, and Denzel Washington, how could this movie go wrong? All three of these actors give the best performance I have seen from them. The story line is fast-paced and exciting, with enough twists and turns that even the most seasoned movie-goer will be surprised at what will come next. I was awed by the imaginative way that the catch phrase, "Time is on my side" was used. Anytime I hear it now, I remember that movie. I believe, if it can make a moviegoer remember it like that, it is a great movie! I am anxiously awaiting the sequel!</p>
