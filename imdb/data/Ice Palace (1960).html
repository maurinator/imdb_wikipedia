<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the great movies ever made. I really would love to own it on DVD. I have it on VHS, but the color is fading. Do you know when it will come out on DVD. I recommend this movie to all ages.Anyone who is interested in the history and stories of Alaska will enjoy the story. The actors are Robert Ryan, who is great, Richard Burton, who is always very good, and Carolyn Jones and Marther Hyer who portray their parts perfectly. You are in for a real treat, so grab your popcorn, something to drink, set back and enjoy a great movie, full of entertainment and good acting. To bad that Hollywood does not put out this kind of movies anymore. An era has pasted and that is too bad.</p>
