<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Middle-aged banker Arthur Hamilton is given the opportunity to start a completely new life when he receives calls from his old friend Charlie. The only problem is that Charlie is supposed to be dead. Hamilton is eventually introduced to a firm that will fake his death and create an entirely new look and life for him. After undergoing physical reconstruction surgery and months of training and psychotherapy, Hamilton returns to the world in the form of artist Tony Wilson. He has a nice house in Malibu and a manservant, a company employee who is there to assist him with his adjustment. He finds that the life he had hoped for isn't quite what he expected and asks the company to go through the process with surprising results.</p>
<p>What if someone offered you the chance to begin again, with a new life that was organized to be exactly what you wanted it to be? That's what the organization offers some wealthy people. They find a life that is what their clients would have wanted, artist, writer, politician, kill the person who is to be replaced and surgically alter their clients to take their places. We follow a new client from first contact, through his staged death, to surgery, recovery and replacement. Of course thats when things become complicated.</p>
<p>Arthur Hamilton is a middle aged New York banker living in Scarsdale. He's married with a grown daughter he rarely sees anymore. He is generally disengaged from everything in his life. Based on a series of telephone calls he receives from his supposedly deceased friend Charlie Evans, Arthur is drawn into a company that provides him with a second chance in life. Initially resisting this opportunity, 'they' convince him that he has little to live for in his current life, which includes a past indiscretion, albeit one unintentional on his part. His 'rebirth' will include a cadaver to replace his current body after his death, enough money for his current family to live comfortably after his departure, enough money for his new start in life, a surgical make-over of his current self, and a new identity based on his subconscious desires. This new identity is as a Malibu based painter christened Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson. To assist him in this transition to Tony Wilson, the company provides him with a counselor of sorts, acting as a live-in housekeeper named John, who attends to whatever Tony requires emotionally to make the transition successfully. Even with John's help, Tony is finding it difficult to make the transition, despite or perhaps in spite of meeting a woman named Nora Marcus, with whom he falls in love. He has to discover where he went wrong in his life as Arthur Hamilton and where he went wrong in his transition to Tony Wilson before he can find out where he wants to go and how to achieve getting there. But will the company help him achieve what he wants?</p>
<p>In Scarsdale, the bored banker Arthur Hamilton is contacted by his former friend Charlie Evans that supposedly died several years ago giving information about a secret organization that offers for US$ 30,000.00 a second chance in life to wealthy people. He visits the company and they explain that they use a cadaver with the same characteristics to stage the death of the client and give a new identity after plastic surgeries with new documents. The reborn Arthur is the painter Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson that lives in California with his butler John that helps him in the transition. Tony meets the lonely Nora Marcus on the beach and they have a love affair. But sooner Tony realizes that his fake world does not give satisfaction to him and he returns to the company requesting another life. But the rules are not so easy to be changed.</p>
<p>There is a very secret organization that offers wealthy people a second chance at life; the customer picks out someone they want to be and the organization surgically alters the customer to look like the intended person, stages the customer's death, gets rid of the intended person and the customer has a new life. There's only one thing they didn't count on.....</p>
<p>An unhappy middle-aged banker agrees to a procedure that will fake his death and give him a completely new look and identity - one that comes with its own price.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is so chilling & depressing to sit thru, because, from the first frame to the last, it is totally devoid of any life and human spirit. Anderson is, from the beginning, a walking dead man with no values, no real love, no meaning to his life, and he takes that with him into his "rebirth." Only this is no spiritual rebirth. All poor Anderson can do now is party and get drunk in order to escape from this new reality, which is even more soulless than his original one. Character is destiny. That's why the "company" has so many failures. Even the Old Man can't see this. He thinks the failures are due to "mistakes." It often gets categorized as a thriller, but to me it's a tragedy and a very profound one at that. It's about the tragic results of life lived without meaning, without real values, without love, without spirit. Like all real tragedy, SECONDS is cathartic. I had to go for a long walk after I saw this one. Its depiction of spiritual emptiness, though depressing to sit through, is ultimately rewarding.</p>
