<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>something weird video strikes again,this is one of those rare nudie cutie movies from the 60's.with monsters that is.its crazy and fun as an alien visits Dr. breed loves castle lab,thats full of half naked cuties.featuring a blonde go go dancer;Claudia banks who looks like jenny McCarthy.but all the girls in this 1964 comedy are very pretty and all natural.no implants here.there's cameos by Frankensteins monster, the mummy and even Dracula.there's nudity(nothing below the waist)this was produced by the always profitable harry novak.on the DVD from something weird video is another nudie cutie monster spoof;the house on bare mountain.but kiss me quick is one of those goofy movies you'll want to check out.my favorite in this film is Claudia banks.the DVD has tons of extras.something weird video strikes again,7 out of 10 check it out.</p>
