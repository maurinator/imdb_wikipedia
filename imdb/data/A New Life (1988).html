<h1>A New Life (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After a middle-aged couple divorces, they must each enter the frightening but funny world of blind dates and new relationships.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is what I call a warm fuzzy. It shows a mix of people living this thing called life in a haphazard and enjoyable way. The combo of Alda and Linden had me laughing out of my chair. They remind me of so many people we all know. Ann Margaret is a knockout and Veronica Hamel brings hill street to medicine. This is MY favorite Alda movie and made me respect him as an actor who can play somebody other than Hawkeye. In my humble opinion this was Linden's best work. to use a quote from elsewhere "Alda's purpose is to show us fairly typical people going through fairly typical things. They live, we watch. On that voyeuristic level, the movie works." Please powers that be release this on DVD or show it on HBO high def .SUMMARY- NOT A CLASSIC JUST A WARM FUZZY FEEL GOOD.</p>
