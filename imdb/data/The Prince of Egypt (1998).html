<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best animated movie of all time. It's not every day that they make a animated movie about a story of the bible. The writers, and animators were very accurate about telling the story. As a Christian I like it when they make movies about the bible. The animation, and music was truly awesome. I like everything about this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Children will love this movie. I'll tell you now you wont be disappointed. I really wasn't.</p>
