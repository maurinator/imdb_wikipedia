<h1>Lake Placid (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>What happens when a man-eating crocodile begins picking off tourists in beautiful Lake Placid? What if the crocodile wants to make it his home?</p>
<p>Lake Placid - Well it would be, but; "somebody said that name was taken." At least according to the local Sheriff. When a man is eaten alive by an unknown creature, the local Game Warden (Pullman) teams up with a paleontologist (Fonda) from New York to find the beast. Add to the mix an eccentric philanthropist with a penchant for "Crocs" (Platt), and here we go! This quiet, remote lake is suddenly the focus of an intense search for a crocodile with a taste for live animals...and people!</p>
<p>Three people attempt to stop a gigantic crocodile, who is terrorizing residents in Black Lake, Maine.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My wife told me to get this movie.  I told her it got terrible, terrible reviews.  Well, we got it, I wound up watching it and enjoying it much more than I thought I would.  More a comedy than a horror movie, it was pretty stupid, knew it was, and treated itself accordingly.  Loved Brendan Gleeson as the sheriff, and Betty White's part, though small, was wonderfully eccentric.</p>
