<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wonderful performances, almost real. Beautiful black and white cinematography. It shows the real love of a mother, driving her to situations she doesn't want, to make her son happy. Melodramatic story that will make you weep. And will also make you watch every single italian film done in the 60's.</p>
