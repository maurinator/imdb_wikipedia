<h1>House of Cards (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Ruth Matthews's husband is killed in a fall at an archaeological dig, her daughter Sally handles her father's death in a very odd manner. As Sally's condition worsens, Ruth takes her to see Jake, an expert in childhood autism. Jake attempts to bring Sally out of her mental disarray through traditional therapy methods, but Ruth takes a different route. She risks her own sanity by attempting to enter her daughter's mind and make sense of the seemingly bizarre things that Sally does, including building a wondrous house of cards.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Movies about mental disorders can go either way. On one end you have 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' a stellar example of filmmaking. On the other there are made-for-TV movies dealing with this issue. Some rise above the others, which are often too schmaltzy and/or shallow. Though no match for the former, this mostly forgotten film is far above the latter. An unconventional look at a child who has withdrawn and the people who try to help her. Not a masterpiece, but a solid viewing experience.Pros: Very well acted. Touching story. Beautifully scored. Stunning cinematography and scenery. Strong feature debut for Michael Lessac. Moves at a good pace. Has a cool, surreal kind of atmosphere. A few really standout moments, such as the baseball scene.Cons: Characters could have used more fleshing out. Narrative is a bit convoluted.Final thoughts: 'House of Cards' is one of those films that came and went. It's too bad because it's quite an interesting film. It may not be the deepest of character studies, but it's a very heartfelt and engaging little movie. It helps that it tackles a big issue like mental illness with such sensitivity.My rating: 4/5</p>
