<h1>Half Angel (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nora Gilpin is a demure nurse, who has just become engaged to her long-time beau, Tim. She is also secretly fighting her attraction to attorney, John Raymond, whom she insists she dislikes. However, at night, she sleepwalks and adopts a different --and sexier-- personality. Nora then seeks out John and expresses her true feelings for him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Misshapen piece of fluff, a capricious bit of harmless whimsy that may go down easier at three in the morning when one is apt to be less demanding. Loretta Young is a starchy, spinsterish nurse, about to marry the cloddish man she's been putting off for five years, when suddenly her repressed desire to flirt with a strictly-business attorney takes over her body while she's sleepwalking, leading to a series of romantic confusions. Robert Riskin is responsible for the script, which he adapted from a story by George Carleton Brown; both men are strictly behind-the-times in terms of a saucy bedroom comedy (although Young is certainly attractive dressed in a very sheer negligee!). Joseph Cotten looks rather incredulous at being caught in such a juvenile scenario, and the tone of the picture is wobbly right from the start. Colorful supporting players (Jim Backus, Irene Ryan, and the always-reliable Cecil Kellaway) add some sparkle, however the movie hinges on Young's performance and she's much more annoying than seductive. ** from ****</p>
