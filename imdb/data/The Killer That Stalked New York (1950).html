<h1>The Killer That Stalked New York (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sheila Bennett returns to New York from Cuba, carrying $40,000 worth of smuggled diamonds...and smallpox, which could start a devastating epidemic in the unprotected city. Treasury agent Johnson loses her but keeps doggedly on the trail; while Public Health doctor Wood searches in vain for the unknown person spreading the deadly disease far and wide. Meanwhile, the increasingly ill Sheila is only concerned with her faithless husband Matt, who plans to abscond with the diamonds...</p>
<p>Sheila Bennett smuggles some diamonds, from Cuba, through the port of New York City but is unaware she is also bringing in a smallpox virus. Doctor can not diagnose the spreading disease quickly enough so by the time they discover what they are looking for, Sheila is free-spreading the virus through the city. While both the police department and the city-health department are looking for her, as a smuggler and virus-carrier, she is looking for her double-crossing husband.</p>
<p>Police seek a smuggler while doctors, unaware she's the same person, desperately comb unprotected New York for a smallpox carrier.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I caught this movie late at night on the Encore Mystery Channel. There was never a dull moment. The plot was plausible, the acting very good, and the photography great! I find it "amazing" how the scripts and dialogues were so often more intelligible back in the "good old days" of movies. There was not the incessant obscene and crude language that pervades most of today's films. The pacing was right on and the ending suspenseful. I only wish I could purchase it. Oh, by the way, am I the only one bored by the never ending credits? They seem almost as long as the movie. Does anyone, besides mommy or daddy, really care who the movie's caterer or grip was? With the above out of my system, if you get the chance, see this flick. It is a winner.</p>
