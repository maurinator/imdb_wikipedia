<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Muppet Treasure Island is a funny spoof of the classic story. Tim Curry stands out, and plays the part of Long John Silver very well. Using the Muppets to play the parts of the classic characters makes it all the more fun. Muppet Treasure Island is by far not the best Muppet film ever, but it is good and enjoyable.</p>
