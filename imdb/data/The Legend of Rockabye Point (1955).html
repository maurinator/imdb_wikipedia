<h1>The Legend of Rockabye Point (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Antarctic, a fishing boat passes an iceberg where we hear the lullaby "Rockabye Baby" being sung. The captain explains how, 20 years ago, a polar bear was trying to steal fish from his ship. Alas, Chilly Willy the penguin also had his eyes on the fish. A very mean bulldog was sleeping in front of the fish, and Willy made sure the polar bear kept waking it up. Every time, the bear quickly sang a verse of "Rockabye Baby" and the dog would fall asleep again. Finally, the two of them ended up stranded atop a tall iceberg, where we see that they're still going at it, with bushy gray beards now.</p>
<p>The old fishing boat captain tells the story of Chilly Willy, a singing polar bear and a bulldog who quickly falls asleep when he hears a lullaby.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After Tex Avery was let go from M-G-M, rather than let his talents as a animation director/animation supervisor (take your choice)go down the tubes by retiring,he went to work for Walter Lanz (Woody Woodpecker,Andy Panda,etc.)at Universal. He managed to produce the usual high quality output of funny,funny material. This is just another shining example. This is a Chilly Willy episode,where Chilly & a rather deranged looking polar bear are both eyeballing a ship filled to the nine's with fresh fish. The only thing keeping both from scoring a booty of fish is a rather scary looking bulldog,guarding the ship from theft. What results is a series of gags where the bear trying to pilfer the fish,with Chilly waking the enraged dog,who bites the bear on the ass,where the bear has to sing 'Rock A Bye Baby', over and over again. This is another one of those laugh until you're sick to your stomach shorts (and I wouldn't want it any other way). It's a damned pity that these animated shorts have become neglected over the years. Perhaps,Cartoon Network's off shoot station, Boomerang will one day get the broadcasting rights to air this stuff from Universal.</p>
