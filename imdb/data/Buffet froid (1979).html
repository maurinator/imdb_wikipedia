<h1>Buffet froid (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Black comedy about solitude and the dehumanization of the modern world, through the adventures of three men. First introduced is Alphonse Tram, an unemployed young man. His only neighbour is the police chief-inspector Morvandieu. Then a third man appears: he is Alphonse's wife's murderer... Bizarre and unreal.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A monument of dark humour, Buffet Froid relies more on what is not said rather than the obvious slapstick humour we're being fed on extensively these days. I showed it to many people and a lot of them admitted they did not understand because it was not "anchored in reality" - to which I answered that not everything is supposed to be. This is superior quality surrealism, and the trio Depardieu-Blier-Carmet works wonders. RENT IT !</p>
