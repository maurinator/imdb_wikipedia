<h1>The Monitors (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Unusual sci-fi invasion film, with a black-comedy twist: The Earth is taken over by The Monitors, aliens who run it like hall monitors in a 1950's high school, with overtones of Big Brother. The film follows the progress of the human underground rebellion. The twist is that as the film goes on, the audience's sympathies shift to the aliens, who are basically benevolent. When the humans manage to oust them, it's back to corruption and bribery by the usual suspects.</p>
<p>Earthlings chafe at the peace established by a benevolent alien race and set about to rebel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember watching this movie on late nite TV many times as a child. Although a bit slow it is a good movie and worth watching.  The Monitors are a group of aliens which inhabit Earth and take responsibility as a sort of police force, bringing peace to the planet as well as technological and medical advancements.  Although the Monitors are truly benign, an underground movement does not want the planet to be controlled by outsiders.The TV series Earth Final Conflict seems suspiciously  similar. The social statements are similar to those found in Metropolis, 1984, and Planet of the Apes, and Colossus: The Forbin Project, to name a few.  The commentary questions government intervention in affairs domestic as well as foreign, and seems to question whether peace is better than the freedom of self-governance, and if "peace" can be enforced.  It is also one of the few cold war science fiction movies that does not focus on the USSR by proxy.</p>
