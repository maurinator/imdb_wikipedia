<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Regular Horror/Thriller that has some decent scenes for the Horror fans. First, it deals with the devil and possession after death. Lou Diamond Phillips is a man tormented by his past and his belief in God is in predicament. He thinks his father didn't deserve to die. In fact, that event causes a series of situations like his mother turning crazy. Could he find the serial killer he is after to? Could he solve the mystery of the First Power?Watch it and find it. Not a good Horror flick but sure it's entertaining. My only beef is that it doesn't have a creepy atmosphere or a dark setting; the plot asks for it! Also, there's a point where it's necessary to have some Horror related scenes but the movie focuses more on drama and thriller.Lou Diamond Philips' performance is the best thing about the movie. Mrs. Griffith also delivers a nice performance and helps a lot that she's very beautiful and charming.Delivers some chilling scenes but relies on the dramatic side more. Be warned you could be bored if you are looking for a straight Horror movie. Still it has a creepy vibe and very well done plot. Give it a chance.</p>
