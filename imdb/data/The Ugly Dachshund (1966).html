<h1>The Ugly Dachshund (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fran Garrison's all in a tizzy because her prize Dachshund, Danke, is having pups, and she has hopes of one of the pups becoming a champion. But at the vet's, her husband Mark is talked into letting Danke wet nurse a Great Dane pup that's been abandoned by his mother. And Mark wants to keep the Great Dane. But Brutus has this problem: he thinks he's a dachshund and he's too big to be a lapdog. But when Fran ridicules Brutus one too many times, Jim's got a plan to prove to everyone (and Fran) that a great Dane can be far more than just an ugly dachshund.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Disney comedy stars Dean Jones and Suzanne Pleshette as a happily married couple who have dog issues. Pleshette is the proud owner of a pregnant dachshund who has to make a mad dash to the veterinarian to give birth which costs Jones a bunch of moving violations.But while at the veterinarian's, Charlie Ruggles after delivering Suzanne's three dachshund pups persuades Jones to take in a Great Dane pup because the mother rejected it from her litter. Jones not too reluctantly agreed as he's always wanted a big man size dog.Of course when Suzanne finds out she reluctantly agrees, but not for long as the puppy grows up big and bumptious. The bulk of the film is taken up with the big bumptious Great Dane making a wreck of their lives. Poor dog whose named Brutus gets blamed for everything even when it isn't his fault. But he proves himself a winner at the end, literally.Jones and Pleshette are a nice couple and the chemistry is good. One thing I took exception to is the sequence where the big dog actually trees a police officer. I mean really, we all know that cop Kelly Thordsen in real life would have just shot the dog. There's been enough stories out there about trigger happy cops to know that's the case. But not in the Magic Kingdom.It's an innocuous Disney comedy that other than that scene holds up well as family entertainment.</p>
