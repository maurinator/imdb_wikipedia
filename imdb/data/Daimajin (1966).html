<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alright, there isn't anything too deep about this film. We essentially have a period piece riding the coat tails of the Godzilla (Gojira) phenomenon sweeping Japan's cinema at the time. I don't have too much to add to the other reviews, other than I hadn't seen this movie since Bob Wilkins was hosting Creature Features in Sacramento. It's been that long. Okay, not entirely, I did catch snippets here and there over the years on daytime TV, but the thing hardly ever aired.So, through the magic of Amazon streaming, I've now seen the movie in its entirety. What to say.It's fun for what it is. We pretty much have here some old folklore brought to life via Japanese monster film making styles, including the use of "suitmation" (Japanese industry slang for a guy in a rubber monster suit running around a miniature set). And, believe it or not, as far as the effects go, this film actually delivered and did a bang up job by presenting to the viewer a couple of shots that should convince the most jaded eye that a large creature was attacking medieval Japan. Some of the shots weren't so convincing, but there were a handful where I found myself wondering; "Did they really build that thing?"Ah well. The movie is more B-movie material than anything else, but it has its moments here and there. If you're a classic monster film aficionado, or are really into the Kaiju or historical genres, then give Daimajin a chance.It's worth a night's rental for the monster fan in all of us. Check it out.</p>
