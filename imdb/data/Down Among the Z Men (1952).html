<h1>Down Among the Z Men (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Professor Pure Heart absentmindedly loses the top secret formula in Harry Jones' Grocery Shop. "Bats of the Yard", as Harry calls himself, finds it and proudly attempts to return it to the Professor.</p>
<p>The mad professor loses his top secret formula and Harry Secombe finds it. While trying to return it, Harry is mistakenly enlisted in the new 'Z' reservists. International crooks, trying to find the formula, also enlist in the 'Z' men.</p>
<p>Harry follows the Professor to Warwell Atomic Research Camp where he meets the commander, who, mistaking him for one of the new "Z" reservists, makes him fall in and Harry is in the Army. Unbeknownst to all, international crooks are trying to steal the formula and have also enlisted in the "Z" men.</p>
<p>The cast of the popular radio program "The Goon Show" perform some of their favourite routines.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although poor by today's standards it should be noted that this movie is the first time all the major characters of the Goon Show had worked together on screen. They had not yet worked out which routines worked well in radio but not in a movie. They would do better in subsequent efforts. It helps if the viewer knows something of the Goon Show radio series and, perhaps, has seen the TV series too. Making the transition from a radio program, where the listener's imagination supplies the scenery, to a television or film style is always difficult. The film has its moments, especially the chorus girl's dance routines and a flash-of-brilliance preview of Peter Seller's exceptional talent as he makes fun of an American general and his Staff Seargent under siege by the Germans. It's also apparent why Michael Bentine did not last long as a star although Jerry Lewis must have used this as a training film.</p>
