<h1>The McConnell Story (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mac's plans to settle down and raise a family are upset by the Korean War. He goes as a fighter pilot and returns a hero, the first triple ace of the war. His neighbors have built a home for Mac and his devoted wife and their three children. Now he has an offer to test pilot new Sabre Jets. His wife is uneasy but knows she cannot ground her man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You've seen it before, the wife biting her nails as her man takes to the skies.This film is almost as clich√© as a script where the pilot loses his nerve and can't fly for awhile. Alan Ladd is still short and still takes little choppy steps when he walks, like he's a 5-year old who wants his ball or else he's gonna tell Mom.Fortunately, no milk crates can be seen here (Ladd use to have to stand on milk crates when he did a scene with a woman because he was such a shrimp). However, he still looks like a dwarf even when he's flying and the camera can't hide that.June Allyson is cute, but James Whitmore probably gives the best performance. OK for fans of these types of movies.</p>
