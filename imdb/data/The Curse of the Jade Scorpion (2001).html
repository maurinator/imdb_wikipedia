<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Acting is great and the dialog smart and fresh. Well have you rolling in the isles. All the difference a bigger budget can do for Woody. The 1940's is caught in all it's splendor, with color and superb taste of decor. This is just a good evening of entertainment without all the special effects, and refreshing to see a role that a first rate actress can get her teeth into. Woody should be congratulated for taken second spot for Helen Hunt to shine in all her Glory. One of the best films this season in a run of death pan,juvenile comedies,without talent and very little acting. Makes you want the star system to be put back in place.</p>
