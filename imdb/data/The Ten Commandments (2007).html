<h1>The Ten Commandments (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this animated adaptation of the Bible story Moses hears the voice of God from a burning bush, which inspires him to confront Egypt's pharaoh and demand freedom for the Israelite slaves. The pharaoh agrees after a series of horrific plagues, and Moses leads the Israelites through the parted Red Sea into the harsh freedom of the desert. There he ascends Mount Sinai and returns with the Ten Commandments.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First this is a biblical story based on the Old Testament. Next, this story is not the most accurate I've seen. It sticks closely to the book, but there's been plenty that's been changed or left out. Let's say it contains bits and pieces of accuracy, but so do both of C.B. De Mille's versions and Prince of Egypt, all of which are also pretty accurate in spots. Last, this film borrows characters and scenes from the above films as well. The acting is not the best, (neither is the animation) but I sat through it (took me two tries but my curiosity got the better of me)Worth watching if curious, but i would stick to De Mille's versions (both the 23 and 56 films) and Prince of Egypt for great animation and music.</p>
