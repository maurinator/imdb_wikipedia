<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having recently purchased this movie on DVD and viewed it again, I feel compelled to amend my prior comments.  On the most recent viewing, I watched the movie much more carefully than on prior viewings, and can now see the motivations of the character(s) more clearly, and how the 'situation' portrayed in the film spiralled out of control (click on my username to read my prior review for "At Close Range," in which I questioned the actions of the villain).  On more careful viewing, the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  I want to revise my prior comment -- this is a superb film, and I've voted again and now give this film 9/10.  If you haven't seen it, now's a great chance.  Great acting by *everyone*, especially Sean Penn and Christopher Walken (this is one of Walken's best parts ever).The DVD version of the film just came out (I had it on preorder and received it yesterday), and I have to say how impressed I am with the transfer.  Absolutely superlative, clear picture quality, although I can't evaluate the sound because I have only stereo speakers, no dolby surround.  But the video transfer itself is one of the best I've seen for a movie this old, looking like the film might just have been made six months ago.  It appears that quite a bit of work went into restoration.  If you have a DVD player, you owe it to yourself to get this film on DVD, although the only 'special feature' is the original theatrical trailer.  The film is offered in both widescreen and pan-and-scan formats (two-sided single-layer).Revised Review: 9/10</p>
