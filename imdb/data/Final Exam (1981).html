<h1>Final Exam (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a small college in North Carolina, only a select few students are left to take mid terms. But, when a killer strikes, it could be everyone's final exam.</p>
<p>A psycho killer shows up on college campus to slash up pretty co-eds and dumb jocks.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on the comments I looked at for FINAL EXAM, it appears that this once forgotten film may be getting a rebirth after nearly 18 years, thanks to SCREAM, BUFFY, and the return of the slasher-horror genre. FINAL EXAM does have some suspenseful chilling moments, including the finale where the girl meets the psycho atop the campus tower, plus a couple of gruesome mutilations. The best thought I had in viewing this one was that it's a simple basic average movie, as there was nothing new or groundbreaking. But with slasher's comeback, it may be worth checking out. Another movie I'd recommend is MADMAN, which is far more original and horrifying than FINAL EXAM, and because it has a special purpose in mind.</p>
