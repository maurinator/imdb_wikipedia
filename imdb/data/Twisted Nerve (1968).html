<h1>Twisted Nerve (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Martin is a troubled young man. With a mother who insists on treating him like a child, a stepfather who can't wait to see the back of him, and a brother with Down's Syndrome shut away in an institution, is it any wonder he retreats into an alternate personality - that of six-year-old Georgie? It is Georgie who befriends Susan Harper, but friendship soon turns into obsession. When Susan begins to distance herself, something inside Georgie snaps and he embarks on a killing spree, with Susan as the next target.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Twisted Nerve is a rather well made film about a psychopathic young man who regresses to an infantile, rage filled personality when stressed or sexually atracted to another person. Released in the United States in 1968 by National General Pictures, the film was controversial for its suggested link between downs syndrome and psychopathology.The film was a box office disapointment probally because it was marketed as an axe-killer psycho movie, which it is not. Although there are a few shocking scenes, this film is a character study of a person damaged by his herediary and his overly protective, seductive mother.This film is nearly impossible to see if you didn't catch it in 1968. It was available from Thorn/Emi in Austraila, but I believe its OOP.</p>
