<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a road movie of two women, one is a former teacher, Cleopatra who makes everything after her retirement, she lives with her depressed husband. The other is Sandra an Argentinian soap opera star, who is becaming a superstar, with a millionar contract to make a soap opera in Miami and replace Sandra Bullock in a movie. Cleo is funny but had panic scene, Sandra get tired from her fame and her love relationship with her producer, and suffered from bulimia. So after they met, both decided to leave Buenos Aires and travelled around the country. After a car accident they met Carlos(Leonardo Sbaraglia), a truckman who offers to go to Mendoza. The three start a trip that will change theirs life. The movie is wonderful, not perfect but wonderful. The cinematography is excellent with the Natural beauty of the Mendoza Province. It also have an excellent score. Even when the script have some flaw, the two performances are superb. Norma Aleandro, who won the San Sebastian Trophy and an Academy nomination, is probably the best argentinian actress, and prooves her oficium in this movie as the automnial and funny Cleo, with all her gestual faces that only a excellent actress has. Natalia Oreiro who is famous from her soaps, in her seccond movie is a revelation. She is a TV Soap Opera Star with all her cliches. She had only one movie before "Un argentino en Nueva YorkÂª" that was very succesfull but the movie wasn't good, and her perfomance wasn't great. In Cleopatra seems for the first time Beautiful. In her soaps she looks pretty or sexy but in this she is beautiful, as she said was Mignona eye. She left lot of her cliche from being a moderated actress. Probably in this movie she felt from the first time she is an actress. She plays the role very well, and with her beauty gives a beautifull soul to the film. However Cleopatra is Norma Aleandro, and all the laurels goes to her.</p>
