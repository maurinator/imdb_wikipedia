<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The last half hour of this film may well be the most emotionally intense examination of a personal moral crisis ever put on film.The movie achieves that rarest feat of being able to portray one of the most horrendous experiences in human history without resorting to sensationalism or sentimentality.The acting of Josef Kroner and Ida Kaminska is without peer and the musical score is quite simply haunting and adds immeasureably to the film's overall effectiveness.Make every effort to see this true cinematic masterpiece.</p>
