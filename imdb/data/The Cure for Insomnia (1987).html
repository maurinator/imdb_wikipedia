<h1>The Cure for Insomnia (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film is basically an experiment designed to reprogram biological clocks for insomniacs so they can sleep again. L.D. Groban reads his own poem during the span of about four days, which is interspliced with stock footage of heavy-metal videos and x-rated footage.</p>
<p>Not really following any standard plot structure, the film mostly consists of poet L.D. Groban reciting his own poem of 4,080 pages, inter-spliced with X-rated film footage and rock music videos.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>well i spent the last year watching whenever possible this 85 hour film if you can call it that.  even if you dont call it a movie its nevertheless brilliant.  ANY man who can film a movie of this magnitude deserves an oscar for best attempt. i heard that at some college kids sat and watched all day for a few days this movie which is just plain ridiculous without a real plot its just mindless babble (often hilarious,often no purpose) well never the less check it out next time u have 85 hours to your self</p>
