<h1>Shadows and Fog (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A small and insignificant bookkeeper, Kleinman, is awoken one night by his neighbors who wants his help to track down a strangler who has been killing people all over town. The citizens form vigilance committees, but when Kleinman has dressed, his neighbors have disappeared. Meanwhile a circus has come to town. Irmy and Paul are two of the artists. After a fight, Irmy leaves the circus in the middle of the night. Eventually she meets Kleinman, scared and alone.</p>
<p>With a serial strangler on the loose, a bookkeeper wanders around town searching for the vigilante group intent on catching the killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A stellar cast, lovely B&W cinematography, funny dialogue (mostly taken from Allen's play "Death"), a wonderful score of the music of Kurt Weill, a mild satire of Kafka, etc. Reviled by many -- I loved it.</p>
