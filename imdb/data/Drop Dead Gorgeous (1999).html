<h1>Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a small Minnesota town, the annual beauty pageant is being covered by a TV crew. Former winner Gladys Leeman wants to make sure her daughter follows in her footsteps. Explosions, falling lights, and trailer fires prove that. As the Leemans are the richest family in town the police are pretty relaxed about it all. Despite everything, main rival (but nice) Amber Atkins won't be stopped. There could well be more death and disappointment to come.</p>
<p>A small-town beauty pageant turns deadly as it becomes clear that someone will go to any lengths to win.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really found Drop Dead Gorgeous great!! I've seen it on TV and I found it really hilarious. Humour is very dark and second degree, mocking as much beauty pageants and deep America and the decision ways in small towns as well as the fake values so often praised by mainstream television. Several scenes are incredibly funny (but cannot be described here in order to avoid spoilers).The cast is great (and includes the marvelous Denise Richards as well as a bunch of Young great actresses)and the scenario follows its dark humor to the end of the movie.Definitively a movie to watch, especially if you are open minded and like deep irony and subtle but strong messages.</p>
