<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is no earthly reason to watch this movie unless you are a huge fan or relative of one of the filmmakers/actors. It is completely inoffensive with nothing wrong and nothing right about it. It is very predictable. It has very little action. It is very boring. For example, none of the Indians were bad guys, and most of the townsfolk liked the Indians. Nice in real life, not so good for movies. I couldn't wait for it to be over.Three small note-worthy things: (1) Brad Dexter has a pretty big part as the heavy. He is the one actor amongst "The Magnificent Seven," who remained pretty unknown.; (2) I was very impressed with the gorgeous beauty and charisma of the actress who played McCrea's good neighbor on the wagon train, who continued on to California, leaving McCrea in Oklahoma. She isn't credited in the movie. I looked her up, Diane Brewster. Yummy! Too bad she didn't star as a female lead! and (3) if they were so offended by the smutty rumors about the Gloria Talbott character, they shouldn't have let her run around in that tight red dress.</p>
