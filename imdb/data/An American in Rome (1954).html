<h1>An American in Rome (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nando Moriconi is a young Italian living in the early '50s Roma. He is completely crazy for everything that comes from the States. He tries to speak American-English (the most funny ever), to wear like he thinks Americans do, to walk like John Wayne (!), trying to eat cornflakes with ketchup... His life is a complete parody of the real American way of life, which he couldn't ever get. Nando's, not so secret, dream is to go to the USA. To get it he goes to the Coliseum and threats to suicide if American Embassy don't give him the visa. But at this point Nando is very well known as a 'crazy-for-USA' boy and the troubles he provoked in the past, couldn't help him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the most famous and loved pictures of the late Alberto Sordi. He plays the role of Nando Meniconi, a young man crazy about U.S.A., in line with the post-war attraction for the country that wins the comflict and "free" Italy. Wearing in denim with a basketball hat, crazy about Joe DiMaggio, Nando is a living danger for all is around him; parents, girlfriend, occasional partners. The plot is confused and low budget; some of the situations are only a veichle for the non-stop improvisative vein of the master actor but this movie is very memorable because is Sordi state-of-art. This is a portrait in which a lot of italians would be recognized. And, if you know italian language, you can laugh all the time. Is a counterpoint for the neorealism school; where you have realism and social critic here you have innocent but funny and realistic parody of costumes and mentality of the italian boys of the '50; chewing gum, toy guns and...hopes for a far, young, winner land...Noew is different but I think that America craze exist the same today!!! w Nando and his spaghetti!!!</p>
