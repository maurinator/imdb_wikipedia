<p>Dishwasher 'Bill Jackson' thwarts a robbery; resulting publicity fingers him as the 12-years-missing Richard Kinkaid, wanted for murder.

It develops that these prosperous young folks have gone down in the world. Paul and his father, a one-armed ex-cop, have a week to find them...</p>
<p>The suspect in a 12-year-old murder case is finally caught and tried, but the witnesses are a bit hard to track down...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jam Packed Little Movie with Probably more Characters than the Budget or the Short Running Time can Encompass. There is much Cynicism in the Fate of the Many "Witnesses" to the Murder at Hand. Some like Mental Illness, Alcoholism, and Class Elitism are quite at home in the World of Film-Noir.The Movie does its best to keep all the Players in Line but it can be somewhat of a Challenge to keep them all Straight. But it makes up for the Contrivances with some Sharp Cinematography and Deeply Affected Participants. There is the Wrongly Accused Man trying to Unwind the Events that happened Years before, and Gig Young is the Public Defender trying Desperately to Help.The Film is so Full of Interesting Stuff that it Manages to be Entertaining Despite the Confusion. There is more than one Great Scene and some others that are Lurid B-Movie Delights. In the End it just Needed more Breathing Room to Elaborate on some of the Truly Interesting and Off-Beat Characters. But as it Stands there are some really Intriguing Interludes and doesn't Pull Punches as it Relies on some Stylized Realism for its Portrayal of Pulp Fiction.</p>
