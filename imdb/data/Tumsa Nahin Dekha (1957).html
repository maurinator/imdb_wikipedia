<h1>Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Twenty years ago, after killing his brother, Sardar Rajpal flees from his hometown in Shillong and re-locates in the rural area of Assam along with his adopted daughter, Meena. He asks his wife, Kamla, to send their son, Shankar, so that he can employ him and get him married to Meena. Shankar arrives and he is welcomed by Sardar who employs him and introduces him to Meena. A few days another young man shows up at his door claiming that he is Kamla's son. A baffled Sardar also welcomes him, and puts both the young men under observation in order to find who the real Shankar is. The question remains why would anyone want to impersonate Shankar, and what will happen to Sardar himself after the Police catch up with him for killing his brother 20 years ago.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nasir Husains gem of a movie, story is quite predictable however the editing and background score of the music keeps the viewers glued to the TV set. O.P Nayyar at his best in the music composition. All songs are evergreen melodies, my personal favorite is 'Dekho Kasam se...'.One thing most noticeable about O.P.Nayyars composition is the ability of him to create such feet tapping, easy listening and melodious numbers. Definitely worth a watch. Also Shammi Kapoor is great with his excellent comic timing and Ameeta is gorgeous. Pran is little bit sober than his usual villain performances but still great acting.</p>
