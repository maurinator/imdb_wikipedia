<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Glenda Jackson and George Segal made a great couple in the Oscar-winning classic "A Touch Of Class" (1973).  Her very English nature, and his American-ness, both clashed with and complemented each other beautifully.In "Lost and Found" the same qualities just make their constant nasty conflicts annoying.  They both have their moments - Glenda's drunken tirade at the Chinese restaurant is particularly superb - but the film drags on and on with a series of pointless screaming matches and tantrums.  And when Paul Sorvino's talkative taxi driver arrives on the scene the film becomes barely watchable, and loses all sense of realism.Extremely dull direction, poor scripting, awful music, and bad cinematography don't help.  And why did they film all of Glenda's close-ups in soft focus!!!  It looks ridiculous.  Why couldn't they just trust her admittedly unusual, but still very sexy, face??It's all a waste of two top actors at the peak of their careers.</p>
