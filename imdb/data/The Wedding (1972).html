<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gunsmokes, The Wedding, was a touching drama about a rancher and his daughter,Donna Clayton played by Melissa Newman who has fallen in love with one of the ranch hands on her father's spread. Morgan Woodward as Walt Clayton the father of the girl, perfectly paints a portrait of a tyrant, to the point you find yourself hating him as he plots to come between the two young lovers. The groom Cory Soames was a surprise as portrayed by a young Sam Elliot. Sam with no mustache and also without his distinctive deep and graveled voice gave a tender interpretation of a rough around the edges cowboy who bravely stands up to the jealous and unyielding cattleman. The shows content caught my imagination as it captured the hateful attitude of the father and his manipulation of those around him to obtain what he wanted, but as usual in it's weekly renderings Gunsmoke was a family show and The Wedding was enjoyed as only one of the series best.</p>
