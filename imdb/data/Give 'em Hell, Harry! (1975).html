<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One man show about the presidency of Harry S Truman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a great filmed stage presentation of James Whitmore's one-man show about Harry Truman, written by Samuel Gallu.  He becomes President Truman right from the beginning.  This show, along with the Will Rogers USA and the not-as-well-known Bully or Bully Boy (Theodore Roosevelt) is the complete list of one-man shows this fine actor has done.</p>
