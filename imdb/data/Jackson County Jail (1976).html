<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is about a woman getting into trouble - nothing more and nothing less. she gets robbed by two hitch-hikers, she's put into prison because she ain't got a passport anymore, a policeman rapes her and she kills him after that and escapes with a prisoner...The movie continues this way, event-event-event... Director Michael Miller is so concerned about being boring, he leaves feelings and emotion.Jones and Mimieux do their parts well, especially Mimieux. Too, I miss at least a few experiments with camera and music, but if you don't want to think about a movie this might be right for you.</p>
