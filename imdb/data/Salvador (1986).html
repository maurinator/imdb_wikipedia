<h1>Salvador (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A journalist, down on his luck in the US, drives to El Salvador to chronicle the events of the 1980 military dictatorship, including the assasination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. He forms an uneasy alliance with both guerillas in the countryside who want him to get pictures out to the US press, and the right-wing military, who want him to bring them photographs of the rebels. Meanwhile he has to find a way of protecting his Salvadorean girlfriend and getting her out of the country.</p>
<p>Oliver Stone's fictionalized account of journalist Richard Boyle's year in El Salvador during very turbulent times in 1980-81. Down and out in San Francisco, Boyle and a colleague Doctor Rock head to El Salvador in his beat up car. There he manages to reunite with former girlfriend Maria and her younger brother. Boyle is naturally suspicious of government officials who see the communist guerrillas as a major threat. As Boyle continues to push local and U.S. Embassy officials for answers he soon becomes a target and must find a way to flee - with Maria - before he too becomes one of the disappeared.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The cinematic equivalent of being busted in the chops over and over again until you can only fall, this, along with his TALK RADIO, is Oliver Stone's masterpiece.It is one of the most driven dramas I have ever witnessed, a work propelled by anger, a burning sense of justice and fiery humanism. It depicts a corrupt, murdering regime with savage focus and makes no dramatic concessions to the incendiary material.Financed slightly outside the Hollywood system, it boasts a dozen extraordinary performances and a brand of camera-work (by Stone regular Robert Richardson) that expertly marries documentary-style coverage to classic composition.SALVADOR has so much to say, but it concludes having not said it all because it hasn't the time.It's quite incredible.</p>
