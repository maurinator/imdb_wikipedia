<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Winning ensemble comedy about the humurous and tragic tribulations of parenting that is for all ages. Robards is wonderful as the patriarch of the family but it's Martin who stands out, especially in the wonderful "Cowboy" scene. The film is heartfelt and ends on a tender note. Randy Newman leads his through the work with his grand tunes. He was Oscar nominated for his song, "Love to See You Smile." Wiest was also Oscar nominated.</p>
