<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The babysitters club were a very popular line of books that all the girls were reading, and now it came on a feature length film.  all 6 or 7 of the girls have a different personality, and come together with the purpose of earning some extra cash.. and staying friends forever.  I believe that the girl power isnt faked, unlike the spice girls views of the power that girls possess.  the friends all go through this summer, with a lot of teenage drama that leads us down the path of growing up.  and there is no loss when they bring 2 attactive young men to be falling in love with some of the babysitters.  kristy was not a favorite of mine, she seemed to be into the club for the wrong reasons, but in the end she puts the problems on the table rather than her sneaking around and not telling her friends that care the truth.  dawn, the earth loving plant eater, falls for an 18 year old and they have some fun together.  the art girl (dont remember her name) wants to go to new york to fill her artsy moods, and the others were there to fill in the void.  mary anne was the conservative organized one with the babe of a boyfriend.  rachael leigh cook and larisa o. probably launched their movie careers from this, making them the teen screens.  its a good movie for the potential babysitters across the nation, and the moral is friends will always be there for each other.  isnt that a unique moral?
