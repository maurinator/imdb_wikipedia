<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sleek and stylish thriller has federal investigator Debra Winger (in a feisty, sensual, fully thought-out performance) believing one enigmatic woman is responsible for the sudden deaths of three millionaires--the wife of each man, in different guises. Icy, cat-like Theresa Russell isn't as gripping as her co-star, though her tightly-controlled characterization is right for this role. Film rushes its last act, with a finale that feels truncated, but otherwise it is an engrossing, superlative chess match between two brainy, attractive women. Great direction (minus the finale) by Bob Rafelson, beautiful cinematography by the esteemed Conrad Hall, gorgeous locations; also, very fine supporting performances by Terry O'Quinn, Sami Frey, Lois Smith, Diane Ladd, Leo Rossi, and terrific cameos from Dennis Hopper and Nicol Williamson as two of Russell's unfortunate husbands. ***1/2 from ****</p>
