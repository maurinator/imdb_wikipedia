<h1>Love at Twenty (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"Love at Twenty" unites five directors from around the world to present their different perspectives on what love really is at the age of 20. The episodes are united with the score of Georges Delerue and still photos of Henri Cartier-Bresson. The directors create their peculiar scenarios with Truffaut revisiting Antoine Doinel, this time finding some meaning to his life while getting involved with a girl; Renzo Rossellini's episode about an abandoned mistress; Ishihara's tale about an obsessive love; Oph√ºls' story about a pregnant woman trying to plot against the baby's father; and Wajda presenting a confusing relationship between people from different generations.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This picture is worth watching just for Truffaut's terrific episode...it's too great for words. What a wonderful time that most have been back then when teenagers went to Mussorgsky recitals... not very common today, unfortunately. Anyway. Unlike American films which often show love in a artificial way, Truffaut and the other directors of the New Wave show realistic love, how it can be in real life. I love the way they film. The next episode (in Rome) is not quite as good as Truffaut's. In fact, it's real horrible. It almost ruins in otherwise a great film. The Japanese part is very good, but weird. I can't see why there must always be someone who dies in every Japanese film. The final episode in Poland is the 2nd best in the set. To conclude, I liked this movie a lot. It's the sort of film that makes you happy afterwards. And it's funny too. 5 out of 5?</p>
