<h1>Bananas (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fielding Mellish (a consumer products tester) becomes infatuated with Nancy (a political activist). He attends demonstrations and tries in other ways to convince her that he is worthy of her love, but Nancy wants someone with greater leadership potential. Fielding runs off to San Marcos where he joins the rebels and eventually becomes President of the country. While on a trip to the states, he meets Nancy again and she falls for him now that he is a political leader.</p>
<p>In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is murdered in a Coup d'Ã‰tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas. In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish meets the political activist Nancy and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito. However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him.</p>
<p>Nebbish Fielding Mellish works as a product tester for a large corporation in New York. His relationship with Nancy, a social activist, is the first he's had in quite some time. So when Nancy breaks up with him - she knowing something is missing, but not being able to put her finger on what that is - Fielding believes the way to win her back is to get into activism, most specifically to move to the Latin American republic of San Marcos, where the elected president was assassinated and replaced by General Emilio M. Vargas, a military dictator. Nancy first met Fielding in trying to get signatures on a petition for the US to break all ties with the military government. Being an American, Fielding ends up being used as a pawn between Vargas and the revolutionary forces, led by Esposito, that function of pawn which may have fatal consequences for him. The question becomes if he is able to survive whether his actions in San Marcos will produce his desired end goal of getting Nancy back.</p>
<p>When a bumbling New Yorker is dumped by his activist girlfriend, he travels to a tiny Latin American nation and becomes involved in its latest rebellion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bananas is like a cookie-batter of all of those early Woody Allen jokes all plopped into a bowl and shaken around. It's a film loaded with political jokes, but without a direct focus aside from Cuba and dictators and the like. There are numerous sexual jokes, including one of Woody's funniest scenes involving a magazine (the buying and holding on a subway, very silent comedy-like). And even Howard Cosell becomes an iconic figure in Woody's comedy in the brilliant opening scenes. The plot is very loose, so if you're looking for that look elsewhere. Also, to put it mildly, some of the jokes may not work at all for some viewers of today. But it's the go-for-broke irreverence of the picture that has it still worth viewing today. Much of Woody's own verbal bits are very good, but it's also worth to note how the physical comedy- while crude and a little off-key- also has a good ring to it. Unlike the director's later films, you can still sense that he's trying to 'get' how to make a film, and so in trying to do anything he can think of to get a laugh, of course, some of it doesn't work. For example, in Cuba the gag where the gargantuan pile of dung is carried down the stairs with the Lain music in the background gives a grin, but not as big a laugh as might be intended. Indeed, this might be Woody's most 'immature' film, while still containing some of his more biting, satirical jabs at dictators and oddball politics. Woody would still have this wild, go-for-broke style of humor more akin to some of his quirkier short stories in other films of the early 70s. While this isn't as successful in that regard as Sleeper or Love and Death, I'd still watch it again if it was on TV; even the romantic subplot, undercooked in comparison with the rest of the more satirical stuff, is interesting.</p>
