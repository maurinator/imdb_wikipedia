<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those anime movies I first saw on regular television.  It was very cool and unique and started my love affair with these types of cartoons.  The only other anime movie I saw before this one was one called in English "Warriors of the Wind".  I saw that one when I was a bit young though and I didn't know what was going on so I can not really review it.  I remember it being rather good though.  The reason I like this one though is that it is sort of the old plot of a man going against vampires and wolfman and all sorts of other supernatural creatures, but there is a bit of a futuristic twist that I rather like.  The story has a girl bitten by a vampire and destined to become his bride.  She is in luck though as a vampire hunter named D has come to town.  This guy really is a good fighter and he uses every trick in the book to take down the evil in the castle.  He has a rather unique sidekick as well.  Twists and turns abound in the movie as do betrayals and vengeance.  This one has it all and some great animation and action as well.  When I saw this one later on cinemax I was kind of surprised to see it had some brief nudity in it as well, but nothing that lasts to long.  Quite frankly, that was about the only difference I saw from the television cut to the movie cut...not really too much of a big deal.  All in all a very satisfying anime classic.</p>
