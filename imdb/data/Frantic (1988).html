<h1>Frantic (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A doctor and his wife go to Paris for a medical conference. While showering, his wife disappears. His lack of language, and the odd way she disappeared makes it nearly impossible for him to find any official help in his search as he enters the punk/drug culture to find out what has happened to her.</p>
<p>While in Paris attending a conference, Dr. Richard Walker's wife Sondra mysteriously disappears. When the French police prove to be of little help, he begins the search by himself. What he finds is a confusing mix-up, but one that could prove to be extremely dangerous and would perhaps be even more so if the police got involved.</p>
<p>Ford plays an American doctor whose wife suddenly vanishes while the couple is visiting Paris. To recover her, he navigates a puzzling web of language, locale, laissez-faire cops and triplicate-form bureaucrats. Ultimately - and reluctantly - he must try a defiant, mysterious waif who knows more than she tells about the woman's kidnappers.</p>
<p>In a hotel room in Paris, a doctor comes out of the shower and finds that his wife has disappeared. He soon finds himself caught up in a world of intrigue, espionage, gangsters, drugs and murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent film from start to finish. The plot is somewhat simple, but the acting of Harrison Ford (Walker) and Emmanuelle Seigner (Michelle) throughout make it an unmissable movie. At times it seemed as if Walker and Michelle would 'get it on', especially in the dance scene in The Touch of Class Club. However Walker didn't let his mind slip for one minute, totally focused on rescuing his wife.</p>
