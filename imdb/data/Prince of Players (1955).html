<h1>Prince of Players (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A tragic and sentimental story that depicts the early career of the 19th century American actor, Edwin Booth with some mention of the events leading to the assassination of President Lincoln by Edwin's brother, John Wilkes Booth. In the film, Edwin's days in the spotlight dwindle shortly after his brother is caught and killed for assassinating Lincoln.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen this movie on late-night TV and taped it from satellite. Burton is one of my favorite actors and is very under rated. When Burton is doing the scenes from the Shakespeare plays it is nothing short of stunning. The only reason I didn't give the movie a "10" rating is there were not enough scenes from the plays. John Derek who plays Edwin's infamous brother John can't begin to hold a candle to Burton simply speaking with him in a simple scene. The only other actor in the movie even close to matching Burton's talent is the great Raymond Massey. I haven't seen this movie available on DVD or even VHS. It's a shame hardly anyone has seen this fine film. When I recorded the movie onto S-VHS tape from C-Band satellite, it was the best source available. Far superior to crummy cable. It looked like the film was shot in Technecolor. Big budget for 1953. Maybe IMDb could get a word to someone in Hollywood that this is worthy of at least a special edition DVD. Heck, they released a "Superbit" of Anaconda. If J.Lo can get a hi-res DVD I think Burton deserves one too.</p>
