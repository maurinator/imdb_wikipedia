<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>but like the original this movie doesn't have much laughs,but once again the characters make the movie fun. i iike this one about the same as the original,but for some reason i watch this movie a lot more than the original. i guess maybe more memorable scenes than the first one,im not sure. both wayne's world movies could be even better if they had more laughs,but like i said the characters make it fun,and watchable. both plots for the two wayne's world movies are not as dumb as the plots in the two austin powers movies. but both austin powers movies had a lot more laughs. but the wayne's world movies are still fun. i give wayne's world 2 **1/2 out of ****</p>
