<h1>Judex (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Favraux, an unscrupulous banker, receives a threatening note, signed by "Judex", demanding that he pay back the people he has swindled. He refuses, and apparently dies after a midnight toast at his masked ball. However, he is only drugged by Judex and locked away. Judex spares his life when the banker's widowed daughter, Jacqueline, rejects the inheritance. Meanwhile Diana Monti, the former governess, kidnaps Jacqueline to try to get the banker's money. But Judex is hot on her trail.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Every bit as good as the original serial (and shorter!), Judex is a masterpiece. I've had quite a few arguments over whether this was the director's best with partisans of "Eyes Without a Face"... though it's a close call. Edith Scob's performance is astonishing (more so for the early '60s) - she also appeared in Bunuel's exquisite "Milky Way", but little else.It's too bad that Franju never had the chance to make more films - he was a real master.Maybe TCM will book Judex on one of those late Friday cult programs. Until they do, I found a fairly good copy through Atlas Visuals.</p>
