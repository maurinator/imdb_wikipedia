<h1>Valley Girl (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Julie, a girl from the valley, meets Randy, a punk from the city. They are from different worlds and find love. Somehow they need to stay together in spite of her trendy, shallow friends.</p>
<p>Julie Richman(Deborah Foreman) is a sweet-natured, if shallow, Valley Girl. After breaking up with her jerk boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen), she is at her friend Suzi Brent's (Michelle Meyrink) party ("the social event of the season") when two boys from Hollywood crash the scene. One of them, the sensitive and adventurous Randy (Nicolas Cage), is immediately smitten with Julie, and she with him. Julie's friends, however, are not smitten with Randy purely because he is from "Holly-weird" and want Julie to dump Randy and get back together with Tommy. Julie must decide which is more important: her heart and the boy she loves, or the approval of her friends. A side story involves Suzi and her stepmom (Lee Purcell) vying for the attention of Skip (David Ensor) the grocery delivery boy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first time I saw Valley Girl, I was bedridden and as sick as a dog, out of junior high school for two weeks with a nasty illness.  I watched it on a tiny black and white set with the volume turned down to a whisper so my parents wouldn't hear and make me shut it off.  I was mesmerized.  It was a revelation.  Martha Coolidge's milking of the Romeo and Juliet premise (with Nicolas Cage and Deborah Foreman filling in as star-crossed lovers in the San Fernando Valley) was smart and convincing.  I was amazed by the hot "Val" chicks.  I was thrilled by the interesting vocabulary words.  I wanted to be like Cage's tough Randy and fall in love with a beautiful girl like Foreman's Julie to the sounds of Eddie Grant, Modern English, and The Plimsouls.</p>
