<p>The story of exploited textile factory workers in Turin, Italy at the turn of the century and their beginnings of their fight for better working conditions.

When an older worker loses a hand in an accident with a machine without receiving compensation from management, a former high school teacher turned labor organizer is dispatched to Turin to direct a strike.</p>
<p>A former high school teacher turned unionist tries to organize workers laboring with inhuman conditions at a late 19th Century textile factory.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Titled "I Compagni" (The Comrades), 1964 American release of this controversial Italian film was as The Organizer, no doubt to avoid an anti-Communist reviewer backlash. While Marcello Mastroianni's Professor Sinigaglia endures some embarrassing indignities, he overcomes them. Working-girl refugee Niobe (wonderfully portrayed by Annie Girardot) helps him both emotionally and nutritionally. This is a wonderful film about not giving up on solidarity. I hold it in higher esteem than Norma Rae, one of the very few other films about working people organizing. The film suffers from being viewed as a not-so-funny comedy because of its over-individualized title. For many years, it was difficult to get a print for showing. Bosley Crowther favorably reviewed it for New York Times 7 May 1964. There is a review in Film Quarterly, Autumn 1964, which I have not seen.</p>
