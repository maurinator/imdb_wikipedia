<h1>Pressure Point (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An African-American prison psychiatrist (Sidney Poitier) finds the boundaries of his professionalism sorely tested when he must counsel a disturbed inmate (Bobby Darin) with bigoted Nazi tendencies.</p>
<p>During the turbulent Civil Rights era of the early 1960s, a young white psychiatrist becomes discouraged with his inability to reach a disaffected, institutionalized young black man. The supervising psychiatrist, who is also black, encourages his subordinate by relating his own experiences twenty years earlier when he was a prison psychiatrist assigned to the distasteful task of treating a viciously paranoid race-baiting Nazi charged with sedition.</p>
<p>When a young psychiatrist comes to his Afro-American chief to tell that he can not bear a thirteen year-old patient, the doctor discloses a similar experience he had when he was a rookie and worked as prison psychiatrist. In 1942, the doctor is assigned to give psychiatric treatment and evaluate the dangerous American Nazi patient accused of sedition. The racist patient has nightmares and insomnia and the doctor analyzes him along eighteen months, finding the reason of his disturbance. The patient convinces the board of direction that he deserves to be on probation but the doctor is reluctant and diagnoses that the patient has only resolved his sleeping problem but is still a despicable bigoted person.</p>
<p>A black prison psychiatrist is assigned the distasteful task of helping a paranoid American Nazi charged with sedition.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pressure Point is a taught drama that pits a Nazi prisoner against an black psychiatrist.  The story, its presentation and direction are remarkably ahead of their time, and present an object lesson in good cinema that might have saved us such unfortunate and forgettable pretension as Memento if only people bothered studying cinema before inflicting their version of it on the moviegoing public.Bobby Darin plays the charismatic young man who is imprisoned during WWII for Nazi activities in the U.S.  Poitier is riveting as the doctor who treats him for insomnia, but discovers pathologies many times more horrifying.  If you're looking to see this timeless conflict wrapped up neatly at the end or overinflated with empty gimickry, be warned.  It doesn't happen.  Thank goodness.  Instead we see a very real ending that explains why events like the World Trade Center tragedy can still happen today.A lot of great films; Prince of Tides, Silence of the Lambs, The Cell and many others owe their existence to such brilliant antecedents.</p>
