<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Khosla's debut movie CID is regarded as one of Bollywood's best crime thriller. Khosla who was assistant director under Guru Dutt learned from his mentor the film-noir (Bombay-noir in Indian context) style and thus directed this 'must see' movie. CID is a crime-suspense movie and the Hollywood influence is showing. The movie is also remembered for songs like "Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan" featuring Johny Walker. The songs is about the city of Bombay and its crooked life. Other hits include "Kahin Pe Nigahen Kahin Pe Nishana" "Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya" "Bujh Mera Kya Naam Re Nadi Kinare Gaam Re".The hugely successful movie will always be remembered as Dev Anand's greatest hits. I recommend it to any fan of Dev Anand or anyone interested in the history of Bollywood. Khosla went on to direct some more hits for the Navketan banner. Including Kalaa Pani and Bambai Ka Babu.8/10 for the movie's Historical Significance in Bollywood.</p>
