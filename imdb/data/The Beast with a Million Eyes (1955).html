<h1>The Beast with a Million Eyes (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An alien space craft lands in the desert. The alien takes over the minds of some of the local humans and animals and is able to see through them. The animals attack and the terror begins.</p>
<p>The Kelley family seems on the brink of dissolution: Allan's date farm is based in the California desert miles from the nearest hamlet, his harvest has been bad for several years, and he insists on sheltering and feeding a hulking mute called "Him" in exchange for chores. Wife Carol is at her breaking point and daughter Sandra finds little respite from the parental bickering in her boyfriend Larry. Then one afternoon, something whirrs overhead and is heard to crash far out in the desert. Shortly thereafter, the kindly family dog attacks Carol, harmless "Him" begins to exhibit menacing behaviors, and other animal life seems to become peculiarly aggressive...</p>
<p>A dysfunctional family operating an isolated date farm in the California desert is threatened by the arrival of an extra-terrestrial.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Most of the reviews of this movie have focused on acting, writing, and production values (or perhaps the lack thereof). This is what makes the film entertaining. In my view, the most interesting aspect of this film is its allegorical quality.This movie was released in 1955, during the blacklist period and the McCarthy hearings. The title refers to the alien's ability to takeover the brains of the lesser animals (birds, dogs, cows, chickens) as well as the brains of weak-minded humans. Doing this provides him with the ability to see what the rest of us are up to. To me, that seems a lot like informing on our neighbors and co-workers. And what's the defense against this alien threat? We defeat it by staying united and sharing our strength.Allegory or no, it's fun to watch the rampaging farm animals (perhaps a precursor to "Black Sheep") and the attacking blackbirds (props, I hope, tossed at a car window).</p>
