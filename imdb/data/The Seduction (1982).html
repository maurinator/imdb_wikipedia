<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen this movie about three times,and its preposterousness(is that a word or did I just make one up?)made it something that practically all parties involved,particularly the leads, would probably want to forget they took part in. Having said that,it is at least marginally interest-emitting and,of course,lovingly sexual.I recall that when this movie was being primed for release in early 1982,the selling point was almost entirely around the (still)lovely Morgan Fairchild--who,at the time,was nursing a floundering career after her series "Flamingo Road" was left to whither on the vine by NBC--and her sex/nude scenes. Sure enough,the scenes where she is sans trow are lovingly shot and have a lushness of editing and sound(her bubble bath scene has a particularly rapturous feel,reminiscent of Angie Dickinson's opening scene in Dressed to Kill) that would make the viewer believe that Andrew Stevens' creepy script boy stalker ISN'T the only one stalking Fairchild's eye-candy news anchor-lady. Another IMDb commenter gave away some perceivably important plot points. Suffice it to say,the thriller/suspense/mystery element of this movie languishes behind the soft-core erotic quality of the film up until the last twenty minutes of the film,when suddenly the urgency of a dangerous stalker(with amazing ability to hide and enter people's abodes)with rapist/deadly abilities comes to the top of the agenda. This is probably ONLY a recommend for FAirchild fans and worshipers,since it is a donut-hole without her.</p>
