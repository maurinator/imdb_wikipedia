<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Buying the Cow" is an extremely well written, highly quotable, overlooked gem of a comedy. Ron Livingston, Ryan Reynolds, and everyone involved must have had a blast making this. If you enjoy the way "Swingers" exposes male insecurities, "Buying the Cow" is your movie. This is definitely one of the best comedies that no one has ever heard of. After you see "Buying the Cow", you will likely be telling your friends, both male and female, that you have discovered comedy gold. The DVD has minimal extras, but with mega-multiple viewing value you won't care. Run, don't walk and rent "Buying the Cow", you will love it. - MERK</p>
