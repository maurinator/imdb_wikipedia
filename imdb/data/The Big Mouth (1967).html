<h1>The Big Mouth (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While fishing on a San Diego beach, Gerald Clamson catches ... a sea diver! Even more weird, the "fish" resembles him. The man, who is not (yet) dead, reveals his secret to the peaceful angler: he is in fact a mobster who has cheated his associates out of their diamonds. What does not help Gerald at all is that the other hoods are persuaded HE is the double-crosser they are supposed to have done away with. Will he get himself out of such a tight situation? He will of course, but not without a little help from Suzie, the girl he only has eyes for!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've lost track of all the times I've seen this one from the first 16mm print at a summer camp in 1970. But I always loved it, no matter how stupid and inane it really is. The plot holes and pure unbelievability of the film must be put aside just for the sillyness. A few things stand out. A cameo by Col. Harland Sanders of KFC, and a view of early Sea World in San Diego. When I worked there in 1985, I found all the places that the film was shot. And the best of all, is Charlie Callas' totally hilarious bit when he sees the appranently dead Sid Valentine (Lewis' other role) come to life again. He comes apart, as do his other friends, but with much more panache and skill. His stuttering, eye-popping gibberish is so funny you have to watch the same dialogue over and over again. It's a classic bit, and one that actually saves the film from being a total Lewis stinker. "That's him, thats him, that's aaaahh, that's im-POSSIBLE!"</p>
