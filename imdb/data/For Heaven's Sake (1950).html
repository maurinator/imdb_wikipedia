<h1>For Heaven's Sake (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two angels, Charles and Arthur, are sent down to retrieve a young girl who has selected the couple she wishes to be borne to but who are so involved in their theatrical lives that procreation doesn't get a look in. To try and ginger things up Charles materialises and poses as a rich potential backer for their next show, only to discover that life on earth can be quite fun.</p>
<p>An angel disguises himself as a crusty old rancher in order to visit Earth and help an unborn child find suitable parents.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film shows up occasionally on cable but has never, to the best of my knowledge, come out on video. It's a lot of fun and Webb, as usual, does a great job as a goofy angel who fancies himself a cowboy. The premise of this movie is that all children are designated, in heaven, a time to be born. If the parents aren't getting along, as in this film, the kids continue to develop mentally. If born years after their designated birthdates, they end up as "one of those horrible child prodigies." Webb and Edmund Gwenn (the original "Kris Kringle") are angels on a mission to ensure that their little wards are successfully delivered. I think Webb is one of the most under-appreciated comics and recommend, if you enjoy this film, checking out "Sitting Pretty" and the original "Cheaper by the Dozen" which are available on home video.</p>
