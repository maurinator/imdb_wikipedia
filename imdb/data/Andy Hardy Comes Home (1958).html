<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mickey Rooney is as cute as ever and smart too. Mickey (Andy) makes a lot of sense in this movie and his mum looks great. It's not as zany as the earlier ones and the plot is really kind of serious and not funny. The boyfriend of this girl looks really nasty and mean and I don't like seeing Andy involved in this scenario at all. I have never seen this last Hardy movie and it's actually playing right now on TCM. I think they played all the Hardy movies from the beginning. I don't see what's wrong with starting an airplane parts factory in the town. It would create jobs for many people. It's my opinion that most people leave small towns because they can't find jobs. I wish they could have gotten Ann Rutherford to play his wife in the movie, not that there's anything wrong with Patricia Breslin, but it would have been much cuter if they saved his marriage for a surprise at the end of the movie and his wife should have been Rutherford.</p>
