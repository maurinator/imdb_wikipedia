<h1>Remake (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>With an interval of fifty years in between, the film brings the experience of the start of the Siege of Sarajevo. Remake tells three tragic stories in one. The first is about the young Bosniak Tarik, who manages to get out of the besieged Sarajevo, where he was violently separated from his aged father. He reaches Paris in 1993, where he starts working on a film script about the life of his father Ahmed, who experienced the outbreak of the World War II in Sarajevo. Remake is however more than a war film. It is also a coming-of-age drama, with scenes in which Ahmed and Tarik (with an intervening period of fifty years) go out with their friends, have fun, fall in love.</p>
<p>This film follows father Ahmed and son Tarik Karaga during WWII and the Siege of Sarajevo.</p>
