<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tigger goes looking through the hundred-acre-wood to find his family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Tigger Movie is a good movie for kids, but for people who expect the original film (The Classic: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh) should just stay home.  The film is worth seeing if you are a rabid Winnie the Pooh fan, a kid who likes it, or are just a movie buff.  The songs are not as creative as last time and the story line isn't as good as the last one(also, you may notice John Fiedler is the only original voice from the first film in this one), but if you are looking for similar characters, some of the same animation techniques, and some new surprises, this film is for you.</p>
