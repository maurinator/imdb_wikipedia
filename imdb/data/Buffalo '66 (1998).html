<h1>Buffalo '66 (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Billy is released after five years in prison. In the next moment, he kidnaps teenage student Layla and visits his parents with her, pretending she is his girlfriend and they will soon marry (and forcing her to say the same).</p>
<p>Billy Brown has been in jail, but his parents think that he's married and successful. When he can't find anywhere in Buffalo where he can pee, he runs desperately into a dance studio to use the washroom. He winds up kidnapping a dance student, Layla to bring home and show off to his parents. The parents just barely remember their son or care about him, but Layla falls for him.</p>
<p>Only one thing could bring Billy's mom any joy: an NFL championship for the Bills. She missed the last championship because she went into labor with Billy. Billy's dad snapped his dog's neck to teach him responsibility. Billy bet ten grand on the Bills to win in the Super Bowl five years before only to lose that bet on a missed field goal. He did five years in prison taking the fall for the bookie he can't repay. Now he's out. He has to do two things while he's out: visit his parents before killing the kicker who not only lost the Super Bowl for the Bills but also put him away. The only problem is he has to piss. He kidnaps a girl from a dance studio where he goes to piss so that she can pose as the fictitious wife from the fictitious life he invented in his letters to his parents from jail. She falls for him instantly. He makes the audience uncomfortable as he ignores her advances as he uses her in his plans to eventually kill the kicker while convincing his parents that he lives far away with his beautiful wife.</p>
<p>After being released from prison, Billy is set to visit his parents with his wife, who he does not actually have. This provokes Billy to act out, as he kidnaps a girl and forces her to act as his wife for the visit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I fell in love with this movie.  Before I saw it, I didn't know much at all about Vincent Gallo.  I saw the trailer that was attached to "Out of Sight" and was like "well, that looks interesting. Maybe I'll check it out sometime."  It took me a long time to track it down, but it was so worth the wait.  One thing I can honestly say, is that the trailer is NOT deceptive. It pretty much tells you EXACTLY what you're going to get.  One thing I wasn't expecting thoug, was the humor.  There were times in this movie that I had to rewind and watch over because I was laughing so hard from the previous scene that I missed what was going on.  Despite the film's depressing tone and deliberately grainy look, there are a lot of laughs here.  Most of them come from the character of Billy Brown. Never in my life, have I seen a more pathetic hero.  The guy is almost totally unlikeable without ONE redeeming quality.  In the opening frame, he's being released from Prison.  He's been there for something like five years and it's obvious that he's coming out of there in the clothes that he was wearing when he went in.  His wardrobe is hilarious and his red ankle boots are a laugh riot.  As are his pants that appear to be about four inches too short.  You can tell when you first see him that this guy is a real piece of work.  The first ten minutes or so focus on our new friend trying to find a bathroom, without any luck. When he finally does find a restroom, he is harassed by an obese homosexual.  This sets up a scene that is kinda sick but darkly funny.Next thing, we learn the plan (part of it anyway) that Billy has up his sleeve.  We meet his lunatic parents through a phone conversation and learn that they are clueless that Billy has been in lockup for the last five years.  Apparently, they are stupid enough to believe that their son has been working in a foreign country as a government agent.  They also believe that he is married.  So he has to find a girl to pose as his wife.    This sets up even more hilarious scenes as he kidnaps a young tap-dancer.  I'm not going to go much farther.  But the movie does get even funnier.  Not only is it funny but it covers a lot of emotions. Here's a guy who's clearly been a loser his whole life, trying desperately to  impress his parents who could care less about him.  It sounds really depressing, but it's actually inspiring and, because it ends on a high note, it's uplifting. While it may not be for everyone, it's still a very entertaining and rewarding film.  It's been a few years since Gallo has done anything, but I'm really looking forward to his next project.If anything, I'd say that this is a black-comedy/character study.  It's probably the most original film of 1998 and it did take a lot of chances with its unique style.  I have no complaints about this movie whatsoever and I'm giving it the highest score possible.  It's a 10+.</p>
