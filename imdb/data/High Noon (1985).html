<p>HIGH NOON The dairy's future is threatened by a rogue thug milkman (Don Henderson) who muscles in on their territory and challenges Dave to a fight at noon. Fairly standard sitcom fare, with the weakling pitted against the seemingly unmovable bully, and spending the episode trying to toughen up (cue Dave attempting to learn Kung-Fu and failing miserably to break planks of wood with his hands). Powell had himself used this plot in an episode of Mind Your Language that saw Barry Evans challenged to a boxing match against a rival teacher. The casting doesn't quite work as well here, mainly because Askwith was quite beefed up at the time, though Henderson makes for a convincing baddie. The payoff is entertaining enough however, with a confrontation shot like a western but with milkmen standing in for cowboys and "do not forsake me oh my darling" wafting on the soundtrack. All of course napped from Benny Hill's Ernie the Fastest Milkman in the West from a decade earlier, but its funny enough for them to get away with second time round.</p>
