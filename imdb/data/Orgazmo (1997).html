<h1>Orgazmo (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joe Young was a simple young man trying to spread the word of the Book of Mormon when he picked the wrong house to preach at! The owner, a porn director named Maxxx Orbison, tells his henchmen to kill the guy at the door who interrupted their scene, but Joe fights off the guards with great skill, which impresses Maxxx so much that he offers Joe the lead role in the movie he's making at the moment: Orgazmo, which is about a sex superhero who fights crime with his Orgazmorator, and ChodaBoy, his sidekick. Joe, against his beliefs, takes the job so that he can pay for the wedding he plans for himself and his fiancée, whom he doesn't tell about his risqué new acting job. However, when the movie becomes an amazing hit just about everywhere and he finds out that Ben (ChodaBoy) has created a real Orgazmorator, Joe is in some serious hot water!</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fans of South Park will love to go back and see the live action movies of its directors, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Orgazmo even features Trey Parker as the main character, Orgazmo.In this hilarious laugh at the porn industry with a bit of a tongue in cheek look at mormons, Trey Parker plays a mormon who happens to be an expert in martial arts who ends up being the accidental star of an adult movie called "Orgazmo". This isn't a fall from grace ride, though, as he keeps most of his morals by using a "stunt cock" and keeps the moral high ground.The movie has jokes at so many levels, including actual members from the porn industry, deliberately bad special effects and a plot that is both funny and interesting, albeit in a slapstick comedy way.Provided that you can get over them making fun of mormons and the porn industry, in other words provided that you aren't a total prude, you will love this movie. Get over the lack of special effects and love this for the cult classic that it is.This is a pure masterpiece of cinema, from the people that bring you the genius that is South Park.</p>
