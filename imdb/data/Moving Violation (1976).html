<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had my doubts about this movie because it was a Roger Corman production. This usually means very low production values. I was surprised as to how good it was.   What helped was that it was on a preminum channel with no cuts, edits or commercials.   The only thing that I did not like was the car chases because they were speeded up way too much. I was almost like the Keystone Cops.   I don't mind chases that are slightly speeded up but these were like a cartoon.   The performances by Steven McHattie, Kay Lenz, Lonny Chapman and Eddie Albert were all first rate.   I recommned it as a Sat. afternoon movie.</p>
