<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't have much expectations while watching this movie for the first time.But i was blown away by this movie.i should say this movie is a complete family entertainer.With a blend of comedy,emotions,songs,fight& investigations covered in a strong storyline.This movie remains among the top of commercial super hits.Rafi-Meccartin has showed their talent for creating super good commercial movies.Roles by the co stars all add flavor to the movie.Music is also a highlight of the movie.All Songs are touching and they can be felt with heart. I would like to conclude by saying that this movie is a Guarantied one.You wont be disappointed by this movie & you will see it again for sure...Three cheers for this one....9/10.</p>
