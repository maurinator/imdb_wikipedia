<h1>Dutch (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Working-class good guy Dutch Dooley is the current boyfriend of a wealthy, snobbish tycoon's ex-wife. Volunteering to drive the woman's son home for Thanksgiving to Chicago from his boarding school in Georgia, little does Dutch expect the picaresque adventures in store for him. When a blunt, down-to-earth construction worker takes to the road with an insufferable twelve-year-old snob (desperately insecure under the surface) who does not approve of him in the least, quite a little must happen before they can reach their destination as friends -- or, for that matter, get home at all.</p>
<p>To get to know his girlfriend's son, a working-class good guy volunteers to pick him up from a prep school - only to learn that her son isn't the nicest kid.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dutch is one of my favorite movies ever. it is so funny, And its always so fun to watch everytime. It never gets old. The things that Dolye and Dutch say to each other are so funny, they always make me laugh. I must say Doyle is a real brat though. Theres so many memorable things in this movie....all the great funny quotes...all of Dutch and Dolye's arguments....the fire works scene...and I really like the scene with the 2 call girl babes :)This is a great movie that I still watch all the time. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh like me ( :</p>
