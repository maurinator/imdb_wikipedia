<h1>Canada (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Created in 1939, the National Film Board of Canada has produced and distributed literally thousands of films by and about Canadians, including hundreds of animated shorts. But despite the fact that these innovative cartoons received several Oscar wins and nominations, most were little-seen by Canada's neighbors to the south.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have said it before and I shall say it again, praise the LORD that Cartoon Network has come into existence.  Since the inception of this original network, animation has entered in dimensions that one has never before fathomed.  One idea that CN capitalized on was showing animated shorts that have come from our best bud from the North.  "O Canada" is a show that appears on CN right after "Adult Swim.  For twenty-five minutes every Sunday night, one can enjoy animated shorts that range from the very informative to the very strange to the very bizarre.  Thanks to the creative minds at Cartoon Network, we get to see the work of creative minds from other parts of the world.  I give this show an A++.My personal favorite one is "The Cat Came Back" and even though I live less than one hundred miles south of the 49th parallel, I probably never would have seen it at all.  I had to look on IMDB to find out that it was nominated for an Oscar.  It wouldn't surprise me that the minds at AKA Cartoon in Vancouver, British Columbia cite this as one of their inspirations for creating their own method of bizarre animation.  Thanks to Cartoon Network, I have been able to see the work these brilliant minds and I hope they keep it coming.  Thanks IMDB and CN for exposing these works to the world!"Canadians are weird!" says Ed for Ed, Edd N Eddy.  I mean that with utmost respect.  I love their work and I hope it never stagnates!Here ends my rant! :)</p>
