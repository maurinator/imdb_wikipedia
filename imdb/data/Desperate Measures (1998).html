<h1>Desperate Measures (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>San Francisco police officer Frank Connor is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his gravely ill son. There's only one catch: the potential donor is convicted multiple murderer Peter McCabe who sees a trip to the hospital as the perfect opportunity to get what he wants most: freedom. With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It may not be perfect, but it's everything an action movie should be.  Great characters (especially Keaton's great bad guy), explosions, chases, everything.  So what if it's predictable.  It's plot is better than you'd expect.  Usually, the bad guy is just killed at the end.  There is no other action movie like "Desperate Measures", because Andy Garcia protects the bag guy from the cops.  If you like action movies, rent it.  It's no best pic, but it's well worth watching.</p>
