<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best historical romances on film. It's the heartwarming story of Andrew Jackson, played by Charlton Heston, and centers on his love for Rachel, superbly acted here by the beautiful Susan Hayward.The start takes us from the early beginnings of their relationship when she was still married to another, but eventually she breaks ties and in time becomes Andrew's wife -- a courtship that takes us from the frontiers to the White House.Life for homesteaders wasn't easy in those times of opening up the west, battling native Indians and fighting wars; however, Andrew gradually progressed up the military ranks although it meant many separations from Rachel. Their position in society had an uneven start, having to deal with scandal surrounding the circumstances of their marriage, yet in time this was slowly overcome, and as the years passed Andrew became more involved in political life, ultimately becoming president.A very human story.</p>
