<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gordon Hessler was not all that great a director.  He wasn't particularly good at setting up interesting shots or getting good performances out of his actors, but occasionally he managed by default to create a movie that was so completely off-the-wall and bizarre that those shortcomings could be forgotten.SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN is a good example of that.  It is by no means a good movie; in fact, it's really pretty bad.  But you literally have no idea where it's headed, and by the time you get there, even though it's a tad underwhelming, it's still just oddball enough to keep you hooked.Basically, it's the story of a serial killer who preys on bar-hopping women, and who, incidentally, seems to have superpowers of some sort.  Or, maybe it's the story of a military conspiracy of some sort?  Or is it the story of some kind of body parts black market?  Believe it or not, all these seemingly unrelated plotlines eventually come together, and it's a wacky ride all the way.The biggest disappointment for me, is the scarce screen time of headliners Vincent Price, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  They literally have less than twenty minutes of screen time combined, and only Lee and Price even appear together, in one very brief scene.  The main characters seem to be a disgruntled Scotland Yard detective, and a younger, less cynical police officer.I recommend this movie to any fan of AIP or any of the three horror stars, but most people will not have the patience to sit through it.  Fans will enjoy it, if only for it's sheer weirdness.</p>
