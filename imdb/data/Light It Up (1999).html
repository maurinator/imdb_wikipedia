<h1>Light It Up (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a winter day in a southside Queens high school, events collide and six students are suddenly in an armed standoff with the NYPD. At the school, classrooms freeze, teachers come and go, resources are scant. When a popular teacher is suspended, a few students protest. Jackson, a new security guard, gets tough. In a scuffle, Jackson's wounded with his own gun and a student takes him hostage. A few kids join in, for various reasons. An ineffective policewoman tries to mediate as the police plan an assault, the kids demand improvements to the school, the media pick up the story, and Jackson turns sympathetic. But are too many forces in motion for the students to stay in control?</p>
<p>A group of teens is bent on improving the run-down conditions of their high-school.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>By the numbers script, in the way that it has unoriginality running through it like a diseased spine, the story isn't new, the histories of the kids gets revealed at certain points.  You probably think I hated this film, but I didn't, it is a 'by the number etc...' but with heart, I felt sad at the end, the 3rd act is a good one and it makes you leave the film happy and angry, not at the film but at the topics covered in the film. I saw this in the theatre and it was good, it's one of those films you'll probably miss, and end up watching on video, and I think you'll like it. The performances are notable too, after seeing She's all that and the Faculty I was pleased to see Usher in a more significant film. Definately one to see, if not on the Big screen, the small one will do just fine.</p>
