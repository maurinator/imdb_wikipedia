<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you see a movie like this you wonder who gave the o.k to make it. This movie came out when I was in Middle School me and 3 of my buddies went to see it. After the movie was over we thought that it was terrible it was sad because 12 year olds back then seemed to love mortal kombat we played all the games and loved the first movie after this one we quit playing the games and moved on in life. It only takes one bad movie to lose a large following. This movie should have never been made or at least have better writers better acting(Lu and Katina were good) the rest were half rate actors. Costumes were terrible also a movie with such a large budget could have had better things, Its better than TimeCop but thats not saying much</p>
