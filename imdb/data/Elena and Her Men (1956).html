<h1>Elena and Her Men (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Polish countess Elena falls in love to a Frensh radical party's candidate, a general, in pre world war I Paris, but another officer pines for her.</p>
<p>Polish Princess Elena believes she was born to be the guardian angel of great causes and great (undiscovered) men. It is only when men need her that she is interested in them and she abandons them when they have accomplished their goals in life. She encounters Henry de Chevincourt who introduces her to General François Rollan, who has just been nominated to become Minister of War. The General is bait for some conniving politicians who wish to turn the hero into a dictator. They take advantage of a current political trial and the resulting war scare to engineer a coup d'etat which is meant to catapult the General into leadership. Rollan lets himself be taken in because he is in love with Elena who is in league with the plotters. Meanwhile, Henry, also in love with Elena, is hanging around on the sidelines.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the end of the Nineteenth Century, on the July 14th Celebration in Paris, the broken widow Polish Princess Elena Sokorowska (Ingrid Bergman) meets the bon-vivant Henri de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer) on the streets. Henri introduces his friend General François Rollan (Jean Marais), who is a national hero. Elena has sold all her pearls and needs to get married to keep her lifestyle. Elena involves with a group of politicians that intend to promote the general to the presidency of France supported by the people. Rollan and Henti fall in love for Elena and dispute her love."Elena et les Homes" is a dull romance in a political environment in France that is homage to love and the French way of life. Ingrid Bergman shines with her beauty performing a likable character. The bright colors highlight the art decoration, with colorful sets and costumes. This movie was released in Brazil on VHS by Mundial Filmes Distributor. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "As Estranhas Coisas de Paris" ("The Strange Things of Paris")</p>
