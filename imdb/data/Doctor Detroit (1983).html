<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I actually grew up watching this movie. No, my parents didn't neglect me. They just understood good comedy - even when it involved hookers. I loved this movie even though I didn't understand half of the jokes. It began my lifelong love affair with James Brown at the tender age of seven. I would run around the house singing "Get Up Offa That Thing", entertaining my whole family. As I got older I could appreciate the humor and that made it all the better. In my eyes this will always be a classic, and I will continue to subject my friends to it's VHS (formerly Beta) greatness. And P.S. I am so sad that it is not available on DVD yet.</p>
