<h1>Time After Time (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Meredith feels smothered by her father's wife, while Derek questions the Chief as to why he can't get the man's approval as his replacement. Alex thinks he's found the real identity to his Jane Doe and Izzy gets a request from out of nowhere, leaving her in shock and no George to turn to.</p>
<p>It seems like just another ordinary day in Seattle Grace Hospital until tragedy strikes Izzie Stevens. To her dismay, the adoptive parents of her eleven-year-old daughter reveal a terrible truth. Her daughter is also a leukemia patient. Deeply saddened by this news, her daughter's adoptive parents also tell Izzie that she should donate some of her bone marrow to the girl. Because it is likely that it will be a "perfect match" ... Also the race to be "chief of surgery" tears Meredith and Derek's relationship apart.</p>
<p>Izzie faces her past and finds comfort in George, while Alex becomes more attached to Jane Doe, Meredith and Derek question their own status, and Cristina resolves to fight for her relationship with Burke -- despite her past with Colin Marlow.</p>
<p>Meredith deals with her over protective stepmother, Cristina is caught between Burke and Marlow, and Derek fights to become Chief. Meanwhile, Alex continues the search for Jane Doe's identity, and Izzie's past comes back to haunt her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was wondering, how is it possible that Izzy's story about her daughter would start and end like that: in only one episode we learn that she actually HAD a daughter when she was 16, that she is ill with leukemia and doesn't want to meet her personally. The next minute (in France we get three episodes in a row, fortunately!) Izzy is having fun with the others at Burke's apartment, while learning in a sort of quiz contest for the final test. It's simply unreal! I think, there's much more potential on that story there, like making her pregnant with George's baby in the season 4, and then (due to her past) not being willing to give it up, although it might be problematic (Callie and so on...) I was quite disappointed in the end. Anyone felt like that?</p>
