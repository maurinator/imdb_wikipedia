<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't seem to find a way to rate this series, so I guess I have to write a review instead. If you ever enjoyed The Office or similar shows, you'll really enjoy this one. I was really surprised by how well done this show really is. The acting has to be top notch to carry a viewer's interest in a program like this because virtually all of the "action" is dialogue between the characters. I immediately fell in love with Ben and Ali's characters. (And yes, I do mean Ali and not Lindsay. Her interactions with Jordan are priceless.) Even Tak was compelling to watch, as his character is complicated, even if only likable at certain times. It honestly doesn't feel like you're watching something cheaper or of less quality than a show that is made for television. If it had aired on NBC instead of Hulu, it would have gotten a LOT more buzz. If you have a few hours, you can watch the entire first season in an afternoon and it's definitely worth it. Do not miss this one!I really hope it comes back for another season because there are still some questions I'd really like resolved.</p>
