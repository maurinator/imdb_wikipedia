<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So we're looking for a movie to watch, and based on the picture of a cow on the cover, my friend picked up the shipment. None of us had heard anything about it before, but apparently, cows are really funny to some people. We noticed that it was billed as a comedy, and therefore expected some humor. Unfortunately for all of us, it was nowhere to be found. I cannot recall, nor can anyone else present at the time, ONE moment where I was compelled to laugh. Not even a giggle. One lucky friend left early due to boredom. We all told him he was crazy. After all, there may yet be one funny part, and wouldn't you be sorry if you left before the only funny part of the movie. Well, if he laughed at all after he left, he was the only one of us. Even more frustrating was the lack of a scene so ridiculously stupid, it was unintentionally funny. One of my personal favorites, Atomic Train, is perhaps the funniest movie I've ever seen, though unplanned. While the acting was awful, the script was terrible, and the plot an innumerable amount of holes, the overall effect was outright hilarity, which left me wanting to watch it again. The Shipment, however, made me mad I saw it. A complete waste of two hours of my life. I would not recommend to ANYONE except perhaps a narcoleptic trying to stay awake. Basically, don't watch this movie, and you'll probably live a happier, healthier life.</p>
