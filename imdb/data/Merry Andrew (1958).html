<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have posted comments before on Merry Andrew, but I don't think I will do any harm by mentioning either the same or different!!! I remember when I first saw this Delightful film in Sydney in 1958. I was sixteen at the time. I have caught it once or twice on tv. I just wish someone would buy the rights to release it on commercial video? Even though it's over forty years old, I would rather go miles to watch it again than some of the other shall we say more questional material at theatres or on tv. I'm fortunate to have bought the s/track & have the movie on tape. Summing up: Excellent & Supurb Family Entertainment.</p>
