<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember being in the theater with my friend, and she turned to me and said about Costner "He is just so good in this film" and I replied "He will be somebody someday." This was that kind of film. You felt the performances in your bones.The film had that type of chemistry between all the major players. The plot would just seem like it was going to lag and then you get twisted around again. Three years later I went out and bought the script with a month's worth of money from my first job. I still have that script on my bookshelf. I also have had a copy of this film in my collection for the last 10 years.Sean Young was still at her peak and the limousine scene is unforgettable. It is also proof that you can add sex in a movie without making the audience think they will be taking time away from the theme and plot of the movie. Will Patton of Remember the Titans was also starting his movie career and played his character of a "protect the Director at any cost" to a "T". Gene Hackman was Brice in this movie.George Dzundza as the loyal friend, Iman as the South African caught in the middle of her friend's indiscretion and Chris D. as one of the "Contras" helped round out the supporting cast.Roger Donaldson's direction really helped you feel the tense pace and the closed in feelings in the Pentagon.I gave this film a 9 because it may be seen as outdated due to some cold war references.</p>
