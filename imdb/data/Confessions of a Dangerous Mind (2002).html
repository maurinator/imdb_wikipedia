<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Turan in the LA Times was so right. A shallow, boring unconvincing  film, creating not the slightest interest in any of its characters. In the end, who cares whether the hero was a hitman or not. He is so uninteresting and unsympathetic, it never for a moment matters.</p>
