<h1>The Crimson Permanent Assurance (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the bleak days of 1983, the Crimson Permanent Assurance, an accountancy staffed by elderly workers much like a slave ship, has been taken over by efficiency-minded corporate types. When they sack an employee, there's an uprising, and the building is unleashed from its moorings to sail across the (dry) ocean and take on the financial centers of the world, starting with an all-out attack on the large skyscraper housing The Very Big Corporation of America, complete with filing-cabinet cannons, ceiling-fan broadswords, and paper-spindle short-swords.</p>
<p>A group of down-and-out accountants mutiny against their bosses and sail their office building onto the high seas in search of a pirate's life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short is from the Monty Pyhton's and that is pretty obvious. It is funny, strange, well made, interesting and very imaginative. The story has something to say and it is good satire considering the time it was made.This short is about an uprising by the elderly workers against the corporate young men who treat them like garbage. Their building turns into some kind of pirate ship and they prepare for battle with the corporate world.With lots of humor, a fine production design and a typical Monty Python ending this is a very good short film.</p>
