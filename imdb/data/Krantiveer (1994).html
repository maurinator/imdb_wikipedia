<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mehul Kumar's 1994 drama about the importance of battling social injustice stars Nana Patekar as Pratap, a decent but lazy man unwilling to fight for anyone's cause but his own. He is finally roused to action by a fiery reporter named Megha (Dimple Kapadia) and by the cruelty of a ruthless, exploitative businessman named Yograj (Tinnue Anand). This movie is the most talented scripture I have ever seen. This movie also starring in Mamta, Atul & Danny. The movie features one of the best direction that I have ever seen. This movie is so interesting that I watched it more than 20 times. All the actors must have take there time in making this film.</p>
