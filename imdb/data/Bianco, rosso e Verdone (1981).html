<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three Italian have to move from their current city to vote to local elections elsewhere. Pasquale is an Italian emigrant living in Munich (Germany). He has to vote in Matera, Basilicata (south of Italy). He is genuinely happy to come back in Italy, even if just for some days; but the country he is dreaming is different from the reality he meets. Furio move from Torino to Roma with all his family. He is so niggler and heavy that Magda, his wife, is thinking to escape. Mimmo is a young good fellow, moving with his grand mother, from Verona to Roma. His trip is disturbed by worries about her health, while she is very calm.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie, even if is one of Verdone's firsts, is a milestone in his filmography. It follows by a year Un Sacco bello (1980). Both the movies are just a kind of "collage" of all Verdone characters played during his TV shows in the '70s. Nevertheless clearly we are in front of his first steps as film director, Carlo demonstrated already his big talent to underline trough his comedies the Italians and their defects. For anyone interested in Verdone cinema this is a must. For everyone happy to see a fine comedy about Italians this is a must. To have funny time in the Verdone's way this is a must. Twenty-four year later this "Bianco, rosso e Verdone" is still actual and unequaled. A must see.My vote is 8 (out of 10).</p>
