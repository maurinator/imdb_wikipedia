<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was really good. It happens to be my favorite horror movie! I read the book when the movie was in theatres. I loved the book.....it is my favorite book. But unfortunately.....I didn't get to see the movie. I waited years for this movie. I finally rented it this year and watched it. After 4 years, I wasn't disappointed. But the same night I saw this movie, it debuted on tv for the first time. Sucky coincidence, huh? All I'm asking is that you watch the movie and make your own decision about the movie.</p>
