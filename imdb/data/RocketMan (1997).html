<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I came across this movie while TV surfing, and kept trying to move on but I couldn't. It is wonderful how awful it is! It is definitely one of the silliest movies I have ever seen, silly to the point of stupidity, and I can't remember when I have enjoyed myself more. While I kept telling myself I was too old (and refined) to be as amused as I was, I couldn't stop laughing.If you can sit through it without giggling, someone should check you for a pulse!</p>
