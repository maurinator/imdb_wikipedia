<h1>Till There Was You (2003)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Among the long line of Piolo-Juday rom-coms, Till There was You is arguably the best.With witty dialogue, Till There Was You stands out among other Filipino rom-coms because it is fresh, enjoyable and has an array of fabulous supporting actors from a reliable but semi-rebellious Matet de Leon to a cute Eliza Pineda. Piolo Pascual seems miscast, playing a smarter version of himself. Anyway, the film is effective in evoking laughs, at the same time show off sentimentality that is not over-the-top. Above all, Till There Was You benefits from a strong, spunky and funny turn from Judy Ann Santos who portrayed a clever and ambitious twentysomething. She is off to give better performances but I guess she could always look back at herself here and give it a warm smile.</p>
