<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Imagination.. Heart..Very few sci-fi's have this much heart and this much story packed into a beautiful movie.. So how can I describe Cherry?Cherry starts out like every good story and builds up to it, by first establishing the universe.. a post-apocalyptic world (or sum such) where recycling is important, new fashions are in play and sex robots are possible and people (at least from the characters point of view) have to have contracts to date/copulateCherry then shows us one of the first *real* female action hero's (basically Tomb Raiders Laura Croft v1.0) and some great desert and action sequences that are widely unpredictable and done wellAll the while this stories carries on with credibility and imagination, Cherry 2000 is one of the most successful B movie sci-fi's ever accomplished it's these kinds of movies that give me hope to see more.. I personally love and still love a lot of 80's movies and 80's style we have yet to recapture in our let's make it all more real setting.. I'm not saying that gems aren't still made today they are; they've just been rarer to find as of late..Since Cherry is a special vein of movies all its own it's important we list e'm - Mad Max - The Road Warrior (this one is very special) - Dead-End Drive In What I can say about Cherry after multiple viewing maybe 5-7 now in my lifetime since I first caught in cinemax or one of the movie channels one night.. is that's its very, very special.. That the story is so good that it can play catch-up or compliment movies like "A.I." another one of Kubrick's unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 7/10 but I'm upping my vote to 8/10 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. (note of course sci-fi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001)On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie.. (and there is some noticeable re-use of Conan in there but all composers even the great John Williams seem to re-use in part some of their stuff)</p>
