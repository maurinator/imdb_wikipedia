<h1>Black Eagle (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One of the US Air Force's most modern tactical aircraft, an F-111 Aardvark with a new laser guidance system, crashes into the sea near Malta - a region where the Soviet forces are highly present, too. The CIA immediately sends out their best secret agent, Ken Tami, to salvage the system before it falls into enemy hands. To ensure his loyalty, they bring his two young sons to a nearby hotel on the island. Ken Tami's tough opponent is KGB agent Andrei.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gotta love the movie just for the sakes that Jean-Claude Van Damme is driving a VAZ-2105 in the awesome chase scene! Otherwise the movie is pretty weak. There isn't enough high adrenaline pumped action, and the plot is weak as a senior's back. Love the mediterranean views though.</p>
