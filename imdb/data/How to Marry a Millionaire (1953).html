<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this cute story of gold-diggers on the prowl.  I agree with those who said that musical prologue was way too long -- it was eight minutes before the opening credits came on!  This seemed the perfect setting for Marilyn Monroe to sing "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend," but that gem was in another of her films.  I don't agree with those who said Betty Grable was too old for her part.  She merely *looked* old.  I tried to figure out why.  She was only 35 years old.  She was still slim (possibly even slimmer than Lauren Bacall, who'd recently had her second child) and her face looked relatively youthful.  So why did she look 45?  I concluded it was the hair.  That poodle cut was unflattering and added years. I also enjoyed Grable's coy reference to real-life husband Harry James and Bacall's to Bogart.  All in all, a charming movie and a fun way to spend an hour and a half.</p>
