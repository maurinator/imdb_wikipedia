<h1>Shopping (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lone group of teens, led by recently released joyrider and his disenchanted Belfast girlfriend, strives to leave their mark on "a British city in the near future" while attempting to avoid a rival gang. Scenes of joyriding and ram-raiding, which attempt to portray the addictiveness of fast driving whilst also showing the downside (the effect on the community and ultimately death)</p>
<p>Billy and his girlfriend Jo steal expensive cars and speed them into shop windows (ram-raiding), which they find exciting and gives them an addictive adrenaline rush. There are many fast chases and encounters with the police. Rivalry grows between Billy and Tommy, as both want to be seen as "the hero". Jo wants her and Billy to change their way of life, but Billy wants first to ram-raid the Shopping Mall, because it has never been done before. But, who will get there first, Billy or Tommy? Hard-hitting, fast-moving, ultraviolent drama.</p>
<p>Billy and Jo get their kicks from their special type of window- shopping (driving a car through the window and stealing everything inside. These professional criminals are not in it for the money, but for the fun of it. When Billy gets released from prison, his rival Tommy has taken over the street. A fight for power commences as Billy starts his own gang and hits a shop the day before Tommy had planned to. Tommy makes a move on Billy's girlfriend Jo, who wants Billy to change his lifestyle and move away, instead of fighting Tommy, a fight which will hurt them both. He agrees, but he wants to hit the shopping mall on a final hit. That has never been done before, so it will make him a hero among the others.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This one features a very young Jude Law, and a fairly unknown, Sadie Frost.. an independent film i caught on IFC the other night,, very dark,, lot's of good tracking shots,, especially the opening one.. a group of disenchanted youths crash cars into storefront windows for kicks, and then go shopping,, after 3 months in prison our main guy get's out , and is warned by the Inspector,, so now Billy back out and looking to make a score,, seems to get on the bad side of the new gang leader,, and takes down his store,, so the gang leader decides that he isn't just going to take that lying down,, good chase scenes in a tunnel.. at first i thought that maybe it was the Chunnel,, but i'm not sure.. love the battles that the gangs have with police,, evading them and destroying their cars in the process. overall though it's not for everyone,, it has a niche,, i think you have to look "outside the box" to like this one,, and i'm happy to say i did,, so i liked it very much.</p>
