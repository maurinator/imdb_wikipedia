<h1>Freaks (1974)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was very young when I saw this short animated film. The only recollections of "Street Freaks" I have is that it was shown on cable in between movies in the late 70's, and that one scene had some bum-type disoriented hippie yelling "God Is Mayonnaise" at someone on the street, I think he also spray painted it on the wall too. Then he screamed. For some reason I thought that was very funny, and it stuck with me all these years! Those were fun days, when cable channels were few and little things like this in between features were special. If someone has a copy of "Street Freaks" let me know as I've like to see this again!</p>
