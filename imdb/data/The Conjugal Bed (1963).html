<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marina Vlady won the "best actress " prize at the Festival de Cannes in 1963.Alfonso is a forty-something who wants to marry a young virgin,for is an Italian macho .He had not reckoned on his young wife's sexual appetite ;it will cost him his health .The parallel with the queen bee (check the title) is relevant,although Regina (check the name) is more of a praying mantis.The last pictures show her triumphantly expecting her child .The male rarely escapes unharmed in Ferreri's fables (see also "L'Ultima Donna")Ugo Tognazzi shines as the smug man ,proud of his virility and Marina Vlady was far from her "romantic young lead " parts.</p>
