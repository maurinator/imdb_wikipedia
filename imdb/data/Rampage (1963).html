Chief boy Talib and his team perform excellently and Harry comes to terms with the native Sakai jungle tribe chief. Otto's mistress Anna does a better job at seducing Harry then Talib's wife to customarily 'entertain at night'. So the men are at murderous terms even before they deliver the feline catch, which triggers the dramatic finale.</p>
