<h2> Summaries </h2>

Finally the Vietnamese have had enough and confront the skinheads in an all-out confrontation, sending the skinheads running. A woman who is prone to epileptic seizures joins the skins' merry band, and helps them on their run from justice, but is her affliction also a sign of impurity?</p>
<p>Violent tale of white supremacist skinheads who spend their time beating up anyone who isn't white or who doesn't comply with their version of acceptability. After beating up two young Vietnamese men who just bought their local - the second such attack on Vietnamese in just a few days - skinhead leader Hando and his gang finds themselves under attack by a mob fed up with being afraid to walk the streets. Following a police raid Hando, his best mate Davey and his girlfriend are all that left of the gang and are on the run. In the end, Hando and Davey will clash violently of a disagreement of principles.</p>
<p>A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighbourhood is changing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Caused a lot of controversy in Oz and here in the UK when first released in 1992 and its not that difficult to see why.  This is is no American History X with its somewhat 'weekend' boneheads who still live with mummy and hold down jobs or attend school. Hando and his crew live outside society with no outside control or scrutiny of their actions.There is no attempt by the makers to moralise on what Hando and co get upto, they simply show how it is with Neo-nazi groups Russel Crowe's depiction of Hando surely ranks as one of the greatest portrayals of pure menacing evil ever and the fight scenes are brilliantly staged and edited. For a companion film to this I'd recommend viewing 'Ultra', an Italian language film that follows a group of football thugs in a similar way.</p>
