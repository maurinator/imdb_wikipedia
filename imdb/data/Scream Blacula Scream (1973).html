<h2> Summaries </h2>

Meanwhile, a police officer with a large collection of African antiques and an interest in the occult investigates the murders caused by Blacula and his vampire horde.</p>
<p>The vampire Mamuwalde (Blacula) is stirred by African voodoo, and is forced to kill again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The members of the Count Dracula Society were on to something when they voted BLACULA the scariest (theatrical) film of 1972 (THE NIGHT STALKER, scripted by Richard Matheson, came creeping across tv screens the same year, and rivaled BLACULA for outright fright). SCREAM,BLACULA,SCREAM! proved a worthy follow-up. The voodoo angle was a logical next step, and, for a kid whose preference was for fright films, it did not disappoint. And it STILL doesn't: I caught this one on a cable channel not too long ago, and I was surprised at how creepy it still is, after all these years. Pam Grier's character here is more sympathetic than the vast majority of the parts she's had over the years, and she is more than capable in the role. William Marshall is as majestic as ever. The direction is even better than in the original. All told, a sequel worth seeing.</p>
