<h1>Say a Little Prayer (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Seymour is a loner. A small, shy, introverted eleven year old whose parents are separated. By chance Seymour meets the beautiful, effervescent but drug-addicted Angie, who is also lonely and trapped in her own unhappy world. The relationship that develops offers strength to them both and through the highs and lows of a long hot summer they gradually learn to face the truth about each other and themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was interesting to see the city of Melbourne on television. I don't know whether it's just film quality but every time I see this city on film it looks very isolated and dead.The visual effects in Say a Little Prayer certainly aren't impressive, and no explanation is given about Seymour's "hallucinations." Viewers will just have to assume that he has a great imagination.Say a Little Prayer is quite an average film. The characters are interesting, although Angie can be a little annoying (especially at the beginning). When we learn more about Angie, Seymour starts to change into a mean kid (he shouts in the hospital). And then near the end he's shy and pleasant again. It's okay for characters' personalities to change and evolve but it should be gradual. Perhaps characterization was fine in the novel but during the translation from novel to film important points were cut out.A slightly better Australian film is Lantana.6/10</p>
