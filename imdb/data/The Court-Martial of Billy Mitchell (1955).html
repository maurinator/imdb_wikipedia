<h1>The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The true story of General Billy Mitchell, a pioneering crusader for the Army's fledgling air corp. In spite of an impressive performance during the First World War, the commanders of America's armed forces still think of the airplane as little more then a carnival attraction. Even after sinking an "unsinkable" captured German battleship from the air, Mitchell sees funds dry up and friends die due to poor equipment. He is court-martialed after questioning the loyalty of his superiors for allowing the air corp to deteriorate.</p>
<p>A dramatization of the American general and his court martial for publically complaining about High Command's dismissal and neglect of the aerial fighting forces.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Too add to the comments already made in this database I would like to point out that viewers seem to forget that the testimony in the film by Major Hap Arnold, Captain Eddie Rickenbaker, Major Karl Spatz and Fiorello LaGuardia substantiated Colonel Mitchell's facts.As for whether the court-martial did what it intended to do, obviously it did not in Pearl Harbor's case, however, it may have helped development of better aircraft and aircraft carriers during the 30's, especially when one considers this was during a depression.What could have been brought to light was the complacency of the public at the time, roaring 20's, etc..  Also the public's isolationist outlook.At any rate, General Mitchell will always be a hero to airmen, along with General Hap Arnold and others.</p>
