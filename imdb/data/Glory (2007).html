<h1>Glory (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Haunted by the memory of her child, Glory is drawn to a broken toy doll in a children's playground. Imagining the doll to be a real child, and conjuring up the memory of a past lover, Glory builds the family that she has always dreamed about. Yet even in her idyllic fantasies, the past unravels itself, coiling and ready to strike. GLORY examines the stain of love and tragedy that marks a person through the rest of their life.</p>
