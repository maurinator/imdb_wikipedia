<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed watching this movie, after a while the subtitles seem to fad away and your left with a movie that I feel really relates to everyone, not just same-gender loving men. I thought the realistic view of love used by the director was great. He showed that love, real love, can be a physically painful experience. Love hurts, but its worth it when you find the one that you are willing to defy all odds with. I fell in love with love again, just by watching this movie and understanding that with love all things are possible. It was truly a great movie watching experience. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is open minded and wants to see a well made movie featuring two beautiful people.</p>
