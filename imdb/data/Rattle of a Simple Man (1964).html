<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this film as an impressionable teenager and after the scene where the gorgeous Diane Cilento dances around her bed sitting room she overtook Alexandra Bastedo of The Champions as the most beautiful woman ever. The plot is simple. Group of Manchester United footy fans go down to London for a big match. The quiet, shy northern oik played by Harry H Corbett, accepts a drunken bet to spend the night with the classy Diane Cilento.What follows is an amusing comedy dialogue between the experienced worldly prostitute and shy and awkward Corbett as they dance around the issue. Can she entice him to bed? or will he lose his bet and return, ashamed, back to his friends before the coach leaves at midnight? While this dialogue is going on, the sub plot involves his mates going from pub to pub getting more and more drunk. This is quite amusing also as you warm to the characters as the evening progresses. If you like old films and gentle comedy then this one is a gem.</p>
