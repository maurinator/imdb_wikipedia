<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tale of a non-symbiotic cohabitation between two roommates, American man and Macedonian woman.</p>

<p>A subtly disturbing psychological game of a cat and a mouse living together, alone in a same apartment. Beautfly shot with effective dialog.  Good acting by the feemale character.</p>
