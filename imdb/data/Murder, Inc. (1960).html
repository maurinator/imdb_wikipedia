<h1>Murder, Inc. (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the true-life book of lawman Burton Turkus, this movie chronicles the rise and fall of the organized crime syndicate known as Murder, Incorporated. Focusing on powerful boss Lepke and violent hitman Reles.</p>
<p>It's the mid-1930's Brooklyn. Nightclub singer Joey Collins, newly married to a chorus girl named Eadie, is having problems paying off his loan shark, Abe Reles. Reles will wipe the slate clean if Joey "introduces" him to Joey's friend, Catskills based comic Walter Sage, with who Reles has unnamed business. Joey agrees despite knowing that Reles is planning on roughing up Sage. Joey learns the hard way that Reles is a hit man when Reles instead kills Sage in cold blood. Reles is part of the Brownsville Group - or what would be later dubbed by the press as Murder Incorporated - that works for a crime syndicate. Reles is under exclusive contract to crime boss Louis "Lepke" Buchalter to carry out whatever murders required. Joey and Eadie, now knowing too much about Reles' business, are at a loss on what to do to protect themselves. Things for all concerned change when prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey is appointed to head a special commission against the crime syndicate, Dewey who could subpoena any suspects or witnesses to testify at Grand Jury hearings. Choosing not to testify, Lepke goes into hiding where he meets the Collinses, and increases the killings against anyone who may rat on him at the hearings. With crusading new Assistant DA for Brooklyn Burt Turkus taking a tough stance on the unsolved murders and working with longtime Brooklyn Police Sgt. William Tobin, Lepke believes he could be in for trouble unless he gets rid of those who may know too much, including many in the Brownsville Group - including Reles - and the Collinses. As their previous stance of cooperating with Reles and Lepke seems to get them in deeper and deeper, Joey and Eadie reevaluate what to do to save themselves.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Murder, Inc. was a B picture and I remember seeing it as a lad as the second part of a double bill back in the days when they had such things. As I was from Brooklyn the whole story of the gang was interesting to a 12 year old. Needless to say the neighborhood of Brownsville had changed quite a bit even in 1960 from 20 years earlier.The film is based on a book by the real Burton Turkus who must have consented to the dramatic license taken to bring the story of the taking down of Louis Lepke Burkhalter the only top crime boss to this day ever to get the death penalty. But the atmosphere of the Jewish neighborhood of Brownsville in Brooklyn is certainly captured as is the gang that made the place famous.The film's a good one, not great by any means, but decent enough entertainment performed by a cast that are well known as competent players, but no box office draws in this cast. But one of them really made his own career with this film.Peter Falk got the part of Abe 'Kid Twist' Reles who is one amoral example of humanity. Like Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano of more recent times in a career where he participated in a couple of dozen contract killings, when he's caught he offers to turn state's evidence. The end he met is part of gangland lore.What Falk did was turn in a performance that so impressed the critics that he got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Remember Murder, Inc. was a B film, released with no fanfare so to speak so Falk's performance got the acclaim it did strictly by word of mouth.The competition that year in this category was pretty good. The others who Falk was competing against were Jack Kruschen in The Apartment, Sal Mineo for Exodus, Chill Wills for The Alamo, and the eventual winner, Peter Ustinov for Spartacus. All of those others were high budget feature films with studios behind them with accompanying publicity machinery. Falk may have been there to round out the field, but just the fact he got there is an incredible tribute to his talent and that particular performance.Murder, Inc. was not Peter Falk's debut big screen performance, but it is the one that made his career. The rest of the cast which consists of such familiar faces as Stuart Whitman, May Britt, Eli Mintz, Morey Amsterdam, Simon Oakland and Henry Morgan as Burton Turkus perform well enough, but Peter Falk as Reles will never leave you.Talk about making one's own breaks.</p>
