He has no friends, has disowned his only living relative - his nephew Fred - and generally treats everyone he meets with extreme contempt. He particularly loathes Christmas, which he a sees as an excuse for picking a man's pocket once a year, and only reluctantly give his clerk, Bob Cratchit, the day off. On Christmas Eve however, he is visited by the ghost his long dead partner, Jacob Marley, who begs him to change his ways. Refusing to do so, he's told that three ghosts - the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and that which is Yet to Come - will visit him that night. In doing so, they show him what he has lost and what he will leave behind after he is gone unless he mends his ways.</p>
<p>An old bitter miser who makes excuses for his uncaring nature learns real compassion when three ghosts visit him on Christmas Eve.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of  a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule,  which is why this film always tends to buck the  trend.George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge  perfectly, fully encompassing all of his cold  tendencies, and still makes him a simpathetic  character. The production value for this film was  exceptional, never relying  on boffo special effects  or soundstage set-ups, yet relying on the depth  and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops.  A movie that certainly stands alone.</p>
