<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Manoogian's "Seedpeople" is a silly horror film about people being taken over by a plant monsters in a small town of Comet Valley.The action is slow-moving,the monsters are completely unscary and there is no gore.The film is a blatant copy of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers",so anyone who is looking for some new ideas will be disappointed.The monsters by John Carl Buechler are among the most laughable movie creatures in recent years.The script by Jackson Barr is truly lame and the direction by Peter Manoogian ("Demonic Toys","Eliminators") is not better.The film may be marginally entertaining,if you're in the right mood.My rating:5 out of 10 and that's being really generous.</p>
