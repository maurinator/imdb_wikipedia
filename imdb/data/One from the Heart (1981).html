<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hank and Frannie don't seem to be able to live together anymore. After a five-year relationship, lustful and dreamy Fanny leaves down-to-earth Hank on the anniversary of their relationship. Each one of them meets their dream mate, but as bright as they may seem, they are but a stage of lights and colours. Will true love prevail over a seemingly glamorous passion? Welcome to Coppola's Broadway-like romantic musical.</p>
<p>Las Vegas. It's the Fourth of July, and today marks five years since Hank and Frannie moved in together. They'd planned to celebrate, but instead they fight. Hank is a "stick-in-the-mud;" Frannie is a "flake." They break up, and, in no time Frannie meets a suave singer-waiter, and Hank meets a lovely circus performer. Time to find out just what Hank and Frannie's relationship is made of.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, this movie did absolutely horrible in theaters when it was released in 1982. I saw it about 1984 on disk (CED) and was surprised. Along with the weird lighting (it was filmed on a HUGE sound stage) and strange character reactions....something in this move touched me deeply. Along with all of it I found a kernal....a morsel......some real gem that made this otherwise trite movie quite rich. Rich enough I saw the movie again....and am considering purchase of a copy.Apparently I am one of the 5% who actually LIKED the movie....who didn't demand their ticket money back.We DO exist, you know....</p>
