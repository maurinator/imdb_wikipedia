<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In "Dark Victory" the lead goes blind and faces encroaching death. In "Bright Victory" the lead's already blind and faces encroaching life.The latter seems far more challenging.Arthur Kennedy's Oscar-nominated performance as Larry buoys this film from start to finish. His excellent naturalistic style is perfect for the returning disabled vet.Peggy Dow (as Judy) and Julie Adams (as Chris) are both fine as the women in Larry's life. The script is so sensitively written that both female characters are totally believable in their motivations.James Edwards delivers his usual solid work as Joe, Larry's best friend.Mark Robson's direction is efficient and level headed, and the photography, editing and music are all extremely tasteful.This is one of Authur Kennedy's finest hours, amongst a distinguished body of work during a most versatile career.</p>
