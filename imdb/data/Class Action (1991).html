<h1>Class Action (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jed Ward is an attorney who specializes in whistle blower, David vs. Goliath, type cases. He finds a client who is suing an auto company over a safety problem that has had a severe effect on his life after the accident. He must replace the current attorney and be ready for trial quickly, and then he finds that the defense attorney will be his estranged daughter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The idea, great. the actors, terrific.  The plot, solid.  the outcome, OK at best.   Class Action has its moments, but spends way too much time developing the father-daughter relationship.  Just as you get into the dirty dealings of the law firm, the director and editors give us more forced relationship.  This is worth a look, but only if on TV.</p>
