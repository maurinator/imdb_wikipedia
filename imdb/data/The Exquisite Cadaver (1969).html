<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A real surprise, this Vincent Aranda movie that plays more like a French movie. Uneasy narrative flow, many arty moments, different versions of the story unfold and reality not always something certain and a surreal edge. Indeed the main guy in this reminded me of Gaston Modot who starred in L'Age D'Or - he seemed to hold his jaw the same way and move with that slightly awkward motion akin to a lurch. Everyone performs well and helps this sometimes demanding movie always compelling and memorable. The English actress, Judy Matherson is excellent as the mysterious girl with a death wish who only appears in flashbacks. Strange to think that the same year she made this she also appeared in an episode of Coronation Street. Indeed after this and a few Hammer movies she returned to TV. Aranda made the equally compelling, Blood Spattered Bride after this and I recall that too having a similar dream like quality. There is an amazing scene involving a fridge but as I've resisted this long, I won't give it away now.</p>
