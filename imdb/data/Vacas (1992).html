<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw Vacas at the Mill Valley Film Festival before its general release and thought then that it was one of the most exceptional films I had ever seen.If you have the opportunity to view it, you are in for a rare visual and story treat.Since it failed to make general US release in 1991, I have been searching for a VCR/DVD copy of it, with at the least English subtitles, in order to share it with others. If anyone knows where to obtain such a copy, please let me know. TIA!!</p>
