<h1>The She Beast (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>by Michael Reeves starring Barbara Steele and Mel Welles. Made in 1966 for about forty thousand dollars, filmed in Italy and set in contemporary Transylvania, The She-Beast is an early work from promising young English writer-director Michael Reeves and features the very lovely and talented Barbara Steele. Two good reasons to watch the film and overlook its low budget and dubbing problems. Its only real fault is that a role that I would have been perfect for went to, um, someone else.</p>
