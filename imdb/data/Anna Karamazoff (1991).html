<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am very impressed after seeing this authentic and historical movie. I was interested in the film particularly as some Moscow underground icons were acting in it. You can see Pyutor Mamonov (Zvuki Mu and real star of psychedelic new wave in Russia), Boris Raskolnikov (very good guitar player and the founder of underground club Tretiy Put) and Alexei Tegin (dark wave shaman) in episodes of this brilliant noir , psychedelic surrealism. I can assure you that this film is a monument of the early days of Russian psychedelic revolution back in 90s.It includes very special atmosphere, great suspense, hallucinative and provocative visionary, the mood of 20s silent films and a lot of old mansions in Moscow, filmed in really avangard way. www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab</p>
