<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't think I would like this movie and I actually only watched it because I am a huge Anthony Michael Hall fan but it did end up surprising me with how into it I became.The plot line is very generic.. or would be since a lot more movies have been made like it since then but the acting and directing of the movie is very good and still pulls you into it.Anthony Michael Halls acting is once again flawless and natural, it just shows how great his range of abilities is as an actor. The female lead annoyed me a bit but that's just my opinion.. i found her voice annoying.Overall a great movie with great acting. 7/10 just because I didn't like the gore in it, it's very minimum but if your queasy be guarded.</p>
