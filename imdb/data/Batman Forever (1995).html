<h1>Batman Forever (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Dark Knight of Gotham City confronts a dastardly duo: Two-Face and the Riddler. Formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent, Two-Face incorrectly believes Batman caused the courtroom accident which left him disfigured on one side; he has unleashed a reign of terror on the good people of Gotham. Edward Nygma, computer-genius and former employee of millionaire Bruce Wayne, is out to get the philanthropist; as The Riddler he perfects a device for draining information from all the brains in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's knowledge of his other identity. Batman/Wayne is/are the love focus of Dr. Chase Meridan. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner Robin the Boy Wonder.</p>
<p>Batman finds that he must protect Gotham City once again from the combined forces of villains Two-Face and the Riddler. Two Face is also former District Attorney Harvey Dent who was accidentally disfigured in a courtroom incident. The Riddler is former Wayne Tech employee Edward Nygma who is bent on getting revenge for a refused project. Now they join forces to drain the brainwaves of each citizen in Gotham while plotting revenge on Batman. While Batman/Bruce Wayne struggles to fight the dastardly duo, he must also deal with a romantic relationship with a sexy psychologist and the eagerness of a new young ward who becomes his new sidekick Robin.</p>
<p>Batman's third film follows the practice of the second by giving him two villains to face, Two-Face and the Riddler. Two-Face blames Batman for his disfigurement and simply wishes him dead. The Riddler is a disgruntled inventor who worked for Wayne Enterprises and is terribly jealous of Wayne's success and sophistication and uses his riddles to show his superiority over Wayne and Batman. Added to this mix are a sexy abnormal psychologist who is not only studying the criminals, but has a thing for Batman as well and Dick Grayson, (Robin) is introduced. Gotham is still a dark and foreboding place in which Batman begins to come to grips with his own psychology as he relives the deaths of his parents in his dreams.</p>
<p>The caped crusader returns to fight Two-Face and The Riddler, whilst pursuing the lovely Chase Meridian. Trusty superhero sidekick Robin makes his first appearance in this movie series. Two-Face just wants Batman dead and The Riddler is happy to help him.</p>
<p>DA Harvey Dent is hideously scarred down one side, by an acid attack. The result is 2 personalities and 2 faces. Ideal qualifications for a politician you might think, but Two-face's only policy is vengeance on Batman. He teams up with Edward Nygma, a technical wizard who invents a brain-sucking TV and adopts the alto-ego of The Riddler. Meanwhile... in the circus, Dick Grayson witnesses his acrobat family plummet earthwards and get a taste for sawdust. Two-face is to blame but Dick trades his anger for a rubber suit and becomes Robin. Two bad guys, two good guys and 8 persona's.</p>
<p>Batman is back. This time, he faces several challenges. Harvey Dent (Alias Two-Face) who had acid thrown on his face, Edward Nygma (Alias The Riddler) who has invented a device that manipulates human brainwaves and transfers them into his own head, Dr. Chace Maridian, who has a major crush on him and not much his alter-ego Bruce Wayne, and Dick Grayson (Alias Robin), who lost his family at the hands of Two-Face and is taken in by Wayne. Batman, now must train Dick Grayson and confront both Two-Face and The Riddler to save Gotham City.</p>
<p>Batman must battle Two-Face and The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must admit that I was biased before I'd even seen this movie back in 1995. I was biased because I just didn't expect it to be any good due to the absence of Michael Keaton.When I did watch it I thought it was okay. Val Kilmer did his best as Bruce Wayne although he just looked a bit too young to play a millionaire playboy-but he did do a good job.Finally we saw the debut of Robin. I thought Robin's costume was cool-it was updated for the 1990's.Once again the villains stole the show. Jim Carrey (a truly funny man) made a great Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones made a superb Two Face.Nicole Kidman made a great love interest for Batman but I would have liked to see more interaction between them in the film.Whilst I think the first two Batman films were the best, I have no problem in recommending this film to any Batman fan.</p>
