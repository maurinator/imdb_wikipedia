<h1>Jinnah (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Biography of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of modern Pakistan is told through flashbacks as his soul tries to find eternal rest. The flashbacks start in 1947 as Jinnah pleads for a separate nation from the Muslim regime, infuriating Lord Mountbatten. Mountbatten then tries to enlist Gandhi & Nehru to persuade Jinnah to stop his efforts. Gandhi sides with Jinnah, which upsets Nehru. However, Jinnah turns down the offer to become prime minister and the film takes another slide back to 1916, which reveals all of the political implications that have occurred.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film is very good and brings out the best about Jinnah- a leader who sacrificed his home, family and love for his people. A must watch for every person who believes in freedom, equality and justice for mankind. I would recommend this film to every person, Pakistani or not. Also show this to your children, to make them understand the true virtues of a gentleman, an honest, brave and selfless leader. As Stanley Wolpert wrote in his book ' Jinnah of Pakistan', "Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Mohammad Ali Jinnah did all three."When ever you feel low and doubt your capabilities, sit down and watch this great movie. It will make you believe that honesty, integrity of character and determination can work wonders.</p>
