<h1>Birds Do It (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Melvin Byrd, who dreams of being a scientist, is a Cape Kennedy "miniscule molecular particle surveillance monitor" - in short, a janitor. His job is to keep a major rocket project completely dust-free, and this he does with his own hilariously fantastic inventions - including a literal attack on dirt by a "knight on a white horse". In his work, he meets Judy, a chimp involved in a top-secret project, which leads Melvin into the one room strictly off-limits to him. Not until he has entered the project room does Melvin learn that any man entering it will be negatively ionized - making him fly like a bird.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a waste of a very good legendary comedian! The writing in this movie is so poor and weak that it is insipid instead of amusing. Soupy spends about a third of the movie flying around in the sky, actually more like floating up like a balloon and then having no control of how to go where he'd like to go. This gets very boring very quickly and he just alternately keeps trying to look either frightened when heading for danger or else he looks happy in spite of his inability to control where he's going. There are a group of bad guys who keep trying to kill him for some reason which is never really explained. Soupy is only supposed to be a mere janitor anyway, so why the fuss? Tab Hunter plays dual roles as both an army soldier and also one of the bad guys, who just happens to look exactly like somebody else on the NASA space ship base. What are the chances of that? Anyway, Tab does his best but nothing can save this turkey of a movie. I found a copy of this movie on eBay, but it isn't available otherwise. Probably the other copies of it were tossed into the garbage. I was really trying to enjoy this movie and hoping that it would get better, but it never did.</p>
