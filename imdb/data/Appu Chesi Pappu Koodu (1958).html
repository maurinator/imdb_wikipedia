<h1>Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1958)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the best Telugu film on the portraying the other side of persons who try to help themselves out of borrowing. Difficulties of persons who borrow without proper planning and bury themselves up to their neck are beautifully and most hilariously pictured. The film is a slap on the face of such persons. It is a film filled with all the varieties like humor, love, family bondage, devotion and good character. Each character is portrayed to symbolize a particular human nature. The conflict and emotion of a good person not to cheat others and stay straight forward is beautifully displayed. One cannot stop watching the film once started. The music, screenplay and direction are at its best. The cast aptly suited for the character. You will identify the character and forget the cast. Simply, this film of Vijaya Productions directed by L V Prasad is one of the best Telugu films.</p>
