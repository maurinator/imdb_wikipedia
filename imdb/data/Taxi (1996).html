<h1>Taxi (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young girl, after failing an exam, is forced by her father, a taxi-driver, to learn his profession. Soon she discovers that her father is not only a driver but also a member of a racist group eliminating immigrants, homosexual, transvestite, etc. people. She also falls in love with a boy, also a taxi-driver and a "socio" of the group.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A frightening tale of racism and resurgent fascism in Madrid in the late '90s. Essential viewing for people interested in the 'New Europe" and all the baggage that comes with it. The movie presents no answers, just observations...I saw it late one night on irish TV - dunno if it's available on video.</p>
