<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It isn't often a great talent is properly packaged in the guise of a man, most people would not give a second look. Yet, when the popular comedy duo of Martin and Lewis broke up, the worry centered on Dean Martin. Jerry Lewis on the other hand was so multi-talented, no one gave much though that he would succeed. This exceptional comedian assembled his talent and created movies like this one. It's called " The Patsy " and tells the story of Standley Belt (Jerry Lewis) a virtual no-body who is selected by a group of agents, trainers and talent specialists to replace their lost meal ticket. The problem which is central to the group is that Standley possesses little or no natural talent and despite the best trainers,seems doomed to failure. Jerry Lewis wrote, directed and starred in this grand production which includes top name actors. Ina Balin, plays Ellen Betz, the one person in the group who does care for Standley's success. Of course there are others like Everett Sloane, Phil Harris, Keenan Wynn, Peter Lorre, John Carradine, Richard Deacon and of course the late great Hans Conried. Together, under the auspices of Jerry, this film become one of a dozen triumphs. With Lewis as the Patsy, it has becomes a Classic. ****</p>
