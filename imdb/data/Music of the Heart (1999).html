<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>... is this film worth anything.  Ms Streep's understated performance, of course, is brilliant.  The rest of the film is a waste of time.  The story of a suburban, ex-navy wife putting together a violin chorus because she "needs a job" is hard to believe.  I know, I know, this is based on a true story but it rambles on like predictable, made-for-tv schlock.  Certainly the real story has to be more compelling than this film.The only reason to see this movie is, of course, Meryl Streep!</p>
