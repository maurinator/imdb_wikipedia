<h1>In the Name of the Father (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The premiere episode ushers in the drama as the newest housewives, Melissa (Teresa's sister-in-law) and Kathy (Teresa's cousin) prepare for a family christening. Jacqueline's feeling of guilt and frustration boil over when her lunch with Ashley goes sour. A baby's blessed day becomes a nightmare when Teresa and her family arrive at the reception.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Of the five New Jersey housewives, only one is non-Italian and that is Jacqueline Laurita but she's married to an Italian-American Christopher Laurita whose sisters are the former Dina Laurita Manzo and the present Caroline Laurita Manzo. I have to say without Danielle. This show now has some kind of balance between two families--Teresa's and Caroline's. So far, Teresa's family includes her sister-in-law Melissa and her cousin, Kathy. Their third season opener is a whopper. Melissa and her husband, Joe (Teresa's brother) hold a christening reception at the expensive upscale Manor in West Orange, New Jersey. There is a brawl of course which can help explain Teresa's erratic behavior. Anyway this episode has clearly showed Bravo's sudden disdain for the Manzos by putting them in the backseat. The Manzo family dinner seemed too staged, phony, and pretentious. Caroline's adult sons have finally rented a two bedroom apartment in trendy Hoboken which is an expensive place to live. Both boys have decided to leave the Brownstone and pursue other interests. Well, Bravo, because that place seems to have a hold on them. Anyway without the Danielle nonsense, the Manzos are boring almost generic for reality television. Explain how a high school dropout GED graduate like Ashley with a felony on her record lands a cushy internship with the infamous Lizzy Grubmann when there are thousands of better qualified candidates for the position. Oh I forgot, she's on a reality show. Then Ashley has the nerve to say she wants to live in the city rather than commute for an hour a day for unpaid internship. How many would kill for that internship opportunity? There are lots of even college educated students who would jump at the chance and never complain or show up late ever but they don't get it. Ashley is still a spoiled brat and hasn't learned anything since last year. Without Danielle, the tensions arise on Teresa's side of the family. With Teresa and her husband, Joe, filing for bankruptcy to avoid creditors and their spending habits, Teresa's brother Joe and his wife, Melissa join the cast along with cousin Kathy. Now I see the writing on the wall, I guess the Manzos are going to take a backseat for the Gorga-Giudice drama. But I amazed that the Italian Americans in this country aren't more appalled by this mature group of adults with spouses and children who often make the Jersey Shore cast look like a Mensa group meeting.</p>
