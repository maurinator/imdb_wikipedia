<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a wonderful film. It is both creative and heartfelt and truly well done. I loved the reindeer they were great. this film shows that there art still film makers out there who believe in mankind enough to create movies that show the better side of this world not the evil most film makers seem to harp on. We buy this film on DVD and it will become a Chritmas tradition. It would be refreshing to see more of this type of film with morals that show that there is still enough good people out there that take the time to make a difference by creating films of value and what life should be like.With all the nonsense that we face every day and the world we live in we need to see the better side of life.The only negative comment I have is the fact the little girl Kate has pierced ears and should not have. Kids back then did not do that until they were at least 16( Iknow it is just a little detail but I find those things take away from the film it is the little details that can make or brake a film.It is more pleasing to watch something that is well thought out including all details) On the whole my family and friends loved this film and hope there are more out there. Thanks</p>
