<h1>Monster in the Closet (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Monster is a spoof of horror/monster films. After several people and a dog are found dead in their closets a "mild-mannered" reporter, a college professor, her son and a befuddled professor band together to uncover the mystery but not without involving the U.S. Army and mass panic.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Spoof of many sci-fi movies. Creature itself is reminiscent of the creature in Alien. Also reminds me a little of the creature in Pumpkinhead. Much less 'real' looking in appearance. Spoof of the movie Psycho shower scene. As the monster walks down the street, a military man yells 'bombs, tanks, planes, nothing...' which is a spoof of War of the Worlds as our weapons proved useless against the invaders. The kindly professor, Henry Gibson, attempts to communicate using a xylophone, playing the musical notes from the famous scene of Close Encounters of a Third Kind. The creature seems to respond by extending and retracting its inner 'Alien' type mouth in and out to the beat of the xylophone. When we learn that the existence of closets give this creature energy, we are all told to destroy all closets. This is a great scene, as people all over the world are tearing their closets to pieces. Good for laughs. Not serious at all.</p>
