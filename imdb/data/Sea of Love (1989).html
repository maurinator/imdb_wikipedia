<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Within a kind of light and shadow there's almost a trademark photography for a film noir movie, and "Sea of Love" is a film that takes place in the shadows Al Pacino plays Frank Teller, a self-conscious detectivein search of a serial killerdrawn into a torrid sexual relationship with an attractive young woman he met in a super market when all the good citizens of the city are asleep and the people who are walking around are the ones who are leading the most solitary lives Helen Barkin is just so right for the part You can believe her when you see her dressed in her red leather jacket and tight jeans She's a lady of the night, sexy as hell, and a woman who can take care of herself Between her and Pacino, there were enough attraction that's deep but also there were feelings of vulnerability and suspicion</p>
