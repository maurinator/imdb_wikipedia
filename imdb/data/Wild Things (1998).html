<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Magnificent storyline. While the basic storyline of what was happening was so simple it was so original as well. All the twists and turns kept you interested throughout the movie which is what people really want to see from a movie, not something that drags on and on about nothing and then finishes with the same kind of ending that every other movie does. Neve Campbell played a different type of role to what she's used to but did it very well. Matt Dillon (playing Sam Lambardo) was excellent although the role could have been cast slightly better maybe with George Clooney. Kevin Bacon gave another stellar performance and kept you interested in his role throughout the movie. But without a doubt the the best performance was Denise Richards who was absolutely perfect for the role. She couldn't have been cast better from anyone in the world. Her beauty made this movie what it was. I think a lot of people would consider Matt Dillon the luckiest man in the world.</p>
