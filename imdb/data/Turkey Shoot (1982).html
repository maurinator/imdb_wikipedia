<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Set in the near future, the world is dominated by a strictly malevolent society that throws 'social deviants' who don't conform with these rules into maximum-security behaviour modification camps. The latest arrivals to the camp warden Thatcher's terror camp are the spirited fighter Paul Anders, the uneasy Chris Walters and the game Rita Daniels. Things are tough going and gruelling cruel, but they are given a chance of freedom. That's if they take part in a survival hunt called the "Turkey Shoot", where they would be released if they survive the twenty-four hours.The Australian production "Turkey Shoot" was a complete hoot (or for some a shocker)! This unsparingly cheapjack action exploitation crossed horror / sci-fi fare only has one thing on mind - crass entertainment. Everything about it is on the fast track and there's hardly any thought of letting up. Despite being a ultra-campy and sadistically violent variant of "The Most Dangerous Game" and George Orwell's "1984" theme, the deranged premise is downright silly as they seem play it straight. There's nothing really to work off it as it rather one-dimensional material. The cheekily black subject matter isn't much of a satire (which from the original script sounded like it could've been), but its hokey dialogues, ghastly splatter and outrageously impulsive actions make this schlock highly watchable. Especially one worthy head explosion! The array of performances were suitable for this type of film. Olivia Hussy looks mopish, but definitely petrified (she wasn't just acting if you watch the DVD extras), but fits the bill. Steve Railsback is rather intense in the heroine role and buxom Lynda Stoner makes the most out of her character. A classy Michael Craig is strikingly serviceable as the strenuously cold-blooded camp warden Thatcher. Roger Ward is superb as the devilishly brutal right hand Chief Guard Ritter and Carmen Duncan is terrifically vindictive with that crossbow as one of bloodthirsty hunters. Noel Ferrier, Bill Young and a twitchy John Ley make up the rest of the support cast. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith boldly goes all out and throws caution to the wind with snappy pacing, truck-load of pyrotechnics and flair to boot. He does an exceptional job with the hassles and pressures that shaped and lurked on this hazarded product. The picture perfect location (shot in the North Queensland) of the vast sprawling landscape adds another element to the mixture and Brian May's uncannily throbbing electronic music score gels with on-going scenes and moods.Hearing all the troubles that disrupted this project (like budget chops, the film's production time being cut short, the opening part of script being erased and uncomfortable actors) it could have been some thing of decent quality. Anyhow you can only do with what you got and its welcoming trash that's not trying to be anything else. That's the best way to take this diverting turkey.</p>
