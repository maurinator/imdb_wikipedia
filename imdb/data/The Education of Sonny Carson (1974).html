<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A gifted young man is caught up in gang life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie represents an important historical documentary of a great revolutionary activist and freedom fighter Abubadika Sonny Carson. His-story represents an example and reminder that we must never join forces with those who believe that youth that have lost their way should be tossed away like so many pieces of garbage. In every youth there lives a Sonny Carson and it is up to each of us to help each of them find that spirit perhaps laying dormant in themselves. Once our youth find that revolutionary spirit in themselves they will be able to rise from the ashes of self-destructiveness and take their places as builders and protectors of the community. Fathers share this story and movie with your sons show them the trans-formative power of revolutionary activism. Challenge them play their role in uplifting our community.</p>
