<h1>The In-Laws (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In preparation for his daughter's wedding, dentist Sheldon Kornpett meets Vince Ricardo, the groom's father. Vince, a manic fellow who claims to be a government agent, then proceeds to drag Sheldon into a series of chases and misadventures from New York to Central America.</p>
<p>A mild mannered dentist is about to marry off his daughter but he's never met the boy's father. When the father of the groom comes to dinner, he brings with him weird behavior and an international plot that involves stolen plates for U.S. Currency. This is bad enough, but it occurs to him that no one would be suspicious of a dentist and he begins to ask for a few favors that have people trying to kill our hero.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>peter faulk and alan arkin make a great comedy,team, because they counterbalance each other. With a great script and a very funny adjoining cast of characters, arkin and falk takes us to a various locales and absurd locations to show a great talent of comedic timing between the two of them one being a dentist and the other, a character of enigmatic qualities. Have to see this one.</p>
