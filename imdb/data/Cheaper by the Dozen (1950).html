<h1>Cheaper by the Dozen (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"Cheaper By the Dozen", based on the real-life story of the Gilbreth family, follows them from Providence, Rhode Island to Montclair, New Jersey, and details the amusing anecdotes found in large families. Frank Gilbreth, Sr., was a pioneer in the field of motion study, and often used his family as guinea pigs (with amusing and sometimes embarrassing results). He resisted popular culture,railing against his daughters' desires for bobbed hair and cosmetics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While some might be critical of this movie for being "overly cheerful and sappy", I find "Cheaper by the Dozen" and movies like it of their time a haven in today's sexualized, blow 'em up assortment of trash.  This movie is pure entertainment.  You don't have to think.  Just sit back, laugh and enjoy.</p>
