<h1>A Few Good Men (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this dramatic courtroom thriller, LT Daniel Kaffee, a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague. Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a "CODE RED". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.</p>
<p>At Guantanamo Marine Base, a private is attacked by 2 other marines and dies as a result. An investigation is conducted by Lt. Commander Jo Galloway and reveals to her superiors that she believes that the private was attacked by because he was going over the head of Colonel Jessup, the base commander and was threatening to reveal something unless he gets a transfer, so Jessup ordered a "code red" which is basically a type hazing done which is not legal. Galloway wants to be assigned to defend the 2 marines but her superior prefers that the whole go away quietly so he denies her request and has the case assigned to Lt. Dan Kaffee, a Naval lawyer who hasn't tried a case in court and prefers to plea his cases out. But Galloway warns him that if he pleads the case out, Jessup will get away with murder. Kaffee decides not to plead the case out and tries to defend them but there's no proof that Jessup actually gave the order.</p>
<p>Subpar Guantanomo Bay marine PFC William Santiago mysteriously died after his platoon mates Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and PFC Landon Downy give him a "code red." The two are charged with his murder and Liutentent Daniel Kaffee is assigned lead defense counsel on the case. Assisting Kaffe on the case are Liutentent Sam Weinberg and Liutentent Commander Joanne Galloway. On the opposing side are Crn. Nathan Jessup, a harsh marine with something to hide, and Johnothan Kendrick, Santiago's strict and suspicious platoon commander. the movie follows the struggle for Kaffee, Golloway, and Weinberg to prove their client's innocence against the prosecution.</p>
<p>The facts: Guantanamo Bay, Cuba - Gitmo as it is known - based marines Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey assaulted Private William Santiago in the middle of the night, which included stuffing a rag into his mouth, Santiago who died shortly thereafter of respiratory complications. Special Judge Advocate Counsel Lieutenant Joanne Galloway believes Dawson and Downey were just following orders, as part of the marine's unofficial "code red" where there is self policing within the ranks, and that there was no intent of murder. Galloway, a naive lawyer who seeks fairness and justice at all cost, wants to be assigned the case but she has no trial experience. Instead, the military assigns Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee to be Dawson and Downey's counsel. Kaffee is a lightweight lawyer who also has no trial experience and has a history of taking, as Galloway refers, the path of least resistance by plea bargaining regardless of his clients' guilt/innocence and their wants. Galloway becomes co-counsel in the case. The two, with their assistant Lieutenant Sam Weinberg, have to decide what to do, not an easy task considering their differing views on law and what is best for all including themselves. They do believe Dawson and Downey's story that they were following unofficial/official code red orders, but are uncertain if their case is winnable, especially against the marine machine run by Gitmo's Colonel Nathan Jessep.</p>
<p>Neo military lawyer Kaffee defends Marines accused of murder; they contend they were acting under orders.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this movie kicks.  it's one of my favorites.  i like courtroom drama, and in my opinion, this is the best courtroom movie ever.  i love the part when tom cruise, during his redirect, asks noah wyle how he knows where the mess hall is if it isn't in the marine guidebooks. is that a great scene or what?  and of course the climax, when cruise has JACK on the stand, is exhilarating to watch, even after repeated viewings.  nichalson may be slightly over the top as colonel jessup, but that's why he's so good in this movie.  kieffer sutherland is perfect as kendrick.  and of course i have to mention jt walsh as markinson, just because i think walsh was a great character actor, and he'll always be one of my favorites.  my score-10.</p>
