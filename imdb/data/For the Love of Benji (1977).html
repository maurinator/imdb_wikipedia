<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a great movie. No action, no swearing, no gore, just a wonderful family movie with that lovable dog, Benji. The story seems unlikely and impossible, but who cares? I don't. It makes you appreciate whatever pet you have. Wheter it be a dog, a cat, a bird, a fish, etc. Like other Benji movies, his one is fun to watch and should be seen with the family, including the family pet. Thumbs up!</p>
