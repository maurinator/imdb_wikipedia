<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are looking for something very funny this movie is worth the time.  Don't be turned off by the overall low rating.  This movie is very lighthearted fun and that's all it tries to be.  It's biggest problem is some poor story line editing. The story line could have been streamlined to avoid some bumps.  Chris Klein is is Chris Klein ... meaning he is the same character that he's always been in movies such as Election and American Pie.  Personally I like this character. Heather Graham's acting was weak.  I don't know if it was her script or just her approach to the character.  She was unimpressive.  I just don't think she was cut out for this role.  However Sally Field was fantastic as usual.  Her skills greatly added to this movie and really made up for Ms. Grahams weak performance.  Orlando Jones was great as was Richard Jenkins.The bottom line here is that this movie is funny and worth watching if that's what you are seeking. Its two main flaws are the editing and Heather Grahams performance or casting.  If they could have improved those two things I think this movie could have been as high as an 8.</p>
