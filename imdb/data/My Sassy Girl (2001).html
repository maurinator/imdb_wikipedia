<h1>My Sassy Girl (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a series of true stories posted by Ho-sik Kim on the Internet describing his relationship with his girlfriend. These were later transformed into a best-selling book and the movie follows the book closely. It describes the meeting of Kyun-woo (Cha) and an unnamed girl. Kyun-woo is shamed into assisting the girl because the other passengers mistakenly think she is his girlfriend. Once he helps her, Kyun-woo develops a deep sense of responsibility for her which enables him to tolerate (somehow) the girl's abuses.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is 15 minutes longer, so the movies reaches 2 hour 15 minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these 2 are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be 2 normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!10/10</p>
