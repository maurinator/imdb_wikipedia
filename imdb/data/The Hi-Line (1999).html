<h1>The Hi-Line (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A scam artist convinces a naive young woman in Whitman, Montana, that she is to be given a job by a major Chicago discount store. However, her dad and mom see through the ruse and tries to have him run out of town. At this point, the man confesses that he has a letter from a man who recently died in prison. The letter indicates that the young woman was fathered by him and a woman named Estelle and was placed in this couple's care, which they are forced to admit. This leads the young woman into a search for her real mother, who it turns out is a Blackfoot woman living in the "Hi-Line", a desolate area in Montana.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>the Hi-Line is a small simple narrative of two damaged souls caught up in a delicate dance of approach and avoidance in an original love story. Set against the bleak, wintry backdrop of a small town in northern Montana, this story is tender and truthful and completely unpredictable. The closing scene in the ballroom of Chicago's Drake Hotel is memorable, poetic and touching, a magic movie moment Rachel Leigh Cook and Ryan Alosio are wonderful.</p>
