<h1>Henry Fool (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Socially inept garbage man Simon is befriended by Henry Fool, a witty roguish, but talentless novelist. Henry opens a magical world of literature to Simon who turns his hand to writing the 'great American poem'. As Simon begins his controversial ascent to the dizzying heights of Nobel Prize winning poet, Henry sinks to a life of drinking in low-life bars. The two friends fall out and lose touch until Henry's criminal past catches up with him and he needs Simon's help to flee the country.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you like a movie that is character driven, you'll love Henry Fool which was written and directed by Hal Hartley.  This movie abounds with interesting, quirky characters.  The leads, Mr. Ryan, the title character, and Mr. Urbaniak, were terrific.  The plot, where the teacher/student or leader/follower is reversed during the course of the story is not unique but is presented well.  The other characters, Ms. Posey and Mr. Corrigan, undergo significant development as well.  I don't want to give away too much but I will say that this movie involves characters that are not politically correct and bathroom humor (literally).  The movie is long but you won't notice it as the movie is rich with dialogue (listen carefully), constantly changing scenes, and as already stated well developed chang ing characters.  I've deliberately avoided the plot until now because I was afraid I would say too much, but it involves a drif ter writer (and much more) Henry Fool who encourages a plain introverted garbage man, Simon, to write down his thoughts. The other characters Ms. Posey, Simon's sister, his mother, and Mr. Corrigan, thug patriot(?) are interesting as well.  My thanks to all involved for a great afternoon's entertainment.  Three plus stars.</p>
