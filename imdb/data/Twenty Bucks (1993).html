<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Twenty Bucks" focuses on a $20 bill getting passed around from person to person, and how we get to see the people's lives: a man whose travels have consisted of a trip to the bowling alley, a drug dealer hosting a summer camp, some crooks plotting a robbery, and some people's attempts at relationships. It's a lighthearted but authentic look at the world of today (well, the world of 1993). And it always shows how people are determined to keep going no matter what happens.Does the movie have any problems? Maybe some of the characters' lives work out too conveniently. But that really doesn't drag the movie down at all. They did a very good job with this movie, and I recommend it. Starring Linda Hunt, Brendan Fraser, Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, Steve Buscemi and William H. Macy (happy birthday, William!).</p>
