<h1>Happy Anniversary (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Living in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of New York City, working class lawyer Chris Walters and his wife, the former Alice Ganz, are celebrating their thirteenth anniversary in wedded bliss with their two children, Ockie and Debbie. On the anniversary day, Chris and Alice even decide on the spur of the moment to recreate a romantic tryst they had from years earlier. The only major disagreement Chris and Alice seem to have in their life is on the presence or not of a television set in the house, Chris who believes one will ruin the family dynamic. Things for the Walters take a turn for the worse when first Alice's parents buy their daughter and son-in-law a television set as a gift, and second, while in a drunken stupor at the anniversary party, Chris divulges a secret to Alice's parents that was kept solely between Alice and himself for fourteen years. Both incidents result in an argument between Chris and Alice. Going from bad to worse, daughter Debbie believes her parents may be headed for a divorce. It's not that information which causes the major problems for Chris and Alice, but rather the way they find out. Their marriage may not be able to survive these arising issues.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Happy Anniversary which was known as Anniversary Waltz on Broadway had a good 611 performance run on Broadway in 1954-55 season. Authored by Jerome Chodorov who was having blacklist problems in Hollywood it finally made it to the big screen in 1959 probably for that reason. But the delay knocked the props out of the big gag of the play.David Niven and Mitzi Gaynor after 13 years of marriage and 14 year of kanoodling with two kids to show for it are having some wear and tear on the marriage. A big issue is Niven's old fashioned views on television, he hates it and won't have it in his house. In 1954 a lot of people still didn't own a set. But by 1959 when I was 12 years old just about every family did. It was the major medium of entertainment and news and the two hadn't quite blended yet. Niven was not funny, in fact he was downright ludicrous.And heavens to Betsy he actually admits that he and Gaynor were kanoodling even before it became official. That gets a good row going with her parents.Gaynor got to sing a song in the film while she and Niven were dancing on their anniversary. Musicals were rapidly disappearing and good thing she got a number in here. But Happy Anniversary will not go down as a great David Niven or Mitzi Gaynor film.</p>
