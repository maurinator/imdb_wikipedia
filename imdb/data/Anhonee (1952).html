<h1>Anhonee (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lucknow-based impoverished advocate, Rajkumar Saxena, complains to his landlord about the deplorable condition of his apartment but is instead told by the latter's daughter, Roop, to pay his outstanding rent for over 6 months or face legal action. He approaches her father, Harnam Singh, who not only lets him live there for free, but also befriends him, and invites him to Roop's birthday party. Roop gets impressed when he sings there and invites him for dinner along with her father. Before he could attend, he is asked to represent a courtesan client, Mohini, who is facing eviction by her landlord. He finds her resemblance to Roop quite unusual and mentions this during their dinner. This news apparently shocks Harnam, who gets hospitalized and subsequently passes away. Mohini, who is injured in an accident, retains him to sue Roop as she claims to be her sister, but the latter decides to let Mohini move in with her and share the estate. The latter's satisfaction will turn to bitterness when she finds out that Rajkumar shuns her and loves Roop while a former patron of Mohini, Shyam Sunder Laddan, prepares to blackmail both sisters.</p>
<p>Roop, a wealthy heiress, learns that she has a half-sister, Mohini, who grew up in the city's red-light district. She invites her into her home and insists that she shares everything she has. She doesn't mean the invitation to include her fianc√©, the handsome Rajkumar. Mohini has other ideas. The two women look identical and when Roop realises that Mohini has fallen in love, she decides to sacrifice her own happiness in order to atone for her father's sins.</p>
<p>An impoverished advocate faces challenges after he falls in love with a wealthy woman who has a look-alike courtesan sister.</p>
