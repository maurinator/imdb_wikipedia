<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Awhile ago FMC was showing this film a lot, so I had an opportunity to watch it.I found it rather difficult to watch this film all the way through. The acting was uninspired, the story was weak, and overall it just dragged.There were moments that were intended to be humorous that just fell flat. The actors don't seem interested in giving there all here for the most part. Maria Xenia makes some effort, but given the weak script there is little she could do.I do think that it could have been interesting had there been a little more focus on the Olympics aspect and less on Mansfield's character attempting to seduce Colton's character. The seduction falls flat on screen. And it seems the actors are just embarrassing themselves.</p>
