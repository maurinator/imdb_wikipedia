<h1>La Promesse (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Igor--a 15-year-old apprentice mechanic--spends his off hours at the beck and call of his father. Igor's father, Roger, is a low-life involved with smuggling illegal immigrants into Belgium, and acts as their slumlord, housing them in barely livable conditions, and paying them menial wages to work construction on his building (among other scams). When the building inspector pays a surprise visit and Amidou falls off a scaffold in his hurry to hide, things start to unravel, particularly when Igor makes a promise to the injured Amidou that ultimately exposes the different values of Igor and Roger, and of Amidou's wife, Assita.</p>
<p>Roger uses his son Igor to ruthlessly traffic and exploit illegal aliens. When one of the aliens is killed, Igor is guilt-ridden and wants to care for the dead man's family against his father's orders.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>LA PROMESSE is a coming of age story of sorts.  The young teenaged protagonist works for his father, who loves him deeply.  The father is sleazy exploiter of illegal aliens, and the boy is learning the trade of preying on the defenseless of society that includes theft from the elderly and extortion from the immigrants.  And it seems to be suiting him just fine until he helps his father cover up a fatal accident at his construction site.  The accident that did not have to be fatal, but the father does not want to risk the scrutiny of the authorities.  The boy promises the dying immigrant that he will take care of the man's wife and baby.  Slowly the youth begins to question his and his father's morality.Shot in a documentary style without music score, the urban Antwerp setting as well as the story are uniformly gray and grim.  Nonetheless this is an excellent film that tells a terrific moral tale to which there are no easy answers.  An excellent rental.</p>
