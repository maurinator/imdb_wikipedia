<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>By the time the film was over, I was asking myself why anyone would want to make this movie? I only kept watching because Joanna Pacula kept getting naked, a poor excuse for watching any movie. The plot involves a woman who "loves" two men, her husband and her lover. The husband and wife have an understanding that they can sleep around, and an agreement to keep the other one informed about all the details. I suppose the writer and director can dream about such an arrangement, but a film on it is completely unworkable. Gee, the husband gets jealous; what a surprise. Gee, the lover is an S&M brute, and the wife loves/hates it; what a surprise. I say, we should just all sleep around and NOT tell our mates. And, of course, refrain from making a movie about such a common and mundane experience. It gets a rating above a "1" only because there have been worse movies made, and we need to reserve something for them.</p>
