<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is another film by the great Bimal Roy. Based on Sarat Chandra's famous Bengali novel "Debdas", "Devdas" (1955) is one of Bimal Roy's handful of films that are adaptations of Bengali novels and short stories; others include "Parineeta" (1953) and "Kabuliwallah" (1960). In comparison with its successor "Devdas" (2002), Bimal Roy's "Devdas" (1955) provides a more realistic backdrop. The buildings, such as Devdas' and Paro's houses as well as the brothel in which Chandramukhi dances are relatively simple, unlike their over-extravagant replicas in the recent adaptation by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Also, the costumes are simple and reflect the lifestyles of rural Bengalis in the past, much unlike Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation that features too much jewellery, gold embroidery, rich brocades and fabulous fabrics. In addition to that, this film has great and subliminal histrionic performances by Dilip Kumar, Suchitra Sen and Vyjayanthi Mala. I was captivated by Dilip Kumar's perfect picturisation of a drunk, lovesick Devdas. His dialogues are simple and easier to understand, in comparison with Shahrukh Khan's role, who speaks lots of flowery language. Apart from that, Dilip Kumar's blurred glint in his eyes while playing the drunk Devdas scene with Vyjayanthi Mala is simply natural. Leading Bengali-film tragedy queen Suchitra Sen played Paro in this film, and her performance was the greatest. In my opinion, Paro's (Aishwarya Rai) reaching out to a dying Devdas (Shahrukh Khan) towards the story's end in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation was merely a copy of Suchitra Sen's act in this film: the saris featured in the same scene from both films were exactly the same, too! I strongly feel that Suchitra Sen's performance was at its strongest during this scene, and no other actress can possibly duplicate it. Last but not least, the round of applause should also go to Bollywood's legendary Dancing Queen, Vyjayanthi Mala. She was handpicked by Bimal Roy for her flawless dancing skills. Nevertheless, she not only spiced the film with her fluid Kathak; she also gave the audience a never-seen-before melodramatic side of herself when she played the converted Chandramukhi. Madhuri Dixit's role was simply out of the question whereby she even met up with Paro! Moreover, one ought to note that Chandramukhi is just a courtesan, not a diva, as portrayed by Madhuri Dixit. In short, Vyjayanthi Mala has successfully proved her versatility through Chandramukhi in this film. On top of that, "Devdas" (1955) has a beautiful original musical score. The biggest credit should go to Lataji, who was, at that time, enjoying early success. Her melodious voice made the mujras "Aa Gayi Teri Marzi" and "O Jaane Wale" as well as the touching "Jisse Tu Kabool Kar Le Voh" all-time best-loved nostalgic hits. In a nutshell, Bimal Roy's "Devdas" (1955) will always rank as an evergreen classic in the charts of Bollywood, thanks to the unforgettable acting by Dilip Kumar, Suchitra Sen and Vyjayanthi Mala, Lataji, Talat Mehmood, Mubarak Begum, Asha Bhosle and Usha Mangeshkar's melodious voices as well as the memorable direction of the great film-maker Bimal Roy.</p>
