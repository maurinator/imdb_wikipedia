<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The first puppet kinescope in the world. It is based on the famous poetic comedy by William Shakespeare. Three worlds meet in this story: the noble world of three Athens couples, a common popular world of tradesmen amateur theatre and a fairy-tale happiness of magic creatures as elves and nymphs. The film is considered the most remarkable Jir√≠ Trnka's work and a milestone in the history of the world animation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jiri Trnka - master Czech animator, illustrator, and sculptor. I sing his praises constantly, but this time I wasn't quite as enamored by the animation. While "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is definitely worth seeing, (so colorful) I feel that much less of the camera work and animation was done by Trnka himself.Animating a human puppet convincingly was always something that Trnka managed to do, but the animation within "A Midsummer Night's Dream" feels a little rough around the edges when compared to the previous work within "Old Czech Legends" (which is still my favorite piece, simply due to the quality of the work, and the odd content).So in short, don't pass this one up, but you might be slightly disappointed if you're an uber animation nerd. I have only see this work without English captions/voices.</p>
