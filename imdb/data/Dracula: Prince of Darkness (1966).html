<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two couples traveling in eastern Europe decide to visit Karlsbad despite dire local warnings. Left outside the village by a coachman terrified at the approach of night, they find themselves in the local castle and are surprised at the hospitality extended by the sinister Klove. It turns out the owner, Count Dracula, dead for ten years, has been hoping for such a visit.</p>
<p>The English couples Helen Kent, her husband Alan Kent, his brother Charles Kent and his wife Diana Kent are traveling through the Carpathian Mountain on vacation expecting to climb the mountains. When they are eating in a tavern, they meet Father Sandor that advises them to not go to the castle in Carlsbad. However they ignore the warnings and take a mysterious carriage to the infamous castle. They are welcomed by Dracula's creepy servant Klove that tells that his master died many years ago. Along the night, Helen overhears someone calling her and Alan sees Klove carrying a trunk through the corridor. Alan decides to snoop and follows Klove. However, the servant attacks him in the basement and uses his blood to revive Count Dracula from his ashes. Now the trio of English tourist will experience the presence of the evil creature in their lives.</p>
<p>Ten year after the events in Horror of Dracula (1958), brothers Charles and Alan Kent and their wives Diana and Helen are holidaying in the Carpathians. A traveling monk, Father Sandor, warns them to avoid the nearby castle at all costs which would have been easy since it can't be located on a map and the locals profess no knowledge of a castle nearby. When their coach driver abandons them in a forest due to impending darkness they see the castle in the distance. They enter and find it well maintained and in fact the only person there is Klove, who said his late master left instructions that all travelers seeking refuge were to be given a meal and a place to sleep. Unbeknown to the travelers Klove serves Count Dracula and the blood of one them is used to resurrect him. Charles and Diana escape and seek the assistance of Father Sandor. Before they can send Diana to safety in England, Dracula kidnaps her forcing Charles and Father Sandor to follow Dracula to his own castle and hunt him down.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dracula (Christopher Lee) rides again in yet another Hammer entry in the Dracula franchise. This film is enjoyable horror hokum, but it has an awfully shallow story, fleshed out with a slow opening stretch and some amusing vampire lore in between the sporadic vampire attacks.Four British travellers are journeying through the Carpathian Alps in the 1800s. They are repeatedly cautioned to steer clear of Carlsbad Castle but, being typically stuffy and stubborn, they end up going there anyway. The castle is deserted apart from a rather zombified manservant. During the night, one of the travellers is slain by the manservant, and his blood is used to resurrect the long-dead Count Dracula. Time for another bout of blood-sucking mayhem....Christopher Lee has a small role this time around, but gets across a good performance due to his commanding presence in the title role. Andrew Keir is also good as a priest-cum-vampire-slayer, though he has to overcome some dumb dialogue. The slow build-up is rather damaging, as it generates more tedium than chills. The opportunities for real terror are somewhat fudged too, since most would-be "shock" moments are telegraphed too far in advance. However, Hammer buffs and vampire addicts will doubtless feel more than satisfied.</p>
