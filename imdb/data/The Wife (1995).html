<h1>The Wife (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Noonan's dark comedy features a husband-and-wife team of psychotherapists who run a New-Age therapy group out in the wilderness. Late one night, Jack and Rita are visited by one of their patients, Cosmo, and his wife, Arlie. Cosmo's wife has felt "left out," since her husband spends so much time with the therapists and confides all of their secrets to them. Arlie has insisted on meeting them--the evening begins awkwardly, then painfully grinds on, as various tensions and power struggles emerge between and among the two couples.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A rare play that deserves to be a movie, Tom Noonan plays a New Age healer with marital troubles when one of he and his wife's (Julie Hagerty) patients, played by Wallace Shawn, decides to stop by their house in the woods with his wife, played by Karen Young. The cast is brilliantly effective, and we're never sure exactly who is controlling the evening. Noonan is creepily menacing, and the way he uses the camera for close-ups on actors' faces -- sometimes shown by reflections on winne bottles -- is excellent. There are some cliched parts in the movie -- reflections and mirrors, cheating spouses, drug use, and a night of drinking at a "dinner party" -- but nothing in the film is conventional. This is one of the best movies of 1995. 9/10</p>
