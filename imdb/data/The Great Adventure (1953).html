<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Great Adventure" is a very fine film achievement, in which Director Arne Susksdorff beautifully realizes animal life and nature.  Taking two years to edit the footage, Susksdorff has created a rare glimpse of wild animal life and its special relationship with humans, as depicted through the eyes of a small boy. The black and white photography is superb, and the film's total impact is emotionally moving and unforgettable. This one definitely needs to be available on video!</p>
