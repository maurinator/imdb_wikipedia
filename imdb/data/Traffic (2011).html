<h1>Traffic (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An emotional thriller based on a road trip from Kochi to Palakkad. Inspired from the real events that happened in Chennai.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'Traffic' is undoubtedly, a carefully crafted work, flowing through deep emotional,tensed and dramatic moments. The thrilling plot similar to some of Hollywood's, the movie thrills with parallels weaved from four different angles of a police constable, a movie superstar, a divorced lady, a dying news reporter and his parents. Well worked screenplay,excellent direction, good apt background music and outstanding performance from some good actors all make this movie a heartwarming ride. Kudos!!Still, it's a shock that veterans like Saikumar who delivered a class,subtle and marvelous performance in this movie are still underrated or partially utilized. 'Traffic' - 'never miss'.</p>
