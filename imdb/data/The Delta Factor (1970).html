<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first 70 minutes of "The Delta Factor" are essentially all setup: Christopher George (a convict asked to help the government in exchange for 20 years of imprisonment written off) and Yvette Mimieux (an agent) meet, travel to a Caribbean island, check their hotel room for bugs, organize their mission, get in touch with their local contacts, give and take messages in coded form, etc. This is all fine for a spy flick, but when it takes up more than 3/4 of the total running time, there is a problem. The budgetary constraints are pretty obvious, especially when we keep hearing all the time about this terrible storm that has cancelled all transportations, but we never see any of it! The movie finally picks up in the last 20 minutes, with a prison riot / escape, followed by a pretty cool car chase, followed by George shooting and throwing grenades at the remaining bad guys. All this climactic action does not include Yvette, by the way, but when she is on-screen she is irresistibly gorgeous, with a variety of hairstyles, a knockout face and a fit body. Though she was never really classified as a "sex symbol" in her career, "The Delta Factor" makes it easy to argue otherwise! (**)</p>
