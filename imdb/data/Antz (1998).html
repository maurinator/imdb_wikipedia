<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In an anthill with millions of inhabitants, Z 4195 is a worker ant. Feeling insignificant in a conformity system, he accidentally meets beautiful Princess Bala, who has a similar problem on the other end of the social scale. In order to meet her again, Z switches sides with his soldier friend Weaver - only to become a hero in the course of events. By this he unwillingly crosses the sinister plans of ambitious General Mandible (Bala's fianc√©, by the way), who wants to divide the ant society into a superior, strong race (soldiers) and an inferior, to-be-eliminated race (the workers). But Z and Bala, both unaware of the dangerous situation, try to leave the oppressive system by heading for Insectopia, a place where food paves the streets.</p>
<p>Z the worker-ant strives to reconcile his own individuality with the communal work-ethic of the ant colony. Falling in love with the ant-Princess Bala, Z strives to make social inroads, and then ultimately must save the ant colony from the treacherous schemings of the evil General Mandible that threaten to wipe out the entire worker population. Themes of individuality run rampant.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Antz is a charming romantic comedy that is better appreciated by adults than children. In fact, there are some scenes that may be a bit too violent or gruesome for small children.All of the actors perform brilliantly with an excellent script even though the plot is a bit trite. All the actors excel in their roles even the usually bland Stallone and Lopez who are more animated in this film than in most of their other roles.I found the move to be appealing visually. Apart from some of the backgrounds that seem to be hand painted, the animation is superb.</p>
