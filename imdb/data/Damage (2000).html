<h1>Damage (2000)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The phrase BBC2 drama sums up this well-written, though preachy, slab of realism. Effectively up-to-date language sets off reasonable performances to a considerable, if missable, level. Young talent abounds along with a healthy amount of London cliche - lookout for the housing estate that is constantly playing jungle. Not all bad.</p>
