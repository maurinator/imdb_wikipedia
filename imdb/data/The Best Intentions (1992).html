<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a big fan and admirer of Ingmar Bergman, I was not disappointed at all in The Best Intentions. Of Bergman's resume actually, there were only two movies I didn't care for and they were All These Women and The Serpent's Egg. The Best Intentions may start off a little too slow, but once it gets going there is so much that makes for truly riveting drama. Billie August directs superbly, and the film is beautifully photographed with striking scenery. The script by Bergman himself(he's only writer here) evokes so much thought, giving the film such a powerful and poignant tone, while the story while deliberately paced constantly had me compelled. I know of people who are indifferent to the characters of many films directed by Bergman or with his involvement, but the lack of likability of some of his characters is more than made up by the realism of how they are written. That is precisely the case with The Best Intentions. The acting is superb, especially from Max Von Sydow, with him even the simplest of gestures or expressions are telling of so much. Pernilla August is equally telling for exactly the same reasons. All in all, an intensely beautiful film, though, while one of the best of his later movies, not quite up there among Bergman's finest. 9/10 Bethany Cox</p>
