<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Melissa Leo truly is understated and under-appreciated in the Hollywood industry. She was the best female cop since Cagney and Lacey in Homicide. She truly is very attractive in Time of Destiny. I don't understand how Hollywood can forget such a beautiful presence of hers on screen. With such lovely hair and Irish features, she should easily be one of the hardest working women in show business. I'm shocked she hasn't received a nomination from Homicide. She is truly a scenestealer. I was so upset from Homicide's inconsideration and under appreciation of her talent so I gave up watching the show. What a dumb mistake to give her up! In this film, she chews the scenery away from William Hurt and Timothy Hutton. I believe this is her film and her turn. I just wish Hollywood would use this lady more. I wish Kay Howard would turn up on Law and Order since they always need a new cop.</p>
