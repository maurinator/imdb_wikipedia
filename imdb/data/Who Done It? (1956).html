<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie debut for saucy British TV comic Benny Hill has Benny leaving his job as a sweeper after winning some money. He becomes a private detective and investigates a plot to assassinate British scientists.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>when this film was made Benny Hill was a rising TV star and Ealing Stucios was about to close down to turn over to BBC TV.It is difficult to believe that T.E.B.Clarke could turn out such an inane unfunny script as this.Maybe they were looking to Hill as a sort of lowbrow Alce Guiness to try and replicate his success in "Kind Hearts And Coronets".There is a very distinguished cast of supporting actors.however even such an expert comedy actor as Garry Marsh is reduced to hamming it up to try and extract laughs from the feeble script.It is interesting to note that this was Hills one and only starring effort in film.In his other films he was part of a supporting cast.Maybe if he had been allowed to write this film it would have been a lot funnier.It couldn't have been worse.</p>
