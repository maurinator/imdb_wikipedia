<h1>Renaldo and Clara (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This epic is a mass amalgamation of three separate film-types that is, contrary to popular opinion, coherent and a unified whole. Bob Dylan is shown in concert, often masked, during the Rolling Thunder Revue. The film also features documentary footage, including Ruben "Hurricane" Carter's struggle against the forces that have imprisoned him. The third element is fictional "role-playing" footage with Bob Dylan in the guise of guitar-strumming Renaldo and his wife Sara as his companion Clara. Ronnie Hawkins takes on the role of Bob Dylan in these sequences. The film includes footage of a visit to the grave of Jack Kerouac, an Allen Ginsberg poetry reading and various friends and acquaintances, namely David Blue (playing pinball by a swimming pool), discussing experiences on the road.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The impression I had after seeing this film, was that Bob Dylan made a film thinking it would be easier than what it turned out to be. As Dylan is my favorite musician, poet, singer, whatever... I enjoyed every minute of the film. Sometimes you have the feeling that the result is the same as if an amateur would take a digital camera on the road to film the concerts and the musicians, and also try to put in a bit of philosophy. Ronnie Hawkins and Ronee Blackley pretend to be Dylan and wife, and they have a great fight. Sara Dylan is Clara and Bob is Renaldo, and Dylan is divided between Sara and Joan Baez. Allen Ginsberg joins them on the trip and recites some poetry, goes together with Bob to visit Jack Kerouac's grave, and also lets a woman read his hand. "You had two marriages" she says to him. "Yes, kind of.." he replies. There is a musician who keeps saying to his girlfriend "I won't let you come in between me and my music". Dylan is great when he sings "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" changing the melody, and also "Tangled up in Blue". Joan Baez is charming, looks beautiful and has quite a voice. She sings "Blowin in the Wind" with Bob. They all go to visit Rubin Carter in jail and many people are interviewed on the street about their opinion of what happened to Carter. There is no doubt that somebody like Martin Scorcese could have done better, but still, just to be able to be together with this fantastic group for a couple of hours is worth seeing this film.</p>
