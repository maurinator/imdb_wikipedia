<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Years before we see the first shopping malls, Woody Allen has a film in such mall. The mall was turned by him in embodiment of people's lives and in particular, their married life. With its multiple floors, escalators, shops, restaurants, parks, entertainment halls, organized events for promotions and holidays, the mall has become a world of the modern humans. But that is not the focus here, it is only the background of the most important.This movie is funny and crazy just as love is. Watching it, the viewer is flicking left and right, up and down, should laugh, gladden, be sad, excited and put in position to be doubted in his own situation and maybe to remember and compare it with what is already there. The metaphors of floors and stores with different emotions that they bring, the spiral parking, escalators which symbolize the development of a love affair with all the positive and negative feelings that brings.What I am saying is messy too, as is the movie - it has everything. If you're a fan of what is written here, watch this movie and you will feel truly alive, at least for a while.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</p>
