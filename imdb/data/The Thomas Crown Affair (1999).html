After the theft of a famous painting from Claude Monet, the only person suspecting Thomas Crown is Catherine Banning. Her job is to get the picture back, no matter how she accomplishes her mission.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I caught it on HBO and realized what an entertaining movie this is and regretted not watching it on the big screen.Pierce and Rene owned the movie and their superb acting holds the story together. It is not about the heist nor the painting, though the soundtrack was excellent. It's about love between 2 person who refused to believe that they are capable of being loved.Never a fan of Pierce but this movie certainly cemented his status as an actor. None of his James Bond movie came close to delivering such a superb performance. You can always count on Rene to deliver her best in any movie.You can say I am inlove with this movie and yes you are right indeed. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching movie for what it is and not trying to show off your intelligence by disecting the movie.Simply, one of the best!</p>
