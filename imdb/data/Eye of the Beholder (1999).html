<h1>Eye of the Beholder (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>British Consulate investigator Det. Stephen Wilson, a.k.a. the Eye, comes across a disturbed lady serial-killer while on an otherwise mundane assignment. Already a bit psychologically fragile from his wife's abrupt removal of herself and their daughter from his life (with the lingering memory of his daughter haunting him like a manifest ghost), his psychosis as a displaced dad dovetails with the femme fatale's psychosis as an abandoned daughter (crying "Merry Christmas, Daddy" over her expired victims). A bond forms, or, rather, an obsession, as the Eye abandons his job to secretively stalk this mysterious woman full-time as she visits many major U.S. cities under various names, leaving numerous victims.</p>
<p>An internal investigations detective for the British Consulate in Washington D.C. becomes obsessed with a figure coming within his observations - a beautiful but dangerously troubled woman. When he witnesses her compulsively kill a male sexual partner, he becomes her guardian angel, protecting her from capture. As the web grows deeper, his mental anguishes from past experiences haunt him. Is he in too deep or can he stop himself subsequently stopping her?</p>
<p>A private eye shadows a female serial killer of men all over the U.S. without her knowing as he, strangely enough, occasionally acts as her guardian angel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Movies like this should come with a warning label: "Caution! Do not operate heavy machinery after watching"Unfortunately, I violated one of my own rules of movie-going: never---I repeat, NEVER---go to a movie that the "critics are raving about." The only reason ANYBODY would "rave" about this movie is they couldn't figure it out, so they figure it MUST have some deeper meaning. Anybody that doesn't like it must be one of the shallow, non-creative types that only likes predictable movies. There's ALWAYS a deeper meaning.Trust me. There's no deeper meaning. There's only two hours of non-stop rambling trash that you'll no-doubt find in the cut-out bin of your nearest video store in the next three months. No plot. No character development. Nada. Nil. Fin.Anything the so-called "critics" love is bound to be a worthless piece of #@!$.</p>
