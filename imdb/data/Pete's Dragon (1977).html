<h1>Pete's Dragon (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In New England in the early 20th century, Pete is a nine-year-old orphan escaping from his brutal adoptive parents, the Gogans, with his only friend, a cartoon dragon named Elliott. They successfully escape to Passamaquoddy, Maine, and live with Nora, a lighthouse keeper, and her father, Lampie. Elliott is sought for medicinal purposes by the corrupt Dr. Terminus.</p>
<p>A young troubled boy named Pete and his guardian dragon Elliott elude the abusive Gogan family, who uses him as a slave instead of a loved child. When he can successfully run away from them with Elliott, he stumbles into the town of Passamaquaddy - an ocean front harbor town filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans, and wary townsfolk. His arrival does not mix well with the citizens, as Elliott accidentally causes town rioting and gossip among the town drunks about him. Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is taken in by the kind Nora who lives in a lighthouse with her father Lampie. While Pete bonds with them, the townsfolk have not lowered their guards and suspicions about Elliott. And when Dr. Terminus arrives, a phony con artist posing as a doctor, he sees Elliott as the ultimate profit to his fame. With Passamaquaddy filled with superstition, greed, and lack of imagination, life will not be easy before the town can ever believe Elliott.</p>
<p>An orphan boy and his magical dragon come to town with his abusive adoptive parents in pursuit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations.The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs.It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome.I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.</p>
