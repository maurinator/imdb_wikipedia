<h1>The Ref (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Denis Leary plays an unfortunate cat burglar, who is abandonded by his partner in the middle of a heist, and is forced to take an irritating Connecticut couple (Kevin Spacey, Judy Davis) hostage. He soon finds that he took more than he bargained for when the couple's blackmailing son and despicable in-laws step into the picture. Before long they're driving him nuts with their petty bickering and family problems. The only way for him to survive is to be their referee and resolve their differences, before he can be nabbed by the police.</p>
<p>A cat burglar is forced to take a bickering, dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas Eve.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For years now, I have been able to rely on a twisted programmer at local station CFTO for the perfect antidote to a Christmas overdose to show up, right on schedule, Christmas night, or, at worst, Boxing Day Night.This movie probably isn't as funny if you aren't already full up to your eyeballs with stockings and chestnuts and carols, but on Christmas night, this movie will have you in stitches.The lengthy set-piece when the family finally sits down to Judy Davis' traditional Scandinavian Christmas feast has me laughing out loud every time I see it. Think: Long Day's Journey Into Night on coke. Seriously. (But in a funny way.)Plus: Any movie that contains the line "I just punched out Santa Claus. Don't f**k with me," or words to that effect is a movie with it's heart in such a very wrong place that you just have to love it.</p>
