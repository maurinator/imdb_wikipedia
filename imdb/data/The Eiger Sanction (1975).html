Knowing his employer sent her, he confronts the man and tells what he can do with himself. That's when he is told that the agent who was killed is an old friend of his, and the reason why they need him is because he's a mountain climber and the second man though unknown, is part of group who will be climbing the Eiger, which is a mountain that he tried to climb twice and failed.

<p>A classical art professor and collector, who doubles as a professional assassin, is coerced out of retirement to avenge the murder of an old friend.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie, Like Play Misty For Me this is a different kind of Clint Eastwood movie which is not a western or a cop movie. This is an espionage thriller with a surprise ending. He plays an assassin who comes out of retirement to avenge the death of his friend. In order to catch the unidentified killer he must participate in a mountain climbing expedition which the killer is also participating. Clint really took a big chance while making this movie. He did all the dangerous mountain climbing stunts. If I was directing and starring in a movie I wouldn't do a stunt that is dangerous. I urge Clint Eastwood fans to watch this movie, they won't be disappointed.</p>
