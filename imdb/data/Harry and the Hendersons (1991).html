<h1>Harry and the Hendersons (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Hendersons were a typical sitcom family living in the Pacific Northwest who owned an unusual pet: a real live Sasquatch. While on a camping trip, the Hendersons found Bigfoot, and brought him back to their house to live with them. Problems ensue while trying to repair the damage caused by Harry's curious nature, and while trying to keep his existence a secret.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The TV series basically fell into an Alf clone. In Alf, the family tried to hide Alf from the neighbors and anyone that might be stopping by, on Harry and the Hendersons, they tried to hide Harry (although it's much more difficult to hide a 7 foot tall big foot over a 3 foot tall alien). The series proved that the premise was only good for a one shot deal, not a series with the same jokes each show.I agree that Bruce Davison was no match for John Lithgow. Later in the season, the show was more focused on the family and less on Harry. Also, in a desperate attempt to inject new life into the show, a character was added that did impressions. Unfortunately, it did nothing to shift the focus to Harry.The theme music was also kind of lame. Leon Redbone isn't exactly a popular music artist, although he also sang the theme for Mr. Belvedere</p>
