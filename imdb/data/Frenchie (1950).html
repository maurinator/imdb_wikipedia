<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite a few gritty story elements, "Frenchie" is clearly a western that never takes itself all too seriously. Because of this, although you may not love the film, it is enjoyable and fun.Frenchie (Shelly Winters) is a professional gambler and has just moved into a sleepy western town. Soon after buying the dying local bar, she is able to make a huge success of it--turning it into a gambling parlor. This irks some of the locals who want to keep the town clean and trouble-free, though they don't realize that she has ulterior motives. It seems her father was murdered many years earlier and the trail has led to this and an adjacent town. In the meantime, inexplicably romance blossoms between her and the Sheriff--a guy who wants to shut down the gambling establishment. There's more to it than this (including a murder) but frankly none of it ever seemed very serious. It was like the actors did it all with a wink in their eyes and by the end the viewer is left somewhat satisfied but not bowled over.Strengths of the film include some nice acting, a crazy girl-fight and an unusual plot. The biggest deficit is the homespun comments that come flying from Joel McCrea. If I never heard another "I knew a man once who...." comment from him, I'd be a happy man!</p>
