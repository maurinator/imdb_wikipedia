<h1>Tongpan (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tongpan is a 1977 Thai 16 mm black-and-white docudrama that re-creates a seminar that took place in Northeast Thailand in 1975 to discuss the proposed Pa-Mong Dam on the Mekong. Interwoven are sequences depicting a poor farmer, Tongpan, who had lost his land to another dam some years before, and his struggles to make ends meet. Because of the film's socialist message and suspected communist sympathies of the filmmakers, it was banned by the Thai government. The 63-minute film was released on VCD in Thailand in 2006.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Living in Thailand a few years I've come to see that most movies are incredibly sallow and lucking of any political interest as discussion is not a cultural value in the country. This movie, was for that, a great surprise for me. As I studied the political movement of the three freedom years, from 1973 to 1976, I realised that this movie is one of the best representations of the student movement and it's feelings. Educated middle class people trying to get the farmers involved in their rights life. The story itself is a very common story between farmers, and its well told. But is probably the chance to see the way of living of the farmers what makes the movie so nice, as a documentary of the people in the northeast region, Isaan.I recommend this movie for the ones interested in knowing how farmers live in Isaan, and the way some people tried to help them in that moment in the history of Thailand, that sadly ended with a famous massacre in the 6th of October of 1976.</p>
