<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Delta Burke plays a compulsive gambler, and Gerald McRaney her husband, as in real life, in "Going for Broke." The film shows the step by step deterioration of a woman's life when she starts betting at the local casino. She borrows from the foundation for which she works, borrows from family, and eventually gambles the grocery money. Even when she wins, she loses, because she can't stop.The story holds one's interest and one can't help but feel sorry and frustrated for the character as she digs herself in deeper and deeper, neglecting her children, husband, and job. The story is extra sad because, of course, this happens to people every day due to one addiction or another.Burke, McRaney, and the rest of the cast do an impressive job.</p>
