<h1>A Thin Line Between Love and Hate (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An observable, fast-talking party man Darnell Wright, gets his punishment when one of his conquests takes it personally and comes back for revenge in this 'Fatal Attraction'-esque comic thriller.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you looking for a black-plotation version of Fatal Attraction then this is the one for you. I thought Lynn Whitfield was great as Brandi and played all her emotions really well, and the filming was nice and glossy like a pop video...and that's it for the good things.Lawrence was poor - he really needs a comedy like Bad Boys which won't stretch his acting muscles.  His narration is also simplistic and insulting not letting the audience draw it's own conclusion and treating us likeidiots. His acting is only on one level - the playa, and it doesn't seem to change at any point. Even when he hurts all his women we only really see it in terms of how it affects him and not them..The story is straight-forward and offers nothing new...even the soundtrack is rubbish (full of B-side RnB).We don't need a black Fatal Attraction - especially one that's boring and predictable from start to finish.</p>
