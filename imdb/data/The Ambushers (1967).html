<h1>The Ambushers (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A government space saucer is hijacked mid-flight by a powerful laser beam under the control of Jose Ortega, who then proceeds to rape the female pilot, Sheila Sommars. ICE sends agent Matt Helm to Acapulco with Sheila to recover the saucer, under the guise of Matt taking fashion photographs of beautiful models. Matt is temporarily side-tracked, falling prey to the seductive charms of enemy agent Franceca Madeiros.</p>
<p>A flying saucer built by the U.S. government is launched into space on a top secret test flight. Due to some unknown reason, the saucer can only be piloted by a woman (male test pilots died of radiation poisoning). Sheila Sommars is the pilot chosen and all goes well until Jose Ortega, an exiled ruler for an outlaw nation, uses a secret remote control device to cause the ship to land at his secret base in Mexico. Ortega then rapes Sheila and leaves her for dead only to be found a few months later in a state of shock. Agent Matt Helm is then assigned to find the saucer, with Sheila posing as his wife. When he gets to Mexico, he must not only deal with Ortega and his henchman Quintana, but with enemy agent Fracesca Madeiros (an operative for Helm's main nemesis Big O) and an Arab agent/assassin named Nassim.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a funny spoof of the James Bond series. Dean Martin is hilarious as the stereotypical spy with a drink in one hand and a sexy girl in the other. All the people who call this series a rip off of James Bond are missing the point. I especially loved Kurt Kaznar, playing the despicable character he would play so well in his most famous role on Land of the Giants as Alexander Fitzhugh. Also, Janice Rule is more than just window dressing. She plays the femme fetale role to the hilt and she shows a great flair for comedy in this film. The Matt Helm series was intended to be a parody of that series and did a great job of it.</p>
