<p>In the aftermath of his celebrated match with World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa enjoys his success, and the money he earned from the match (Which Apollo won by split decision and therefore retained the heavyweight championship.). He marries his fianc√©e Adrian, buys her an expensive fox fur, a sports car for himself, and a large new home.

When Rocky later gets laid off from the meat packing company, Adrian, who is now pregnant, tries to support them by continuing to work in the pet shop. Rocky believes he has no future as a boxer and accepts a menial job at the gym run by his former trainer Mickey. Apollo, angered by repeated taunts that his fight with Rocky was fixed, is eager for a high-profile rematch with Rocky to prove that the match was a fluke.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sure, Apollo was pointlessly painted  as the bad guy early in the film, but this  a sequel. While it is not as good as the  first film, it still embodies many of the  themes and hopes which made the first  film so powerful. This time, the audience  got what it wanted, a win for a guy who  had been kicked down for so long. With  more money, the film felt more lucid and  better put together, which made it a whole  new experience in itself. I especially enjoyed  the scene where the kids are chasing Rocky,  certainly one of the most complicated and  time consuming shots of all time, considering  all of the extras the various sequences  needed. Better than an average sequel, it  still pales a shade below the original film.</p>
