<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked this movie very much, even if its nothing new.  I think every generation should have a movie in this genre - there have been so many, going back to "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", that they must mean something to each new viewer.  This is pretty realistic, too, although some of it is a little sugarcoated, it helps to remember that it is a movie.  Pfeiffer is very good as the teacher struggling with several different things all at once.  I must also mention that I appreciate the fact that there was no obligatory love interest for Michelle's character.  I read somewhere that Andy Garcia was edited out of this movie, and as much as I like him, I was glad she didn't have a Supportive Boyfriend Who Understands.</p>
