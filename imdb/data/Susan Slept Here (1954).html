<h1>Susan Slept Here (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mark Christopher is a 35-year old, award-winning comedy scriptwriter who is struggling to be taken seriously as a drama writer. On Christmas Eve, two police officers bring 17-year old Susan (picked up for vagrancy and brawling) to Mark's apartment. If she spends a few days with him, Mark could use Susan as inspiration to write a script about juvenile-delinquents and Susan could avoid spending Christmas behind bars.</p>
<p>Comedy about a struggling Hollywood scriptwriter who, one Christmas Eve, receives a very unexpected present - juvenile delinquent Debbie Reynolds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the missed opportunities of the era was to have Debbie Reynolds and Dick Powell paired in this very funny and perceptive romantic comedy, but not to make it a musical.  That would have given it just that bit of an edge to make it different to hundreds of other movies being churned out with similar plotlines.However, what we have is Reynolds as a teenage delinquent foisted on the well-meaning Powell, a writer, at Christmas.  He wants inspiration for his writing, she wants a sugar daddy.  Guess how this one ends up?One thing I did especially like were the dream sequences, involving cages and spiders and all kinds of things, in lurid pinks.  Where was Tashlin's mind going here?  Fun stuff throughout, however, with a sparkling performance from Reynolds.</p>
