<h1>My Girl (2009)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The new chairman of Holby Trust, Terence Cunningham, arrived for an impromptu visit of Holby where an excited Oliver managed to do some minor damage to his hand. Connie was told by Jayne to put Joseph on her operating schedule instead of Jac as Terence was a friend of the Byrne family, much to Jac's displeasure. But Jac got one up on Connie when she managed to get back an important piece of equipment needed for the operation which Joseph failed to do. Donna's dad Derek disappeared on the day of his operation and Donna eventually found him under the stairs, drunk with a bottle of whiskey. Taking matters into her own hands Donna attempted to flush out his system but Ric found out. Derek's operation and Donna's job were now both at risk. Then Derek's condition deteriorated badly and had to be rushed to theatre. Michael and Ric operated and he survived but his life was hanging in the balance. Oliver became interested in Daisha and less interested in Chrissie.</p>
