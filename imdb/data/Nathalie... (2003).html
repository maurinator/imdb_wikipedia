<h1>Nathalie... (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nathalie is the name a Parisian prostitute assumes for a special mission or "private investigation." She is engaged in this unusual and secretive task by a professional, upper-middle-class wife who fears that her husband is unfaithful to her. Nathalie has to seduce the clueless husband and regularly report all details of her relationship with him, including his most intimate sexual preferences in bed. Nathalie is stunning, charming, and cunning. Can Nathalie and her reports to the mistrustful wife be trusted? Is the middle aged husband indeed unfaithful?</p>
<p>In Paris, the executive Bernard and his wife, the gynecologist Catherine, form a bored upper-middle-class, middle-aged bourgeois couple. They have been married for many years and their life no longer has any sexual. One day, Catherine listens to the message on his cell phone, and she believes that Bernard is unfaithful to her. Catherine hires the beautiful prostitute Marl√®ne to pretend to be a young woman named Nathalie, and seduce and investigate the sex life of Bernard and report his secrets and performance between walls to her. Catherine discloses a surprising revelation in the end.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nathalie is most marked by silence and waiting. The husband does not talk about his extra marital dealings with his wife, and she does not ask about his. Neither of them speak to Nathalie about the truth of the relationship. I find this contrast to the 'let it all hang out' philosophy of marriage to be refreshing. There are many moral questions raised in this film; is 'talking it out' a good idea when the partners have been married this long, and will it change anything? Who is Nathalie's real customer? What would have happened if the husband and wife had had a row; would the husband have stayed until the end, when everything was revealed? These are good questions, not often dealt with; but the French seem to love having a go at them. Emmanuelle is well chosen as she does a lot of looking pensive, and her face is good for that: Fanny also stares a lot into the middle distance, and her bone structure is good for the late-forties woman she portrays; Depardieu is just such a nice guy underneath his philandery that you can almost believe he loves his wife and will wait to have her back. I liked the film. I like films that make one think.</p>
