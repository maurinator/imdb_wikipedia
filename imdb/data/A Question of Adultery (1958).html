<h1>A Question of Adultery (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mark Loring is madly jealous of his wife, Mary, former American cabaret singer. Due to an automobile accident, she loses her unborn child, and Mark becomes sterile. His father, Brit-stuffy Sir John Loring, has never approved of the marriage and, again, tries to break it up. Believing that a child will hold the marriage together, Mary suggests artificial insemination to Mark, who finally agrees to accompany her to a clinic in Switzerland. However, when she is again pregnant, Mark finds it impossible to reconcile himself to the situation and leaves her. Prompted by his father, Mark sues for divorce, accusing her of adultery. She contests the divorce and a trial concerns itself with whether or not artificial insemination is a question of adultery. The Catholic Church's National League of Decency placed this film on its Condemned" list.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Producer Raymond Stross and director Don Chaffey are clearly out to capture the exploitation market here. They create a big fuss by asking if artificial insemination is a basis for divorce on the grounds of adultery, and then blithely sidestep an answer! As for the acting, good old Anthony Steel is as wooden as usual, while Julie London and Anton Diffring are wasted in indifferent roles. Fortunately, always reliable Donald Houston, Frank Thring and Anton Diffring show us a good time with their legal arguments. But who got the mad idea of casting Conrad Phillips as a Spaniard? A crummy actor at best, Phillips makes a laughable fist of this inept role.</p>
