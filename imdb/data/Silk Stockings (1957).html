<h1>Silk Stockings (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A musical remake of Ninotchka: After three bumbling Soviet agents fail in their mission to retrieve a straying Soviet composer from Paris, the beautiful, ultra-serious Ninotchka is sent to complete their mission and to retrieve them. She starts out condemning the decadent West, but gradually falls under its spell, with the help of Steve Canfield, an American movie producer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a senior I'll make a couple of stock comments; "They don't make em like this anymore and " Pop culture of the 50's in the USA was artful and demanded talent. Beautiful and sensuous Cyd Charisse and "All Pro" musical dancer Fred Astaire team up wonderfully to update and old story  put to music. The settings are lush and the dancing is suberp. Peter Lorre and Janis Paige add the right touch of humor and talent. Although much of the "Cold War" lingo seemed corny, if you were an adult at the time this movie was made, you'll find it hillarious but so true. All said and done, it is a pleasureable treat!</p>
