<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Neil Jordan's depiction of the controversial life and death of Michael Collins, the "Lion of Ireland", who led the IRA against the UK and helped found the Irish Free State in 1922.</p>
<p>After the disastrous defeat of Irish rebels by superior UK forces during the Easter Rising, Michael Collins develops new strategies for the independence of Ireland. His tactics include what is now recognized as urban guerrilla tactics and organized assassinations of those Irish who work as informers for the UK government, and later members of British intelligence. Although Collins is conflicted about the necessity of this violent course, by 1921 the British are willing to negotiate. Sinn Fein President Eamon de Valera sends a reluctant Collins to London to negotiate a settlement. When Collins returns with a compromise of a partitioned Ireland and an Irish Free State, not a Republic, within the British Empire he is vilified by de Valera and repudiated by lifelong friend Harry Boland after Boland learns that his girlfriend Kitty Kiernan is in love with Collins. Collins is now faced with civil war as he struggles against those who insist on complete and unconditional independence for all of Ireland.</p>
<p>Neil Jordan's historical biopic of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins, the man who led a guerrilla war against the UK, helped negotiate the creation of the Irish Free State, and led the National Army during the Irish Civil War.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Neil Jordan's historical biopic about Michael Collins, the man who fought for a free Ireland in the early 20th Century, has its heart in the right place, but it just doesn't work. I'm not sure why it doesn't work exactly, because it's got a good central performance from Liam Neeson, an intelligent screenplay and handsome production design. Despite all of those qualities, however, it just sits on the screen like a lead paperweight.One thing that definitely IS wrong with the film is Julia Roberts, horribly miscast and giving a lame performance. Roberts is far too contemporary an actress ever to be convincing in a period piece, and she's not a good enough actress to fake it.Grade: C</p>
