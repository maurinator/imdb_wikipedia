<h1>Dracula 2000 (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the millenium version of this classic Gothic horror we find Abraham Van Helsing (Plummer), who has tangled with Count Dracula (Butler) in the past, working as an English antiques dealer. Simon (Miller) is a vampire hunter in training under his apprenticeship. Van Helsing and Simon travel from London to New Orleans to rescue Van Helsing's daughter Mary (Waddell) from the family's life long nemesis - Dracula.</p>
<p>A group of thieves break into a chamber expecting to find paintings, but instead they release the count himself, who travels to New Orleans to find his nemesis' daughter, Mary Van Helsing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Please don't waste your time.  This movie rehashes the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and Blade (high-tech toys).  I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good . But not this stinker.  Not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the "kick-ass metal" some reported.  Only a few times did I hear any metal; mostly it was tortured violins.  Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.</p>
