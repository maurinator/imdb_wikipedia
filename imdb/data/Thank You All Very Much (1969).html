<h1>Thank You All Very Much (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young London girl studying a doctorate in the British museum spends her nights trying to avoid the sexual admiration of men in her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After seeing Sandy Dennis in all her somewhat-quirky roles ( I even saw her hit '60,s play "Any Wednesday", before she got into films), it was almost a revelation: how beautiful and fine her performance. Also, interesting as time warp: 60's situation and attitude, also all the other fine performers when they were young( Bron, Standing, McKellen )</p>
