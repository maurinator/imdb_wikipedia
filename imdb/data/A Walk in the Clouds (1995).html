<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an enjoyable film without a lot of surprises. It is pleasant without being really suspenseful, and its sweetness may be a little too much for the small screen where on the big screen, you just go with it. Aitana S치nchez-Gij칩n is flawless as the female lead, which is a good thing considering her leading man is the almost always flaw-FUL Keanu Reeves, who has amazingly held onto his leading man status despite having only his great looks and minimal talent (the modern-day Rock Hudson). With a great supporting cast (including a pre-Six Feet Under Freddy Rodriguez and a post-original "Swept Away" Giancarlo Giannini), Reeves' shortcomings as an actor can't help but stand out. Amid all the good players and romantic tone, there's also some lovely scenery and good costuming.But seeing this film on HBO nearly ten years after viewing it on the big screen begs the following questions: Why has Penelope Cruz been foisted on the American moviegoer when we could have had Aitana S치nchez-Gij칩n all along?! Why did it take Hollowood so long to rediscover Debra Messing after her bit part in this film? Why is Keanu Reeves a big star while the extremely sexy Gregory Martin (whom I still remember steaming up the small screen in the miniseries "Ellis Island") never appeared in a movie again? Man, he was hot! And although you wouldn't know it from his small role here, I'm sure he could act circles around you-know-who.I may never get answers to these questions, but if your video store doesn't carry "Il Postino" and "Cinema Paradiso," you might want to check out this slightly inferior but nevertheless enjoyable film. The reason the story is timeless is because it is an English language remake of the 1942 film, "Quattro passi fra le nuvole," and it was a good idea on the part of the producers to resurrect it.</p>
