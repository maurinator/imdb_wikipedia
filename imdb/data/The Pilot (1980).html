<h1>The Pilot (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Our Pilot, Mike Hagan is a great pilot, careful, thoughtful and uses his knowledge of flying to see trouble and avoid it. But his biggest trouble is he is an alcoholic. Unlike the movie "Flight", Mike realizes his problem and is determined to "save himself". But you can't hide for ever and he seeks help from a fellow pilot. The other pilot's program works, but once an alcoholic, always one except he doesn't drink. Everything comes to a head, (no pun intended) for Mike as he now must face the reality of his job, The Pilot!</p>
<p>Mike Hagan is a pilot in passenger service and candidate for the honor "Best Pilot of the Year". Nobody knows that he's got private sorrows - he's an alcoholic. A stewardess notices his regular visits of the toilet and reports it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The story line is good. What makes this a must see is the true to life cockpit footage. This is the most real to life cockpit filming including ATC, checklist usage and procedures that I have ever seen. Thanks to Cliff Robertson, who is a pilot, this movie is awesome if you are a pilot-or a fan of aviation. Finding this movie is a difficult task. I found it once in Blockbuster in the mid 80's but nothing since. The whole movie is a struggle for Mike Hagan with drinking and keeping his edge in the cockpit. Good ending, doing what you love is what he turns to. I think this movie is underrated as the story line is a personal struggle and involves his work.</p>
