<h1>The Fugitive (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Richard Kimble is accused as the murderer of his wife, tried and convicted. On his way to be executed, he escapes. The only chance to prove his innocence is to find the man who killed his wife. Kimble, pursued by Lt. Gerard, risks his life several times when he shows his identity to help other people out of trouble.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Kimble, a pediatrician in Stafford, Indiana, has an argument with his wife Helen and storms off. While returning his car almost hits a one armed man who darts out into the street from the vicinity of his home. Running into his home past the open front door, he sees Helen dead on the floor. Although innocent, he is tried and convicted for murder, and sentenced to death. Police Lieutenant Phillip Gerard is taking Kimble by train to prison to be executed, when the train derails and Kimble escapes. He travels from place to place, frequently changing his name, taking jobs where he can get them, usually menial, and ever on the alert lest he be recognized and captured. Lt. Gerard and other police are hot on his trail, and even well-meaning civilians can cause his ruin. While running, Kimble constantly seeks the one armed man so he can prove his innocence. Viewers can certainly believe in his innocence, since in each episode he displays outstandingly good character, frequently putting himself at risk to help another person in need. The fact he must frequently travel puts Kimble in a variety of interesting situations involving people of all different characters from all stations of life. Although he no longer has a medical license, his skills as a doctor are often needed and play a role in the drama. The main character, Richard Kimble, is intelligent, modest, generous, honest, hard-working, strong and trustworthy. Attractive to the ladies, he has many romances throughout his travels, and is always honest with them about the fact he never sticks around one town too long. Yet, the nature of being a fugitive occasionally requires some dishonest and even violent conduct on his part, though never too violent. His adversary, Lieutenant Phillip Gerard feels responsible for Kimble's escape, and Kimble is never far from his mind. Gerard is intelligent, honest, and completely devoted to duty. He does not bother himself with the question of whether Kimble is innocent, because the courts declared him guilty, and it is Gerard's job to obey their orders. His shrewd detective skills often place Kimble in severe jeopardy. Kimble gets away at the end of every episode, sometime through his own efforts, sometimes through luck, and sometimes with the aid of a citizen, or even a policeman, who believes in Kimble's innocence or otherwise is impressed with his good deeds. The one armed man does not appear in many episodes, but is an evil presence throughout the series. When he does appear, he is ruthless, violent, and simple-minded, with good instincts for self-preservation. Like Kimble, he is a fugitive, having to run from the relentless pursuit of Kimble. Toward the end of the series he appears more often, and Kimble learns his name, Fred Johnson.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Kimble, an Indiana pediatrician, is accused, arrested, tried and convicted of the murder of his wife. Kimble claims he was on his way home from a drive when the murder occurred, and saw a one-armed man running from his house upon his return. Kimble manages to escape from the detective assigned to the case, Lt. Philip Gerard, and spends the next four seasons on the run--helping people with their problems and searching for the one-armed man, while running before the relentless pursuit of the police detective obsessed with his capture--Gerard.</p>
<p>Richard David Kimble is a pediatrician living in Stafford, IN, a suburb some 75 miles from Indianapolis. His wife is Helen Waverly-Kimble, a former nurse whom he met while a hospital intern. In 1961 they are to have a baby, but their baby dies upon being born and Helen can physicially no longer bear children. When Richard Kimble wants to adopt a child, Helen objects, and the disagreement stresses their relationship until, on the fateful night of September 19, 1961, Richard storms out of their house after another bitter quarrel. After a drive, he cools off and returns home, but as he arrives he sees a heavyset man running out of his house and nearly strikes him. The man's image burns into Kimble's pysche; heavyset, with short black hair, saddish eyes, mildy cherubish complexion, and his right arm below the elbow is missing. The man (who will eventually be identified as Fred Johnson) runs off, and Kimble rushes into his house - to find Helen lying on the floor, dead. The Stafford PD's investigation uncovers no one-armed man matching Kimble's description, and he is charged with Helen Kimble's murder, convicted, and sentenced to the electric chair. But in March 1963, while being escorted by the investigating officer of Helen's murder, Lieutenant Philip Gerard, the train on which both men are riding derails, and in the crash Kimble becomes seperated from Gerard. Now free, Kimble flees into the night, and his journey begins, as he traverses the country, searching for Fred Johnson, the one-armed vagrant who killed Helen Kimble, and helping others he meets in his travels. All the while he must stay one step ahead of Philip Gerard, who blames himself for Kimble's escape and who is determined to bring the Fugitive to justice, despite doubts within his own mind as to Kimble's guilt.</p>
<p>A doctor, wrongly convicted for a murder he didn't commit, escapes custody and must stay ahead of the police to find the real killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Fugitive was a top show starring David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble. Kimble had been wrongly accused of the murder of his wife and he went on the run pursued by Lt. Gerard (played by Barry Morse). His only method of proving his innocence was to find the one-armed man who had killed his wife.It was a very realistic drama show and David Janssen drew the audience into his predicament. Whatever pain he was feeling, the audience felt too. He was a man who viewers could empathize with. Each week he travelled from place to place meeting up with people, most of whom sympathized with his predicament. There was tension and drama throughout the entire series run. It was a very believable drama. It's a pity that nobody can produce shows like that any more.One other thing; I believe this show inspired The Incredible Hulk live action series from the late 70's. In both cases, innocent men were on the run for crimes they didn't commit, both men were pursued (David Banner was pursued by a reporter) and both David Janssen as Kimble and the late Bill Bixby as David Banner drew the viewers into their predicament.</p>
