<h1>Too Late (1996)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Romanian director Lucian Pintilie's film "Trop Tard" starts in Germany with three young violin players and ends in Romania.We are shown that these talented musicians cannot bathe themselves due to acute water shortage as taps run dry.This is something which normally happens in third world countries but some communist countries of Europe are no exception to this rule.In some of these early scenes, there is a real sense of constant movement,a desire to escape bitter,harsh realities of Romania.This feeling of evasion is very much evident throughout the entire film.In Prea târziu,(Trop Tard/Too late)Lucian Pintilié exposes miserable plight of hapless miners who are at the mercy of corrupt mining officials.Too late is also a story about guilty conscience.It is more of an exposé about corruption than being a detective story involving a public prosecutor who is determined to solve a difficult case of two dead miners.Pintilié tells us that it is too late for some communist societies as things should have been corrected a long time ago.The film send us a message that there is an imminent need to change the ways a communist society functions.</p>
