<h1>Genesis (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A parable of man's exploitation of his fellow man. A weaver and a farmer live peacefully on the edge of a desert until, one day, a woman wanders into their world, and her presence slowly disrupts their routine existence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mrinal Sen's minimalist masterpiece Genesis is a cinematic oddity - like the principal characters in the story - the weaver and the farmer the film itself seems to exist outside of time and space.Hardly anyone has heard of it, let alone managed to see it. Even Sen-iphiles continue to be blissfully unaware.This is surprising considering the kind of talent of which the film boasts. The minuscule cast consists of the cream of the crop - Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Shabana Azmi - among the finest Indian actors of their generation.The picture can be read as a religious and political allegory, but most of all it symbolizes itself - an obscure gem lost underneath the rubble of "progress".</p>
