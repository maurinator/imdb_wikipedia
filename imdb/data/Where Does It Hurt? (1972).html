<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We have laughed until we cried watching this movie.  We were fortunate to have taped it off the TV for our own personal viewing, however we did this on BETA so.... when we put it on VHS the copy degraded somewhat.Pat Morita was brilliant as the lab tech.  When he sang along with the Spanish radio..... Sellers is a master of facial expression & in this movie, he was at his best.  This is a movie that needs to be released. Is there any way to light a fire under someone so they will know where it hurts (under them) and get this wonderfully funny movie released???  There is money to be made selling Sellers' funniest! Here's hoping!</p>
