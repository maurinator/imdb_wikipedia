<h1>Animal Room (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Exasperated over their lack of viable solutions to problem students and growing school violence, teachers and school administrators institute a trial program whereby they can lock away those kids who "don't fit into the mainstream profile." Brainy malcontent Arnold Mosk - despite strenuous objections from his school counselor - is labeled a trouble student and herded into the program for dropping acid to escape his problems, both those at school and at home. While old friend Gary Trancer tries to reconnect with and support Arnold, sociopath Doug Van Housen takes cruel delight in leading his gang of violent school thugs to torment and bully those around him, especially Arnold, leading to tragedy.</p>
<p>Cynical and intelligent Arnold Mosk, a known drug user, is put into a disciplinary program at his high school meant for the seriously disturbed where he becomes the main target of the psychopathic Doug Van Housen and his gang.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved Animal Room...not everyones cup of tea but I thought it was fantastic. Incredible visuals and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. Performances were compelling and everytime I thought I knew where the story was going...it took a turn I both enjoyed and never expected. The filmmaker has a lot to say and does a beautiful job without seeming "preachy" or heavy handed. Honest and raw...this film touches nerves most films don't dare go near. It's a bit darker than most but I've never been rocked by a film in such a way and it really stayed with me. Totally original....might freak out older or more mainstream folks..I saw this film with a group of friends and they were equally impressed. Matt Lillard was never better. Check this one out!</p>
