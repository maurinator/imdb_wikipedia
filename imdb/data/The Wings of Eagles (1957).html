<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>U.S. Navy pilot Frank 'Spig' Wead is a fun-loving and rowdy adventurer, but also a fierce proponent of Naval aviation. His dedication to the promotion of the Navy's flying program is so intense that his marriage and family life suffer. When an accident paralyzes him, Spig finds a new means of expressing his love of flying: screenwriting. Successful and acclaimed, he finds the U.S. entry into World War II to be an irresistible call. Pleading that he be reinstated in the Navy despite his paralysis, Spig finds he has an enormous contribution yet to make.</p>
<p>A biography of Navy flier-turned-screenwriter Frank W. "Spig" Wead.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Wings of Eagles" starred John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara and was directed by John Ford.  While not a blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination, the film nevertheless has some great touches that would make a viewer wish to see the film again.  Wayne played Lt. Commander Frank "Spig" Wead, the man credited with getting the Navy an air wing to support its military ships, and Maureen O'Hara plays the wife that has to contend with Spig's love of country first and family second.  Dan Dailey has a good role as Wead's best friend in the military, while other members of the John Ford company of players contribute their talents to the film.  Ken Curtis shows up a good bit, and Ward Bond has a role as a film director that smacked of a caricature of John Ford.  Bond plays this to the hilt, and seemed to enjoy the chance to show Ford how he came off, at times.The scenes that were very watchable could include several fight scenes between members of the Army Air Corps and their Naval counterparts, plus a very heart rending view of Wayne's efforts to rehabilitate himself, following a fall down a flight of stairs at his house.  Good, but not great, an 8/10.</p>
