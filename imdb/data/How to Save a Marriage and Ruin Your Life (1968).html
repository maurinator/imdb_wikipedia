<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was written and produced by the same people who worked on the great Hudson/Day films.   Those innocent sex comedies worked well in the early 60s but by the end of the decade they seemed a bit dated and even more contrived.  Maybe that is part of the reason why this movie wasn't as big a hit as the prior teaming of Dean Martin and Stella Stevens for Columbia, The Silencers (1966).Martin plays a confirmed bachelor (the playboy kind, not the gay kind) who suspects his best friend (Wallach) is having an affair with one of his employees (Stevens).  Martin tries to help save his friend's marriage by trying to break up the relationship and starts wooing the wrong woman (Stevens) to prove her unfaithful.  Wallach is actually having the affair with a completely different woman (Anne Jackson).When Martin finds out his mistake he tries to shake Stevens, after already moving her into a posh apartment and getting her to quit her job for him. Stevens finds out about his deception and WAR starts.The stars and supporting cast in this movie do a great job and there are some very funny moments.  I think this is THE movie where Stella Stevens got the big build-up as the "new Marilyn Monroe."  She's definitely beautiful, sexy and funny enough to deserve the title.</p>
