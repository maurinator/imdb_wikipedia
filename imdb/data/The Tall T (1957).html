<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>said, unnecessarily harshly, to the poor leading lady at the very end of the "Tall T" as Randolph Scott,having killed the bad guys, drags her, whimpering, towards the horses Poor girl. Just married, she has been kidnapped, betrayed by her new husband,seen him killed, been almost raped, forced to cook for the kidnap gang, and watch as Scott picked them all off one by one and left them in a heap. Wouldn't you whimper in these circumstances ? But Scott is having none of it.It's a brilliant closing line in another one of the Boetticher-Brown-Scott collaborations that so enlivened the western genre in the late fifties. Beautifully written -- as was my other particular favourite "Ride Lonesome" -- all the actors bounce off Scotts' granite-featured impeturbality beautifully (Richard Boone, as ever, deserves a special mention) and the film encompasses a lot of aspects of western life as well as tells its' story at a good lick.The only minus point was the cowardly husbands' boot-lace moustache. You knew he was going to do the dirty on his wife the moment you saw him, the cad !</p>
