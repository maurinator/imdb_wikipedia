<h1>Eve (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Adventurer and treasure hunter Mike Yates is hoping to find a cache of Incan treasure lost in the Amazon jungle. While looking for his missing partner, he stumbles across a beautiful jungle girl named Eve. Later on, he comes across Eve's grandfather, who is being swindled by a man and a young woman who is pretending to be his granddaughter Eve. Will Yates be able to expose the swindle, beat the swindlers to the lost treasure (with the help of the real Eve), and reunite Eve with her grandfather before the final credits role?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my favorites! Why? It has a gorgeous woman in a leather bikini in the middle of the jungle. Ms. Yarnall is simply stunning. One of my favorite scenes is when the bad natives decide she needs to die. They converge at the bottom of her tree house, throw fiery spears in it and smoke her out. She slides down a long rope in the arms of the leader. Snug against him she has second thoughts. Reaching for her dagger at her hip the native grabs it first. Deciding not to plunge it into her he lifts her above his head and encourages the other thousand native to carry her back to their camp for torture. There's an nice ariel shot of "Eve" as the hoard carry her to their camp. She's swooning, helpless and oh so fetching.Earlier Eve is bathing at a lake. Some natives rush her and try to strangle her. She stabs them and turns her whip on the leader. That set up the above scene.Wild animals jump on her, she stretches provocatively, run around the jungle in next to nothing...does it get any better than that?</p>
