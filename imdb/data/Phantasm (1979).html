<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are two things that stand out in this film. The Tall Man (played  by Angus Scrimm) and the chrome sphere with hook-like blades that stick  out of it. Those are the two main elements when it comes to this horror  series directed by Don Coscarelli.The Tall Man comes from another dimension where he takes some of the  earth's dead back to his home planet, reincarnates them and turns them  into slaves for his world. He even occasionally murders some earth  people in order to speed things up. Why wait for them to get old and  die natural deaths. That would take too much time, right? And what  better earth profession he can hide his identity behind than that of a  funeral parlor director. Everything goes smoothly for the Tall Man until Mike Pearson (Michael  Baldwin) witnesses him carting a body away that's supposed to be buried  in the ground. At first his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) doesn't  believe him, but when Mike shows him a cut-off finger surrounded by  'yellow blood' in a little wooden box he had saved as proof, Jody  starts to believe him. Excellent scene of the chrome sphere zooming down the funeral parlor  hallway and 'accidentally' digging into the skull one of the Tall Man's  henchmen. A little screw appears out of it and starts to bore a hole  through his skull, ejecting the excess blood out a hole in the back of  the sphere. I wish there was more of the sphere although we'll get to  see a lot more of it again in PHANTASM II (1988).I also like the portal gateway scene where if you go through the two  chrome poles, you'll get to see the Tall Man's alternative universe  where the slaves are busy carrying caskets down a stone pathway. We  even get to see Ice Cream Man, Reggie Bannister almost get sucked  through it as well.I won't give away the ending but let's just say the Tall Man is  temporarily disposed of until the next sequel comes out, although the  dream element that's supposed to encompass the whole sequence of events  in the film, is a big negative against it. In fact, it brings it down a  notch, unfortunately.Even so, I consider PHANTASM to be one of the best horror films of the  1970s. It managed to keep Avco/Embassy in business so they could bring  us later horror stuff like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1980); THE FOG (1980)  and DEAD AND BURIED (1981)The MGM DVD also has a lot more extras on it than you would expect from  other DVDs released by the same company, including 8mm  behind-the-scenes footage of the making of PHANTASM; a 1979 interview  down in Miami with director Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm; an appearance  at a 1989 Fangoria convention by Scrimm, and movie & TV trailers for  the film. It's a labor of love by the truest fans of this film. 7 out of 10</p>
