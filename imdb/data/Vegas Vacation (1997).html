<h1>Vegas Vacation (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Clark Griswold puts his mind to something, we soon realize he hasn't got one. Still, nothing stops him when the vacation bug hits. This time, he's chosen Las Vegas, the new family entertainment capital of America! Chevy Chase returns as bubbly, bumbling Clark in Vegas Vacation, a jokers-are-wild laugh fest including two other stars from past Vacations. Beverly D'Angelo is back as wife Ellen, doting on the guy she calls "Sparky," and Randy Quaid again delights as grubby goof ball Cousin Eddie. Ethan Embry (That Thing You Do!) and screen-debuting Marisol Nichols are Griswold teens who love the round-the-clock nightlife - as long as they don't share it with Mom and Dad! From Seigfried and Roy's extravaganza to a Hoover Dam tour, from cruising to losing (Wallace Shawn as a shifty blackjack dealer) to amorous crooning (Wayne Newton falls for Ellen): watch Clark try to keep family and wallet together!</p>
<p>In the fourth outing for the vacation franchise, the Griswolds have to survive Vegas fever when they go to Las Vegas for a fun family vacation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What? There's another Vacation film?! Cool! Let's watch it! Okay, after the first viewing, you probably won't like this film that much. After a week, you'll probably forget you saw it, you watch it again, and then and only then, will you learn to truly appreciate the second best Wallace Shawn film ever. Randy Quaid is hilarious, but not quite as good as he was in Christmas Vacation, but still good. Then, there's this one problem.I DON'T CARE ABOUT CLARK'S DAUGHTER! That's right, there's a subplot about Clark's daughter... becoming a prostitute? Yeah, I'm 80% sure that's what it is! What the heck?! The franchise films were alway raunchy, but nothing like that. Well, unless you count those scenes from the first two but... Chevy Chase got old.</p>
