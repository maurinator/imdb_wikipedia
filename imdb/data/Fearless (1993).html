<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie really spoke to me. I find it hard to say whether or not is good or bad. Peter Weirs films have a way of communicating intense emotion to me, although not all are quite so good- I watched all of the disappointing Dead Poets society, and only felt this emotion in one scene- where the boy commits suicide. A powerful scene. In 'picnic at hanging rock' I felt this intense emotion a few times, especially with that shot of the girls disappearing.I had wanted to see Fearless for a number of years and was not disappointed. I have never seen a film in my life that affected me so much. But hey, you might watch this and feel nothing. It is about human emotion, about the meaning of life and our mortality. If you care about these then I would guess this film would say something to you.If you feel like an outsider, like an alien drifting amongst strangers, this is the film for you. If you dream of enlightenment, take pleasure in the simple intensity of the moment this is the film for you also. IMHO, is not just Peter Weirs greatest film, I feel it is one of the greatest films I have seen.</p>
