<h1>Homicidal (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story centers around a murderous scheme to collect a rich inheritance. The object of murder is Miriam Webster, who is to share in the inheritance with her half brother Warren, who lives with his childhood guardian Helga in the mansion where Warren and Mariam grew up. Confined to a wheelchair after recently suffering a stroke, Helga is cared for by her nurse Emily, a strange young woman who has formed a close bond with Warren.</p>
<p>Miriam Webster is happy when her half brother Warren and their childhood nanny Helga, now partly paralyzed and unable to speak, return to the United States after a lengthy stay in Europe. Warren will soon turn 21 and will inherit their father's $10 million estate and although she will get nothing - their father's will specified that only a male heir could inherit - she's happy in her circumstances. One person she doesn't like however is Emily who came with Warren and Helga from Europe and now lives with them as a housekeeper/companion. Miriam has good reason not to like her as she seems to be a homicidal maniac. What Miriam doesn't realize is that there is method behind Emily's madness and a deep family secret that she is not privy to.</p>
<p>The brutal stabbing murder of a justice-of-the-peace sparks an investigation of dark family secrets in a sleepy small town in Southern California.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Homicidal" is a very strange movie. It's among the best of William Castle's gimmicky horror films, but unlike any of them. Fans of "camp" should have a field day with this one. Jean Arless plays a fascinating part, but her obvious disguises and stilted acting are sorely out of step with everyone else's naturalistic looks and behavior. However, the story is absorbing, clever and ultimately entertaining. Films that take their cue from "Psycho" normally make me bristle, but this time it's actually quite interesting to catch the references as they continue to pile up (There are so many). Would love to know what Hitchcock thought of this movie.</p>
