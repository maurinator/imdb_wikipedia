<h1>Here on Earth (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The lives of three young people - a rich student, a girl from the "wrong side of the tracks" and her boyfriend - unexpectedly intersect during one fateful summer in the romantic drama "Here on Earth." Kelley Morse (Chris Klein), who is cocky and brash, normally would never have crossed paths with the residents of a small town near his posh private school. But when he takes his shiny new Mercedes out for a drive, he locks horns with some of the locals, including Jasper (Josh Hartnett). As Jasper's willful girlfriend Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) looks on, Kelley and Jasper engage in a dangerous car race that turns disastrous, leaving a popular diner owned by Samantha's mother in ruins. Kelley and Jasper are sentenced to a creatively ironic but fitting punishment: They must help rebuild the diner. Not only does this ruin Kelley's summer plans, he also must board at the home of his rival, Jasper. Kelley begins to fulfill his "sentence," but refuses to have anything to do with Jasper and his parents. When Kelley again encounters Samantha, the attraction is immediate and strong. First love blossoms in the Berkshire woods ("a little bit of heaven, here on earth," Samantha calls the pastoral setting), angering Jasper, who has known Samantha practically his entire life. These new feelings and the romantic triangle that develops are only the beginning of a new journey for Kelley, Samantha and Jasper, as they ultimately make life-changing discoveries about themselves and each other.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>HERE ON EARTH (2000) Rating: 3/10At one point in Here on Earth, my sister and me said aloud the reasons why this movie was so bad. At this point, Leelee Sobieski's character was jumping on a bus to go away with Kelley (Chris Klein). Here are some of the things we pointed out: we don't care for Leelee Sobieski's character, whatever happens to her, she is a two-timing bitch. Nor do we care for the fate of the rest of the characters. You can't just jump on a bus without a ticket and no money. You don't just leave your boyfriend there standing on the side of the road. I could go on forever, but I think the word stupid really sums up this movie. While not only being highly unrealistic, this movie is boring and heartless, while what the goal obviously was to make the audience really be enthralled and the film be totally emotional. No, the crew has not reached their goal. This has turned out to be a cheese-ball of a film where you don't like the characters and have no sense of sympathy for what happens to them. There are also a lot of sight flaws in this film, um, hello, the guys beat up each other (yet another flaw, for the first half an hour, the 2 guys are just pounding in one and other's face, as if the script-writer's could think of anything more `entertaining') and within the next day their scars are gone. And did anyone else notice Kelley (Klein's character) wears the same shirts throughout the summer? I'll stop there now, but if I could be bothered, I could list the flaws in this movie and sell it as a novel. Stay away from this film.</p>
