<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now, keep in mind that I'm going to try to make this as least-hostile as possible. But when a movie is this hypocritical, bigoted, and ignorant, there is nothing good that can be said about it. Except for the people who were literally bribed into writing positive reviews.1: This movie was stolen. Everything in this movie was stolen from the first two. All they did was literally take the first movie, and remove the action parts and the horror parts.2: The sexism. This movie is probably the most sexist movie since Doomsday Machine. They replaced the entire main cast with only women to appeal to the radical Feminists. When your ideology discriminates against who you can cast in a role, that is called Fascism, and it's not a good thing.3: The bland lobotomized token male. Pretty much the only main character who was a man was turned into a stereotype. He was useless, annoying, fake, had an IQ below sea-level, and was clearly trying to pretend to be Brad Pitt, but with none of the acting talent. He also only got hired because of his looks.4: The racism. The only black character was turned into a loud, annoying, street-smart stereotype.5: The CGI. It was terrible, and very cartoon-like. "Daffy Duck: The Early Years"6: The acting. Not one single main character in the movie could act. Not one. It looked like a grade- school drama club.7: The "comedy". Every single joke fell flat. I didn't laugh once at anything they said. Many of the jokes were sexist, too. The trailer is a perfect summary of the movie. Every single joke was dumbed-down because Paul Feig has no respect for his audience.8: The entitlement. The cast and director have been throwing a hissy fit ever since people saw what garbage the first trailer was. They have been trying to claim that people who don't like the movie are sexists. No, no, no, no, and NO. People who think they are entitled to success because of their gender are sexist. The cast of this movie is sexist. The director of this movie is sexist. The people who hate this movie are NOT sexist.9: So boring. This movie didn't take any chances, and didn't expand the Ghostbusters universe in any way.10: The product placement. It was everywhere. There might not have been a single scene where they weren't advertising something in the background. It made me long for the days of Foodfight!In conclusion, nobody should every give their money to these lazy fatcats again. I for one am never buying another Sony product in my life. And if you pay to see this movie, you are a bad person.</p>
