<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As I watched the movie Bodas de sangre, I was completely disturbed. Although I like the Flamenco and appreciated how Carlos Saura, the director, incorporated it into the movie I wonder where some of the important themes went.  The movie shows the emotions of the characters through the Flamenco however it fails to touch on some of the most significant ideas of the play. This movie lacks the themes that made the play so compelling.  For instance, the importance of virginity, la honra, is totally forgotten.  We don't see the mother's disappointment with her son's choice of a wife because the girlfriend had another boyfriend.  Money and the desire for land are ignored as well as the significance of destiny.  The viewer never understands the importance of destiny in regards to Leonardo and the groom.  Also, the viewer cannot see that the characters in the book are nameless except for Leonardo. Maybe if I had not read the play before watching Bodas de sangre I wouldn't have been so disappointed.  I thought that the Flamenco was a useful tool for showing emotion but couldn't carry the entire movie.</p>
