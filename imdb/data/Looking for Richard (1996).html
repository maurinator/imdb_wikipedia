<h1>Looking for Richard (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Director Al Pacino juxtaposes scenes from Richard III, scenes of rehearsals for Richard III, and sessions where parties involved discuss the play, the times that shaped the play, and the events that happened at the time the play is set. Interviews with mostly British actors are also included, attempting to explain why American actors have more problems performing Shakespearean plays than they do.</p>
<p>Al Pacino's deeply-felt rumination on Shakespeare's significance and relevance to the modern world through interviews and an in-depth analysis of "Richard III."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Being an actor, thus not only interested in but bewitched by Shakespeare and his genius, this movie is a wonderful paper on how his text and drama applies to all in all times. Pacino with friends and colleagues Bulleit and Berry (I think) try to digest the soul of the words and make them digestible to the everyday Joe. It's a riveting tale of the grand emotions that we all possess, but rarely express in this time and age and I deeply thank Pacino and his magnificent crew for taking us on this journey. Keep an eye out for the beggar who - in an unprecedented and most sincere way - tells us how Shakespeare lets us in on the secret how life is supposed to be lived and then walks off-camera and asks a businessman for a penny. 10 out of 10. And thank you.</p>
