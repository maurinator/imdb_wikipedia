<h1>Held Up (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While they're on vacation in the Southwest, Rae finds out her man Michael spent their house money on a classic car, so she dumps him, hitching a ride to Vegas for a flight home. A kid promptly steals Michael's car, leaving him at the Zip & Sip, a convenience store. Three bumbling robbers promptly stage a hold up. Two take off with the cash stranding the third, with a mysterious crate, just as the cops arrive. The robber takes the store hostage. As incompetent cops bring in a SWAT team and try a by-the-book rescue, Michael has to keep the robber calm, find out what's in the crate, aid the negotiations, and get back to Rae. The Stockholm Syndrome asserts its effect.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The beautiful 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk is the best thing in this movie. The beginning has a few chuckles as Jamie Foxx's girlfriend, Nia Long, gets an education about 8 track players. Once the "Sip & Zip convenience store is taken over by some inept robbers, the movie begins a steady slide downhill. In other words, as the supposed hostage situation becomes more ridiculous, so does the film. None of the cast of misfit characters is developed, and the simplistic script is stretched beyond belief. It's almost like they said this is what we have, now what can we do with it? I absolutely will add "Held Up" to my DVD collection, but only because of the magnificent car. - MERK</p>
