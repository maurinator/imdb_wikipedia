<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this movie is overlooked as a great one. Great actors/actress and fantastic plot. It's one of my most favorite. The first three times I watched it I got new things out of it each time, so watch closely.Drug dealer gone straight, but no one believes him. His old friend from school is a cop now and he really doesn't believe him. Then there's the romance part with Michelle Pfiffer and she's so elegant in her part; like one of the great actresses of old. Then there's the drug and drug money problem that surfaces and the FBI get involved. It is quite involved and very interesting. Can't tell though, you must watch, you won't regret it. Watch it more than once.</p>
