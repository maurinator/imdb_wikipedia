<h1>Gulliver's Travels (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Part live-action and part-animated version of Gulliver's travels, especially his meeting with the tiny Lilliputians.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to disagree with the only comment listed. This movie is not the best adaptation of the novel by any means though it is significant in that it was one of the early movies to use animation to the effect seen in this move; that is, mixing real life actors with animated characters. It pulls this off spectacularly. The problem is more to do with the dialogue and pace which is, at times, tiring. I watched this as a child and always had a soft spot for it, as I now know other children to have the same. This isn't a horrible movie, it should certainly not be overlooked in my opinion. It certainly should be bought at a car-boot sale though!</p>
