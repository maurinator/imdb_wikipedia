<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bad Girls Go to Hell (1965) ** (out of 4) Doris Wishman directed this sexploitation cult classic, which is one of the better known films out there. A married but bored housewife gets raped by the apartment janitor and eventually kills him. She flees from the scene hoping to start a new life in NYC but everyone she meets either physically or sexually abuses her. Like many other sexploitation flicks, this one here was shot in grainy B&W without sound, which was later dubbed in. The best thing about this film is the pretty good, if rough, editing, which cuts to various scenes very well. This film was still early in the sex genre so there isn't too much nudity but Wishman plays with the viewer with her fast cuts and quit edits. There's not much that really goes on but I was still caught up in the film.</p>
