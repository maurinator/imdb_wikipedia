<h1>Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Megiddo is a supernatural ride into a world teetering on the edge of the Apocalypse. It follows the rise of a Machiavellian leader bent on amassing the armies of the world for the battle of Armageddon while calamities of Biblical proportions pummel the Earth. Though both prequel and sequel to The Omega Code, Megiddo works also as a stand alone story for anyone who missed its predecessor. For at its emotional core, Megiddo is the Caine and Abel story of the two men enamoured with the same woman, raised as brothers, who grew up to find themselves pitted against each other over the fate and souls of the entire world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's not very often you have a theater packed with people that applaud the ending of a movie simultaneously.  After the battle of Armaggedon Lucifer lost his battle and was sent to Hell!  All at the same time the people of God in the theater shouted with victory and applauded the defeat of Satan. One of the most moving movie experiences of my life!</p>
