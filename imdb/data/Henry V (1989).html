<p>Young King Henry of England invades France in order to claim his right to a kingdom and to the daughter of the King of France in this second film adaptation of the Shakespeare play. Henry's small but embattled army meet the French forces on the field of Agincourt.</p>
<p>The still young king of England, intending to tax the english church, is sent off to war by the bishops to enforce the (doubtful) claim to France. The King, thus sure of devine blessing for his cause, wages war on the French all too proud in overpowing strength. After the Battle of Agincourt, the French King has to yield his daughter as a peace offering. In a bitter satire, this political marriage is then portrayed as the happy ending joining the two recent lovers.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Hundred Years' War in 1415, the young King Henry V of England embarks on the conquest of France.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I admit that bringing Shakespeare to the big screen is tough. There are subtleties and nuances - and limitations - about stage productions that cinema simply can't capture. That being said, this is by far the best adaptation of Shakespeare to the big screen of the past fifteen years. The director does an admirable job of making every scene seem plausible - with slight suspension of disbelief - on stage.Kenneth Branagh, while he strikes me as a bit full of himself, is fantastic as the young, vain, ambitious title character, while Paul Scofield, Henry's French counterpart, delivers an equally impressive performance as the king who understands the gravity of Henry's invasion of France.Aside from Shakespeare's obvious bias toward British interests - which have little to do with the big-screen production - this is an amazing film.</p>
