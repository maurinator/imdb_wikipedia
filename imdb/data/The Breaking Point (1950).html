<h1>The Breaking Point (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fishing boat captain Harry Morgan charters his boat. Due to strained finances, he is none too careful as to whom he does business with. Real trouble erupts when Harry hires out his boat to transport four men who turn out to be criminals on the lam from a racetrack heist.</p>
<p>In true Hollywood fashion, Warner Bros. bought the film rights to Hemingway's novel "To Have and Have Not," used the title for a follow-up to "Casablanca" with Humphrey Bogart, then filmed the plot as "The Breaking Point" with John Garfield. Bogart's fans probably would not have accepted him as Hemingway's anti-hero, which fit Garfield's persona perfectly.</p>
<p>An otherwise moral captain of a charter boat becomes financially strapped and is drawn into illegal activities in order to keep up payments on his boat.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>No one played the haunted/hunted character better than John Garfield (Humphrey Bogart is a close second).  Here, Garfield is a boat captain that gets in way over his head.  The thing with Garfield's characters, is that even though the audience sympathizes with his plight, the character always brings it on himself.  With Garfield's usual acerbic delivery, his Harry Morgan is hard to like but when he is with his family, one sees that he is basically a headstrong but good guy.  Even though Michael Curtiz directed this, the tone and especially the ending shot kept reminding me of Fritz Lang.  I think this film should be commended for the ending, which although a somewhat happy one, reminds the audience of the affect of one's actions on everyone.  This generally was ignored in a lot of the crime dramas from the 30's to the 60's.  My only complaint is the Patricia Neal character seemed tacked on for romance sake.  She didn't add much and certainly didn't have an impact on the main thrust of the story.  But that is a minor quibble. Another gem for one of the move overlooked actors - John Garfield.</p>
