<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like it, I like it, yes indeed!With a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney plot, this movie takes a terrific comic and musical turn and is a totally enjoyable, fun, and informative ride!I liked that Jack Black always treated his students with positive reinforcement, which is really important if someone is ever to have the guts to go on stage. He was never down or discouraging unless it was a very funny down anddiscouraging! And never about the students themselves.I like Jack Black, I love this movie, and I love rock'n'roll above all else!Forget the clich√©s. Let yourself have fun.And stick it to the man!!!!!!</p>
