<h1>Another Way (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Political and sexual repression in Hungary, just after the revolution of 1956. In 1958, the body of Eva Szalanczky, a political journalist, is discovered near the border. Her friend Livia is in hospital with a broken neck; Livia's husband, Donci, is under arrest. In a flashback to the year before, we see what leads up to the tragedy. Eva gets a job as a writer. She meets Livia and is attracted to her. Livia feels much the same, but as a married woman, has doubts and hesitations. In their work, they (and Eva in particular) bang up against the limits of telling political truths; in private, they confront the limits of living out sexual and emotional truth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw "Another Way" in 1982 in a small London art cinema. Set in Hungary in 1958, it conveys something of the tedium of life there and then, and in an age when lesbianism is no longer a dangerous secret, the tension of a relationship needing to be kept under wraps is brilliantly conveyed. Grazyna Szapolowska - is there a more beautiful woman anywhere is the world? plays the woman who is apparently happily married to a Hungarian armyofficer, who finds herself strangely attracted to the new arrival at the office. I will say no more of the plot in case you have a chance to see this moody but magnificent film. Gabor Reviczky portrays the kind of young man to whom a bottle is the answer to all life's problems, and Josef Kroner is the editor of the magazine who may appear to be housetrained by the Communist party but is actually a rebel in his own right. Hardly a feelgood movie, but when you need a cry this is not to be ignored.</p>
