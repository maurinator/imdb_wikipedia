<h1>Party Monster (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in the New York club scene of the late 1980's thru the 1990's, a tale which is based on the rise and fall of club-kid promoter Michael Alig, a party organizer, whose extravagant life was sent spiralling downward when he boasted on television that he had killed his friend, roommate, and drug dealer, Angel Melendez. Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York, and came to be an underground legend, known for his excessive drug use and outrageous behavior in the club world. At his peak, he had his own record label, and magazine, and hosted Disco 2000, one of the biggest club nights in New York in the '90s. He was doing a lot of drugs, and as his addiction got worse, his party themes became darker and more twisted. Alig's saga reached its tragic crescendo when he viciously murdered his drug dealer, Angel, by injecting him with Drano and throwing him in the East River. The power he wielded on the club scene made him feel untouchable, so he didn't hesitate to boast of the murder. The press thought it was a publicity stunt--until Angel's body washed ashore.</p>
<p>Based on the true story of Michael Alig, a Club Kid party organizer whose life was sent spiraling down when he bragged on television about killing his drug dealer and roommate.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The events described in Party Monster were the "in" thing in the eighties and nineties. Club kids dressing up in drag, doing drugs, and partying all night with no sexual preference were all hot. Party Monster describes the life Michael Alig had when he became a club kid after being orientated by a fellow club kid named James St. James.The two clicked, they started doing massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and soon enough, it led to the murder of Alig's drug dealer in 1996 landing him in prison till his release date on November 30, 2013. The film is based on the novel Disco Bloodbath (now under the name Party Monster) by James St. James. It's a biography of both himself and Alig and their friendship and its spiral to chaos and narcissism.Seeing a photo of the film a few years ago I couldn't believe it. Before I became an avid writer and film watcher I used to look at things from a small minded point of view. Kind of like, if it isn't normal it isn't worth my time researching. I've always had a quirky interest, but nothing quite like this. Researching more on Alig's history and finding Culkin to be a great actor I decided to finally track down a copy and watch this. I had great fun taking a walk down the opposite side of the road.Macaulay Culkin is truly remarkable in this film. It was his first film since the 1994 dud Richie Rich. For the people who saw this film at the time of its release showed us that Macaulay Culkin is no longer a kid. He was an adult capable of quirky roles like his one in Saved! more recently. Party Monster proves that just doing slapstick Home Alone and its sequel weren't the maximum of his abilities. He could do so much more. He just needed the proper role.In the eighties and nineties, it was common for a man to dress like a woman wearing fluffy, feathery costumers with lipstick and hairspray and still being heterosexual. It wasn't as strange as it seems today. It was sort of what all the oddballs were doing. Some still doing it. James St. James has become a club kid icon and appears sometimes as a guest judge on America's Next Top Model. It seems he gets farther in life and doesn't care about Michael Alig anymore.The film shows how Michael Alig truly was. He acted like a spoiled rich kid who thought the world revolved around him. All Michael all the time. But after his murder landed him in prison we haven't got a clear explanation about him or if he changed his ways at all.Party Monster is a shocker. It's something different, but a vital see for people who want to be exposed to something "different." It's a strange little movie with powerful performances and an involving storyline. It is a little walk down the lane your parents warned you about.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green, Wilmer Valderrama, Wilson Cruz, and Marylin Manson. Directed by: Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.</p>
