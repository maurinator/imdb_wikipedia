<h1>Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Johnny Destiny burns into Las Vegas in his hot Plymouth RoadRunner, stopping only to pick up a stranger stranded in the desert. But then, things aren't always as they seem. Anything can happen in that town of many possibilities...especially since there's been some weird electrical disturbances. As the stranger, fresh out of prison, tries to put his life back together--to recover his money from an old bank heist and the girl he lost in doing the job--something keeps interfering with his plans. Is it fate...or just Destiny?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Destiny is one of those films that is neither great nor terrible. Taranitno is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. But his acting abilities are very limited. The story is sort of creative, but at the same time trying to be a indie film too hard. James Belushi puts on a good performance that seems almost related to his character in "About Last Night" but with a more violent twist. And you can't forget Allen Garfield, terrific guy. But, this film will merely exists. Don't over emphasize the meaning of this film based merely on the existence of Quentin Tarantino. Only Quentin knows why he did this terrible movie, don't try and rationalize Quentin. This film is an example of Quentin's personality. He does whatever the hell he wants to.</p>
