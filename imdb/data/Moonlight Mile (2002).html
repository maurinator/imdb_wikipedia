<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is undeniably an emotional twister ride, but it makes you want to ride it again.  This movie has a similar theme to In The Bedroom. Imagine a movie that deals with death as a part of life, grief with comfort in others, anger of loss.  Imagine a movie that deals with relationships between strangers and family, love and hate.  Imagine the struggle between accountability and being hurtful, living your life for someone else to help them and fulfilling your desires......now imagine that the movie is not the waste of time In the Bedroom was and you've got THE MOONLIGHT MILE. (does this speech remind you of Matthew McConaughey in A Time To Kill?  I hope so) OK.  This movie is fantastic.  It is worth seeing.  It has Susan Sarandon's best performance since Dead Man Walking.  Dustin Hoffman is steady as a rock throughout and Jake Gyllenhaal seems as if he stumbles into nailing the role perfectly.  And Ellen Pompeo is such a natural beauty.  This is a much more upbeat way of dealing with the only guarantee in life (which is death) than in the bedroom, city of angels (which is also done by brad siberling) or anything else I've seen recently.  It is very real and honest and not enough movies can be this way....deeply depressing for moments, hopeful for others, and times where you're not sure how they'll react.  But everything fits. It has a great script and the soundtrack is really fitting for the movie. I'm not sure what the hell the user Li-1 was talking about when he said this movie's soundtrack was a ripoff of American Beauty....NONE OF THE SONGS ARE THE SAME EINSTEIN!!! I'm giving this movie a 10/10 even though it's really a 9/10 because other people leaving reviews are not rating it accurately.RENT THIS MOVIE.  WATCH IT TWICE.</p>
