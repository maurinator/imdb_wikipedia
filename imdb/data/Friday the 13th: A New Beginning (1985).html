<h1>Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Five years after killing the goalie hockey-masked killer Jason Voorhees, Tommy Jarvis has grown up in various mental hospitals unable to get over the nightmares about Jason's return. When Tommy is sent to a rural halfway house in New Jersey for mentally disturbed teenagers, a series of grisly murders begin anew as another hockey-masked killer begins killing off all people at and around the residence. Has Jason returned from the dead to re-start his killing spree? Has Tommy decided to take over the reign of Jason, or has someone else?</p>
<p>Still haunted by his past, Tommy Jarvis - who, as a child, killed Jason Voorhees - wonders if the serial killer is connected to a series of brutal murders occurring in and around the secluded halfway house where he now lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We know from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I like it enough, but I don't think it's great or all that really good. I will never understand the hate for this movie. Still haunted by his gruesome past, Tommy Jarvis - the boy who killed Jason Voorhees - wonders if somehow he is connected to brutal slayings occurring in and around the secluded halfway house where he now lives. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements. My final rating is 7/10. ( I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.)</p>
