<h1>Neighbours (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film, shot in pixilation (a kind of stop-motion animation with actors), is about two neighbours who come to barbaric blows over a flower that straddles the property line.</p>
<p>In a minimalistic suburban landscape of surreal proportions, identical houses materialize. These two residences are accompanied by materializing leisure chairs. The chairs become occupied by two male individuals who are smoking pipes and reading newspapers. It becomes apparent that they are a depiction of a somewhat identical pair, akin to twins or even suggesting a mirror image of lives. A careful reading of the news headlines reads "War certain if no peace" and conversely "Peace is certain if no war". Next, the two characters are startled by the sudden appearance of a single, lovely flowering plant, which grows instantly in the center of their post-modern mystical world. They approach the flower and are mesmerized. The fragrance causes some sort of psychedelic or euphoric effect. One man disappears off screen and the other one goes into hallucination and sensory bliss. They then are carried away into a mutual dance of joy and harmony, due to an appreciation of the flower's potent blessings. Gradually though, there comes trouble in paradise, because the two neighbors start a quarrel over this single plant. It essentially boils down to control and access to this prized resource. The argument escalates into a boundary dispute, as they try to demonstrate to one another, where the correct (yet imaginary) property lines divide the landscape. It is a fight to own the land from which the flower is growing, to prove definite ownership based upon real estate law. A violent struggle ensues when they cannot agree to where the property line actually divides the once-idyllic landscape. They use the pieces of the fence to strike at each other, sparring in a combative duel. An all-out brawl leads to serious injuries for both individuals. It then expands into a war upon their households. They kill each others' wives and their babies by brutal murder, kicking and striking with blunt instruments in the process. After the utter destruction of their homes, they demolish each other in an exhaustive battle. They collapse in death throes, ironically on the opposite side of the fence from their original positions in the leisure chairs. The soil and the scattered fence pieces move around into makeshift graves, with two crosses formed as grave-markers. Finally, the plant splits into two flowers and takes root into both of their graves. The two men are representative of Europe and the U.S. during World War II. The main difference between the characters, being in their dress; one has a necktie and one has a bow tie. Their struggle, as the struggle of empires, is over the goodness and bounty of the Earth and deciding who will rule over it. The outcome is utter failure for both parties, who insist on the struggle when they could instead enjoy all the good things together, as the middle of the movie depicts through their harmonious euphoric dance. This story is a cinematic folk tale using post-modern symbolism. It is a statement against ownership and greed. It concludes with a simple, religious statement, "Love Your Neighbor".</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a rather heavy-handed but well made animated short about war. While the message is presented through "sledgehammer symbolism" (i.e., it wasn't exactly subtle), the film's stop-motion cinematography was very nice and well done. It certainly is interesting.The movie begins with two normal looking 1950s era guy sitting outside their cutout homes. Both are sitting in lounge chairs reading their newspapers (which, in a not so subtle move, have headlines about war). Then, suddenly, a flower appears on the border of their yards and both think it's the most wonderful flower in the world. However, because they both love it so much, they begin fighting over it--almost like in a Tom & Jerry movie! At first, it's kind of funny, but when it degenerates to attacking their wives and babies, the joke is over. Ultimately, it ends on a very fitting note.</p>
