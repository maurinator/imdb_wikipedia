<h1>Godzilla vs. Megaguirus (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Godzilla returns to terrorize Japan! This time, however, Japan has two new weapons to defend themselves. The Gryphon, a high-tech ship, and the Dimension Tide, a device that creates artificial black holes! During a test of the Dimension Tide, eggs appear in the city of Shibuya and hatch into terrifying Meganurons! These creatures need water to grow and flood the city of Shibuya by breaking underground water veins. As they multiply and grow, they start to feed on the energy of humans. After gathering enough energy, they transform in to giant dragonfly monsters called Meganuras! And now they target Godzilla for energy to feed to the larva of their queen, which eventually hatches into the terrifying 60-meter Megaguirus who also begins to attack Godzilla for his energy. Now a 3-way battle between Godzilla, the Megaguirus, and humans begins! Will Godzilla win? Will humanity survive?</p>
<p>When Japan's new Black Hole machine spawns a race of killer insects, they set their sights on Godzilla, collecting enough energy until, their queen, Megagurius, arises hell bent on becoming the dominant species, even if it means going up against Godzilla</p>
<p>Japan creates an artificial black hole device to trap Godzilla forever, but a test of the device creates new foes for Godzilla, car-sized dragonflies called meganula and their queen, Megaguirus.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A godzilla movie harking back to the glory days of the 60's.  The whole movie is one glorious work of art.  You have the military trying to get rid of Godzilla by blasting him with a BLACK HOLE weapon, which unleashes giant dragonflies.  Part of tokyo is flooded by these creatures as they spwan Megagirus, the big motha dragonfly.  The ending fight of the two is just classic, espically when godzilla BODY SLAM'S Megagirus.  JUST GREAT!. Hopefully Sony releases this thing localy so that everyone can see how a godzilla movie should be done.</p>
