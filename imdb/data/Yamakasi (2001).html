<h1>Yamakasi (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gravity or Police, these guys don't believe in any law. Idolised by the youth of Paris as much as they're hated by the police, they are the Yamakasis, modern samurais. With acrobatic skillfulness and adrenaline pumping belief in their own immortality, they throw themselves out from incredible heights, and jump from roof to roof. Locked doors and "No Trespassing"-signs become irresistible challenges. But one day, whilst mimicking one of the Yamakasi's more dangerous stunts, a young fan gets injured. Only one operation can save the boy, an operation that his family can't afford.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A movie that gets more rating mainly because of the spectacular athletic performance of the stunt-men and actors as well and less for the story.anyway..a great way to spend your day watching a movie like this...i always liked stories with multiple characters and developments and i must say that this is one of the best for me. i haven't seen yet part two..i will soon but won't raise my expectations so i won't feel bad after. a great similarity to another french movie Banieue 13 made me want to see this movie and i'm glad i did. PS: Don't try it at home...and i don't mean just kids :)Well deserved 9 stars for showing us there's no boundary when u want ! Enjoy !</p>
