The winning team gets all the money, the rest get nothing.</p>
<p>To inherit a fortune, various addressees of a will must compete in a wild scavenger hunt to collect selected items, but cannot be simply bought.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fun, adventurous, witty movie that the gang will love. In tradition of the original "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and the "Cannonball Run" series, this is another fun movie where you see your favorite t.v. stars of the 70's in situations that you normally wouldn't see them in. It's great comedy and you don't have to worry about harsh language and the adult humor you would see in more recent movies of the same sort. It's a good summer movie for the whole family to watch on a Saturday afternoon. You'll be surprised at who you will see in the film.</p>
