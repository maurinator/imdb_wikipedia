<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented this film because of the legendary cast. Michael biehn, nic cage, Angus scrimm-the tall man himself, Charlie sheen, Talia shire, and peter Fonda. But even an eccentric and solid cast couldn't save dead fall. The acting is some of the weakest I've seen from these actors. Nic cage goes gonzo over the top, so much so that he is the only redeemable thing in the movie. Michael biehn is solid but he seems very bored. It features lobster hands, twin brothers, a really cheese narration, one of the lamest and unerotic sex scenes ever filmed, death by deep fryer, and Charlie sheen looking sexual. Overall, interesting cast cant redeem a clich√©d and slow thriller without any thrills.</p>
