<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Truly one of the best of the 80's horror-esque films,  House uses a unique blend of suspense, horror, and humor to create a quite enjoyable movie experience.  House is definatly the best film of William Katt's career(well known for his work in the Perry Mason made for TV movies) In House,  he plays a recently divorced man who is haunted by the disappearence of his son.  In order to get back on track,  he returns to the site of his son's dissapearence,  a supposedly "haunted" house which was left to him.  Of course,  things go arwy,  and soon he is plauged by an obnoxious neighbor(played fantasticly by George Wendt) and several strange ghosts and ghouls intent on playing with his fragile sanity.  There are some really errie moments,  but the film as a whole maintains a playful atmosphere. This is a movie that depending on your mood will either have you jumping in your seat, laughing your head off, or both.  Definately worth the hour and a half.  I would reccomend this to anyone who likes to lie down, relax,  and be entertained.  9/10 Stars. Have fun.</p>
