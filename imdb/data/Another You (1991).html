<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After 3 successful collaborations together, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor came together for the final time in Maurice Phillips's 1991 film Another You. The two definitely did not save the best for last in this story of mistaken identity. Maybe it was a case of wearing out a good thing, or poor directing, or something else entirely; whatever it was, Another You didn't work. After being in a mental hospital for 3 years, for his pathological lying, it is believed that George (Gene Wilder) is ready to be re- introduced to the world again. Eddie Dash (Richard Pryor) is a con- man trying to stay on the rehabilitated side of life when he is assigned to community service for the remainder of his probation. He is assigned to spend time with George, helping him find an apartment and aid him on his re-introduction to life outside of the mental hospital. On the way to the museum, George bumps into a man who mistakenly believes he is a millionaire to whom he owes a lot of money. George is wholeheartedly against going on with this lie as he is trying to rehabilitate himself from lying. Eddie, however, has no interest in becoming a better person and leaving the con game behind. Seeing this as a great opportunity for getting a lot of money, Eddie urges George to go along with the charade. George then meets the real Abe Fielding's wife and sees the beautiful mansion that he is supposed to live in. Going along with the charade proves difficult when it is revealed that the real Abe Fielding is missing and believed to be murdered. Everything about this film was disjointed. It's hard to believe, by watching this film alone, that there were 3 other film collaborations of the two principles. Another You is completely missable, likewise, miserable. A flat storyline that never fully develops or works enough to engage the audience, even my intense love of Gene Wilder's work wasn't enough to save this picture for me.</p>
