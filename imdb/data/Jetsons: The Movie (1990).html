<h1>Jetsons: The Movie (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Jetsons have made their film debut in a film about family, friends, and all that stuff. George's tightwad boss, Mr. Spacely, is determined to get his remote factor on his ore asteroid miles away to make 1,000,000 sprocketts, but all the vice-presidents sent to run it have disappeared for some reason, so Mr. Spacely must find someone else to run it: it would have to be someone mighty brave, and mighty stupid. So who does he pick? George Jetson. So George packs up his family: Jane, his sensible and loving wife; Judy- his rebellious teenage daughter who's gotten a new boyfriend: a super galactical rock star; Elroy- basketball champ who's losing faith in his father; and Rosie, his sassy maid. So while Judy meets another boy and enjoys a huge shopping mall, George sets off to work with his new friend, a robot foreman named Rudy 2. The factory is soon sabotaged on opening day, so George intends to investigate and disappears. So it's up to Elroy and his new friends to rescue George. Along for the ride are Judy and Jane. A wild futuristic romp on a screen bigger than your TV.</p>
<p>George Jetson gets a job offer: he can run his own sprocket factory. However, the factory is on some distant planet and he's not the first employee from Spacely Sprockets inc. to be sent to the factory. It turns out that the plant is sabotaged because it affects the caves underneath. How does George satisfy his boss and stops the plant from destroying the land of the creatures living below the factory?</p>
<p>George Jetson is forced to uproot his family when Mr. Spacely promotes him to take charge of a new factory on a distant planet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me tell you, when I was a little girl, I HATED "The Jetsons" (even though they were re-runs put on tv like most old tv shows are now these days).  I thought that the show was boring and too lame, and for that, I had no interest in seeing this movie.  However, when I was at a slumber party one of my childhood friends was throwing for her birthday, they rented "Jetsons:  The Movie", and from what I heard from one of the girls was that the movie was good.  So, I thought, "Well, we'll see!"Actually, it was better than I thought!  Former teenage sensation, Tiffany, updated Judy Jetson to the 1990's, and I loved most of the songs that were in this movie!  I found this movie really interesting and I loved it!  I still do!  It's a great idea to bring this movie into the 1990's since the show is from the 1960's (or somewhat around that time?) and obviously, the actual show is quite corny if you ask me.I really liked "Jetsons: The Movie".  I was very pleased with it!!!! :o)</p>
