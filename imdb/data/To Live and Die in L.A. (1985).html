<h1>To Live and Die in L.A. (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Working largely in cases of counterfeiting, LA based Secret Service agent Richie Chance exhibits reckless behavior which according to his longtime and now former partner Jimmy Hart will probably land him in the morgue before he's ready to retire. That need for the thrill manifests itself in his personal life by his love of base jumping. Professionally, it is demonstrated by the fact that he is sextorting a parolee named Ruth Lanier, who feeds him information in return for he not sending her back to prison for some trumped up parole violation. With his new partner John Vukovich, Chance is more determined than ever based on recent circumstances to nab known longtime counterfeiter Ric Masters, who is more than willing to use violence against and kill anyone who crosses him. Masters is well aware that the Secret Service is after him. Masters' operation is somewhat outwardly in disarray, with Chance being able to nab his mule, Carl Cody, in the course of moving some of the fake money, and one of his associates, a lawyer named Max Waxman, probably stealing money from him. Partly with information from Ruth, Chance is trying to find and exploit the weaknesses in Masters' operation. To accomplish his goal, Chance takes more and more unethical and illegal measures, which may be problematic for Vukovich, who comes from a family of police officers who are sworn to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Two cops in Los Angeles try to track down the vicious criminal Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe). Then, one of them is killed by Masters and the other one swears revenge no matter what the cost. After that, the hunt becomes an ob- session and the law he once swore to uphold becomes meaningless to him.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This story is very 80's, and is heavily influenced by the TV show Miami Vice.  The style, clothes, music, and characters reflect that time period exactly.  The direction of this film gives a slick feel; where its action, style, and seedy underside all blend in well.     The story could be very predictable, but with its plots twists, and the theme that follows the saying be careful when you go hunting for monster not to become one yourself gives it originality.  It has some mind blowing stunts that create tension, and if you watch the film Ronin you see where they got the car chase idea from.   In all this film gives a feeling of being involved in events that go too fast, too dangerous, and too twisted.  Its shows what happens to the heart when the individual becomes obsessed with what he seeks.  Watch this one and love it.</p>
