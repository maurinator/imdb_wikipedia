<h1>Switchblade Sisters (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The "Dagger Debs" are a gang of snarling girls, and Maggie is their newest member. Lace, the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts --it seems Lace's man, Dominic, head of the "Silver Daggers" fancies the new recruit. Lace struggles to keep control of the Debs, and a handle on Nick, as they face off against the rival gang of pushers lead by Crabs.</p>
<p>The Silver Daggers are a gang of young hoods who control an inner-city high school, where they sell drugs and sex to the student body and fight anyone who gets in their way. The Daggers have a ladies' auxiliary, The Dagger Debs, who rumble just as hard as the men, but one day chief Dagger Deb Lace meets her match in Maggie, a new kid who won't back down. When a scuffle lands Maggie and the Debs in jail for the night, Maggie comes to Lace's rescue, and Maggie becomes Lace's new right-hand woman. However, fellow Deb Patch is jealous of Maggie's friendship with Lace, and begins spinning a web of deceit to destroy Lace's trust in the new deb. In the midst of the infighting, the Silver Daggers find their turf challenged by a rival gang who pose as a community action team, and the Debs join forces with a revolutionary political group.</p>
<p>The leader of an inner city girl gang is challenged when a new girl moves into the neighbourhood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a VERY cheesy movie, but in a great way that makes you laugh WITH the movie and not feel stupid. The movie is entertaining all the way and there's not one boring moment in it. I just love this movie! The fact that it's old only makes it look more stylish. Just wait untill you meet those nasty gang girls! Rent the movie and see it with your friends for a great night at home!</p>
