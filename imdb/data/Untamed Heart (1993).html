<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this film for the first time and I was upset by the way the film started at the beginning because it wasn't what I expected at all.I didn't know what kind of film it was not having seen or heard of it before and I thought it to be all about a woman taming a man and finding love.As the film progressed it was so full of love and romance, fun, laughter, two people enjoying each others friendship and growing into more, just wonderful.I was devastated at the happenings within the film the brutality as well as the goodness within it but the originality of almost real life was what made the film believable.I expected a very happy ending and it took me ages to stop crying because I have a friend who had a similar experience.It is a beautiful film and quite comparable in a way to love story.A love for another human being that was unsurpassable.I would recommend anyone who has even a hard heart to watch this film.I absolutely loved the film and the actors were just superb.</p>
