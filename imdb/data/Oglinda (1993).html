<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>the good intentions are the basis of each Sergiu Nicolaescu films. in the case of Oglinda , the work about a delicate subject, the ambition to recreate a large historical fresco , the desire to use the film for support own ideas is not really easy or convincing. something missing. and this absence does entire film a kind of wax museum , with many statues, mechanical speeches, words as ash and confuse message. result a demonstration who not defines reality but impose thesis. the saviorof the film - Ștefan Radof as Iuliu Maniu. he has the desire and courage and science to do a realistic character, to give a coherent message and to define the atmosphere of period in its key elements. Adrian Vîlcu as the king Mihai is not in the most favorable position. because his character is to far by the original model in attitude and decisions. and because Nicolaescu desire is too Utopian - to create a gallery of heroes.</p>
