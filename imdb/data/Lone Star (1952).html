<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I afraid even with the starpower involved in this one since there's not much they can do with a poor script.Convoluted plot about the annexation of Texas into the union, it involves the opposing forces of Gable and Broderick Crawford in a fight to see whether Texas will become a state, or an independent republic.Although there's plenty of action, too much of the film gets bogged down in the romance between Gable and Gardner.  I guess MGM needed another vehicle for the two of them after THE HUCKSTERS (1947) or MOGAMBO (1953) And the battle scene and what happens to Crawford at the end is unreal. It turns into a 'Let's all unite for Texas' kinda of a thing that looks implausible, especially after what's been going on for the previous 94 minutes.If they had a better script it might have turned out to be something more entertaining.  4 out of 10</p>
