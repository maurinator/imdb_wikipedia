<h1>Love Me If You Dare (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Julien Janvier lost his mother young, drifted apart from his working class father and ever closer to confident Sophie Kowalsky, the Polish class outsider. Their dares game, symbolized by an interchanged music-box, grows ever bolder, regardless of harm to others and each-other. In his college years, it even suspends their relationship and toys with their marriages, but they are drawn back to each-other irresistibly.</p>
<p>As adults, best friends Julien and Sophie continue the odd game they started as children -- a fearless competition to outdo one another with daring and outrageous stunts. While they often act out to relieve one another's pain, their game might be a way to avoid the fact that they are truly meant for one another.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is really surprising to see the ratings some movies get. As I write this "Jeux d'enfants" has got a 7.6 on IMDb. I don't get it. The story is obnoxious. I do not really understand why the do what they do. It makes no sense. They seem to be crazy children all their lives. I hate the main characters. I wanted them to die at every chance they had, and there were some.That would have conveniently shortened this awful movie. This movie reminds someone of Amelie? Well, maybe because they speak French too. If you like this movie I do not want to meet you, thanks. I do not understand why IMDb chops my comments and then says I need to write more. It had 10 lines when I wrote it. Now I must seem like a rabid maniac who does not know about paragraphs and full stops...</p>
