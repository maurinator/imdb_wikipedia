<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all, I've never seen the title "Kurenai no buta" except on IMDb. The English title on my copy and all other references I've found on the web are "Porco Rosso". Outside Japan, that's the title to look for at the video store. Let's see what we've got: an Italian Pig speaking Japanese, "Knock your socks off" aerial vistas, not one but two beautiful heroines, an Adriatic hotel that's actually a small island, better dialog than many "live" movies, sky pirates, even good music. How many films can claim all that? Perhaps the most attractive character of the film, after you've gotten past the many obvious ones, is Myazaki's amazing imagination which pervades all aspects of the production.To me, the storyline is reminiscent of Hollywood's Golden Age. The characters are wonderful, even to an adult audience and, of course, high quality animation is the frosting on the cake.After seeing Porco Rosso, I bought the DVD, and I hardly ever do that!</p>
