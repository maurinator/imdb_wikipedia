<h1>The Group (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's 1933, and eight young women are friends and members of the upper- class group at a private girl's school, about to graduate and start their own lives. The film documents the years between their graduation and the beginning of the World War in Europe, and shows, in a serialized style, their romances and marriages, their searches for careers or meaning in their lives, their highs and their lows.</p>
<p>The lives of a group of eight friends, who are seen as the aesthetes of the Vassar class of 1933, are presented from their graduation, when their lives held so much promise despite the Depression, to the start of WWII. Ambitious theater major Kay, somewhat the outsider of the group, decides to get married immediately and support her struggling playwright husband Harald by getting a job at Macy's than pursue her own theater directing career. Kay, who takes everything personally, needs to be in control, which becomes more difficult as problems emerge in the marriage and as world events occur around her. The only one who may be more ambitious is English major Libby, who wants a job in publishing and whose bravada hides her insecurities when not getting what she wants. The exact opposite is Dottie, an inexperienced proper Bostonian who may settle for second best much as she strove for what she really wanted despite she coming to the understanding that she was less than second best. Chemistry major Polly, who wanted to be a doctor but becomes a medical technician, deals with people with real or perceived psychological problems, both at work and in her personal life. Politically involved Priss knows that love and politics may not mesh, but doesn't like feeling like a science experiment as a replacement to love. Artist Helena, who plans on becoming a nursery school teacher, is the communicator who reports the goings-on of her friends to their other classmates. Wealthy Pokey can afford a life of leisure in marriage, for which she strives. And beautiful art history major Lakey, who can get any man she wants, heads to Europe following graduation to further her art history experience, but her trip may be as much to get away from her Vassar life and head for freedom.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a thoroughly enjoyable reworking of Mary McCarthy's book...while certain portions of the story & dialog are toned down from the frank & sexual novel, the gist remains intact. The story of a group of protected collegiate girls during the Depression being plunged into real life...marriage, affairs, career paths, utter meltdown. It's got a definite soap-opera feel & the performances get a bit cartoony here & there, but this movie is a JOY. Just enjoy it for what it is...a couple (plus) hours of fun & involving storytelling, great performances, great clothes, & goofy upper-crust female bonding.</p>
