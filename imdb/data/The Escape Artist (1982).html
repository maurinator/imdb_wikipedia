<h1>The Escape Artist (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The young and self-confident Danny blufs at the local police-station that he will escape out of prison within one hour. What follows is a flashback about his childhood with his uncle and aunt, which are 'vaudeville'-artists themselves. We also follow the problems of Danny with the corrupt son of the mayor.</p>
<p>Danny Masters, teen-aged son of the late Harry Masters, the "greatest escape artist except for Houdini," leaves home to join Uncle Burke and Aunt Sibyl (formerly called Louise) in their magic/mentalist act. Sibyl welcomes him; Burke is unenthusiastic. Danny is himself an accomplished magician and escape artist. He soon finds himself embroiled with Stu Quinones, over-the-edge son of Mayor Leon Quinones. The quest for a missing wallet with "hot" bills inside (pocket-picked by Danny) leads to the comeuppance of the crooked mayor and -- separately -- of his vindictive and out-of-control son. Along the way, Danny comes to terms with the death of his father, the circumstances of which he did not previously know.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I forgot to mention the wonderful haunting score by Georges  Delerue. The main theme has a sad music box quality to it -  gives a sort of a longing childhood feeling....VERY effective.</p>
