<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A straightforward biopic of the infamous Kray twins, a pair of gangsters who ruled London's East End in the 1950s and 1960s. For a film made in 1990, THE KRAYS is certainly a grisly tale in places, with unflinching depictions of the kind of psychotic violence that the brothers were known for.It's also solidly made, a decent biopic that attempts to flesh out the characters and their milieu in detail without an extra-long running time. I think the biggest coup was in casting pop star duo Gary and Martin Kemp as the titular characters; their acting is perfectly adequate for the role and it's hard to imagine who else would have fit the bill quite so well. Billie Whitelaw (TWISTED NERVE) also gives an impressive turn as their crazed mother.The script is strong and realistic, depicting the passing of the years in pre and post-WW2 London with skill, and the casting director has a keen eye for finding memorable actors. The sub-plot, involving Reggie's wife Frances, is particularly well handled with unlikely sensibility. My only issue is that the film runs out of time at the end, not even depicting the crucial arrests that led to the brothers' downfall; an extra 20 minutes at the climax would have made all the difference.</p>
