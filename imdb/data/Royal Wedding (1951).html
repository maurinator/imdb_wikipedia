<h1>Royal Wedding (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom and Ellen Bowen are a brother and sister dance act whose show closes in New York. Their agent books them in London for the same period as the Royal Wedding. They travel by ship where Ellen meets and becomes involved with Lord John Brindale. This causes her to miss a rehearsal. Tom (Astaire) uses the time to dance with a hat rack and gym equipment. Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Anne. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are in-the-clouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way, there is a vaudeville-style dance number in their show that features slapstick. It's a hoot.</p>
<p>Stage stars Tom and Ellen Bowen embark to open their show in England. Innocent-seeming Ellen is a female Don Juan and doesn't take dancing as seriously as brother Tom; on shipboard she meets her match, Lord John Brindale. Arrived in London, confirmed bachelor Tom auditions and is taken with cool dancer Anne Ashmond. Will romance break up the act?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wouldn't waste the keystrokes to comment on the trite story in ROYAL WEDDING.  Worse, Sarah Churchill can't dance and has no chemistry with Fred Astaire.  HOWEVER, Jane Powell is WONDERFUL as Astaire's sister. She's even more impressive here than in the wonderful SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.  And, OH! THOSE DANCE NUMBERS.  Astaire's singles numbers are the BEST dancing I've ever seen in a movie.  His numbers with Powell are equally marvelous.  Great music, great songs.  Forget the romance (and weak comedy with Keenan Wynn) and enjoy the music and dance.  SUPERFINE!</p>
