<h1>Houseboat (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Winters, a widower, is trying to understand and raise three precocious children alone. He gets a little unexpected help from Cinzia, when the children decide she is be the new maid. She is actually an Italian socialite who is trying to get away from her overprotective father.</p>
<p>Upon the sudden death of his estranged and nearly divorced wife, absentee father Tom claims ownership of his three children, seemingly more out of spite against his in-laws than out of consideration for his kids. When youngest son Robert runs off in reaction, he's returned by spoiled brat socialite Cinzia, itching to escape her orchestral conductor father's dictates. Being much a willful child herself, she harmonizes immediately with the kids and, needing a hideout, agrees to be hired on as their nanny. Finding their new house destroyed by a lustful, careless and irresponsible Italian handyman, the five decide to live on the man's neglected and dilapidated houseboat rather than rightfully sue him and take rooms at a hotel. As Cinzia bridges the gap between Tom and his kids, (while starting to learn how to cook and clean), Tom's newly divorced sister-in-law Carolyn makes a play for him. He accepts her proposal but then, as Cinzia draws men in like a dog in heat, realizes he's more interested in Cinzia. When Tom and Cynzia decide to marry, the kids hate her for it.</p>
<p>A widower, his three young kids and a bombshell nanny get to know each other better when circumstances have them living together aboard a badly neglected houseboat.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Widowed lawyer Cary Grant hires Sophia Loren to take care of his three kids and moves them all onto a houseboat. He believes Sophia to be a maid but, in fact, she's the daughter of a famous Italian conductor. Comedy and romance ensues. Cary does well with a character that's not really likable at first. He has great chemistry with Sophia, who pretty much owns the picture. She's sexy, funny, and charming. The three kids are played by Paul Peterson (of Donna Reed Show fame), Charles Herbert (13 Ghosts, among others), and Mimi Gibson (this is probably her best role). They're all good, particularly Herbert. Love his scenes with Sophia. Harry Guardino is a treat as the guy who sells Cary the houseboat after destroying their other house. Cary's then-wife Betsy Drake was originally set to star. Their marriage was on the rocks at the time, and he was having an affair with Sophia, so she wound up with the part. It worked out best for us as it would have been a far different movie with Drake, who had a pretty bland screen presence. It's a pleasant, enjoyable mix of romantic and family comedy. Nothing unpredictable or deep but good fun.</p>
