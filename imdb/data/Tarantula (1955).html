<h1>Tarantula (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Arizona desert, Professor Gerald Deemer is experimenting with growth hormones in the hopes of finding a way to increase the world's food supply. His partner in the project was recently found dead in the desert, suffering from a disease that normally takes years to advance but, in his case, seems to have afflicted him in only a few days. The local doctor, Matt Hastings, is puzzled by the strange case and, with Deemer's recently arrived (and very pretty) assistant, Stephanie Clayton, tries to figure out what is going on. When cattle remains are found in the countryside, evidence points to a giant tarantula as the culprit.</p>
<p>In Desert Rock, Arizona, a disfigured man, found dead from advanced acromegalia, is identified by Professor Gerald Deemer as his assistant and friend Dr. Eric Jacobs. Country doctor Matt Hastings, puzzled by the unusual aggressiveness of the disease, decides to investigate further. Professor Deemer omits that Dr. Eric Jacobs and Dr. Paul Lund were researching alongside him on a nutrient to increase the world's food supply, whereby both were affected by the experiment. Soon Paul Lund, who has in addition gone mad, attacks Dr. Deemer and, in dooming him to the same fate, causes the laboratory to catch fire and inadvertently affords an enlarged tarantula to escape. Meanwhile, grad student Stephanie "Steve" Clayton arrives in town to work with Dr. Jacobs, a gorgeous woman whom Dr. Hastings gladly drives to the remote Deemer house. Hired by Deemer, she finds he is sick. Elsewhere, completely stripped cattle bones are found at a farm. Hastings collects puddled material and flies to a laboratory where it's officially confirmed as tarantula venom (which one scientist disbelieves any one tarantula could ever produce in such quantity). The doctor returns to Desert Rock, sure of its connection to Prof. Deemer's experiments and of its monumental threat to the locals, which may be too late to prevent.</p>
<p>Professor Gerald Deemer has been working on a special nutrient to help ease a predicted food shortage that is expected to come with the increase in human population. His experiments have been moderately successful, but there have been some failures as well. One day while away, his two colleagues inject themselves with the nutrient with disastrous results and die a few days later. One, however, goes mad and injects Deemer with the formula. During their struggle, a giant tarantula (also injected with the formula) escapes its cage, grows ever larger, and starts attacking cattle and horses - as well as men.</p>
<p>When a tarantula which has been injected with a special nutrient formula escapes from a scientist's laboratory, it grows into a 100-foot beast that menaces the Arizona countryside.</p>
<p>A spider escapes from an isolated desert laboratory experimenting in giantism and grows to tremendous size as it wreaks havoc on the local inhabitants.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a top-of-the-line Sci-Fi thriller from the studio that did 'em best in the 1950s - Universal-International. Produced by William Alland (who also produced "Creature From the Black Lagoon" and "It Came From Outer Space", and directed by Jack Arnold (who directed those films) it has an intelligent script and good acting all the way around. Arnold does a great job of building suspense as he cleverly keeps the titular monster mostly off-screen for the first 2/3 of the film until it's simply too big to hide. And then --- watch out, folks! As in many another sci-fi story, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if there's a villain of the piece, it's the Nuclear Age - the spider of the title is merely doing it's natural thing: searching for food. Except that, thanks to Leo G. Carroll's well-meaning experiments (to increase the world's supply of food), this is one BIG spider with an equally BIG appetite! Universal's special effects department just about out-did themselves here - the matte work is almost flawless (check out Leo G. Carroll's house after the spider's visit), and the make-up department did excellent work as well. This is one of the best of it's kind, and great fun on a rainy Saturday afternoon.</p>
