<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I would agree with Robert Duvall as this being one of his favorite films he made. Any thinking person with enough patience should love this film. The movie concerns a simple, probably illiterate Mississippi dirt farmer who is hired as an overseer of a saw mill during the winter season and finds an abandoned pregnant woman whom he eventually falls in love with. The film shows the turn of the century south in a very straightforward and unglamorous fashion and very well captures the mood and feel of a very lonely rural community. The accents and natural performances are just perfect for the setting it's in. It has the feel of many Horton Foote films such as The Trip To Bountiful, Convicts, etc. Robert Duvall does great with his slow-drawling inarticulate accent. I would rate this as Duvall's greatest film along Lonesome Dove and The Apostle.</p>
