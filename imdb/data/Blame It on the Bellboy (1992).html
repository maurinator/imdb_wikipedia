<h1>Blame It on the Bellboy (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Messrs Lawton (a hit-man), Horton (expecting some middle-aged dating agency nooky) and Orton (checking out properties for his boss) converge on the Hotel Gabriella in Venice. Linguistic mix-ups by the staff mean each of the trio get wrong instructions for the next day. So Horton meets up with puzzled estate agent Caroline to see what she's offering, Orton attempts to make a gang of hoods an offer they can't refuse on their villa, while Lawton sets off to rub out a lonely-hearts lady from Huddersfield.</p>
<p>Mike Lawton, Maurice Horton, and Melvin Orton are three men who come to Venice. One of them is a hit man sent to take out a mobster. Another is a lech looking for a little action with a woman he never met, whom he was set up with. And one of them was sent by his employer to inspect a property his boss wants to buy. All three men stay at the same hotel. But when the bellboy gets their names mixed up and gives info meant for someone else. So one of them meets a Realtor who will whatever she has to, to close the sale. And another follows a woman looking for romance. And another goes to the home of the mobster who thinks he's sent there to kill him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've just read about 5 reviews panning this movie, one went so far as to call it the worst movie ever. What? I guess maybe it was too fast for them, they only like snuff films, or their diploma from film school stipulated that they can only find enjoyment in movies of over 3 hours that explain, through obscure symbolism, the whole mystery of human existence. Whatever, they have lost or maybe never had the ability to enjoy entertainment for entertaining only, no deep characters, no profound message, just slapstick. Someone complained about no "character development" fer chrissake! What? You needed to know what made Brown a hit-man, What school Moore went to? I guess my last thought would be; what then possessed them to watch this movie and write a review? Just to show how "culturny" they are compared to all of the simpletons who enjoyed the film? Get over your snooty selves! It's a funny film that you don't have to think about, just titter for 80+ minutes, then forget it and go on with your life.</p>
