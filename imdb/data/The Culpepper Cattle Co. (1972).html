<h1>The Culpepper Cattle Co. (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Teenager Ben Mockridge feels life in a Wild West farm town has nothing better to offer than horse-cart racing with other hicks, so he naively begs cattle company owner Frank Culpepper to engage him as the youngest cowboy for a long cattle trail to a fort. His mother barely notices. Ben doesn't even seem to get it when he's told to report as 'little Mary' to the old cook, whose words, "Cowboy is something you do only if you have nothing better." gradually become clear. Instead of an exciting heroic macho life, it's endless hard work, dumb chores and embarrassment, even getting literally caught with his pants down, robbed of his horse, and witnessing unpunished crimes...</p>
<p>Young farmboy who always wanted to be a cowhand talks a tough trail boss into hiring him on a cattle drive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is easily one of the best westerns made. So overlooked and no real good reason why. It was so well done and the cast is some of the best western actors you can get!!!! Everybody connected with the making of this film did an outstanding job and Billy Green Bush was the stand out performance as the trail boss. The realism was unmistakeable! A very well done film and highly reccomended to all. This film MUST be released onto DVD soon!</p>
