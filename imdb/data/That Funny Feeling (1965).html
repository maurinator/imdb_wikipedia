<h1>That Funny Feeling (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joan Howell, a young and pretty maid-for-hire, meets and begins dating wealthy New York City businessman Tom Milford. Embarrassed about bringing him back to her tiny apartment that she shares with her roommate Audrey, Joan brings Tom over to a fancy apartment that she cleans on a daily basis not knowing that it's his place. Tom plays along with the charade despite not knowing who Joan really is, while she tries to tidy up Tom's place not knowing who he really is.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An unexciting turn from Sandra Dee as a maid who pretends that she lives in her bosses apartment, with predictable results. Bobby Darin is usually uninspiring, and his performance is predictable. Donald O'Connor is the only bright spot in this otherwise unimaginative, makeshift romantic comedy. A routine time-waster.</p>
