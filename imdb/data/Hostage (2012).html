<h1>Hostage (2012)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Taken by force ... held against their will. In this hour - hostages, thrust into terrifying life and death situations: a dramatic attempt by US Special Forces to save an American hostage in Iraq; an eight-hour standoff ends in a burst of gunfire; children trapped inside a bus, and forced on a chase through the streets of Miami by a desperate man; and fifty-two Americans held captive for more than a year.</p>
