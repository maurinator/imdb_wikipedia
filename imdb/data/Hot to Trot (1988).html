<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wish I still had this movie, I sold it but had watched it a lot back in the day. It has everything a good old Jerry Lewis movie would have. Bobcat's "character" is a combination of his old crazy Police Academy self, and a new sort of guy that wants to fit in and make it in society. There's a lot of great characters in this. Although it's predictable, the execution makes it worth the ride every time. It's not "viral" or anything. It's a hidden gem for people who appreciate the classics but also like it when things just get outright silly. The unexplained things that get written in to this kind of comedy make it what it is. This isn't going to impress any snobs who have never farted or talked in a funny voice. But it doesn't rely on toilet humor either. It's just right.</p>
