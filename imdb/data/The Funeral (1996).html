<h1>The Funeral (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>New York City, the 1930s. A powerful crime family is caught in a lethal crossfire between union organizers and brutal corporate bosses. Against this turbulent backdrop, the family's three street-hardened brothers and the women they love are about to be plunged into a deadly confrontation with their enemies, with each other, and with their own dark heritage of violence, madness and murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found this an interesting movie, admittedly a bit slow at points, but if you're out for another "crime gone wrong" or "gangster crime war" film, forget it.  Several reviews complain about a lack of action.  It's not an action film.  Several reviews complain about a lack of plot.  It's more an examination of characters than a story.  The movie would have been much better had I been able to hear more of it.  The sound editing is truly abysmal.  People's shoes make more noise than their raised voices do.  I actually stopped and rewound a few times to try and catch what people said.  It's not the fault of the actors.  It's simply a bad mix job.7/10</p>
