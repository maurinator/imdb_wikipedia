<h1>Fright (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young babysitter Amanda arrives at the Lloyd residence to spend the evening looking after their young son. Soon after the Lloyds leave, a series of frightening occurrences in the gloomy old house have Amanda's nerves on edge. The real terror begins, however, when the child's biological father appears after recently escaping from a nearby mental institution.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Amanda(Susan George),a young babysitter is called to watch the child at an isolated British manor.The child's mother,Helen(Honor Blackman),has had her husband committed after he tried to murder her and the child.Helen's psycho husband(excellent Ian Bannen)returns home and terrorizes young Amanda while Helen and her new boyfriend are out on the town.The film is pretty creepy-there are numerous false scares which work pretty well.The most surprising is the fact that "Fright" is pretty similar to "Halloween"-for example both movies take place mostly at night with a babysitter in peril.There is no gore and nudity at all,but like I said before,there are some effective scares throughout the film.I agree that "Fright" is pretty boring at times,but if you are a fan of British horror cinema give this one a look!</p>
