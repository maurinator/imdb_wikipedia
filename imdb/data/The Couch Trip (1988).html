<h1>The Couch Trip (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The escaped delinquent John W. Burns, Jr. replaces Dr. Maitlin on a radio show, saying he's the psychiatrist Lawrence Baird. His tactless radio show is a hit, and he becomes very popular. But then Dr. Maitlin meets the real Dr. Lawrence Baird at a congress in London...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wasn't expecting much from this movie to be honest, it was on late night television and only stayed to watch it because I couldn't sleep, but I found it funny, original and it has a great cast. This is one of those lost eighties comedies which more people should see. Dan Aykroyd is especially brilliant giving his usual mad perfomance! See it if you can...9 out of 10</p>
