<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To truly understand and appreciate "Return to OZ", you've got to know two things.First off, this is NOT a follow-up to the classic MGM movie.  This can't be emphasized enough.  It is actually a synthesis of the first five or so sequels to the BOOK.  (This isn't a dig at the movie, mind you.  If you don't like it on some level or other, you can't be human.  It's just that the movie was based on the book in the respect that the characters in the movie had the same names as the characters in the book.)Secondly, L. Frank Baum's original, printed-page OZ is, quite possibly, the most messed up imaginary universe ever created.  There's a land of beings who throw their own heads at you as weapons.  There's a land of sentient vegetables who raise *people* in their gardens (think "Motel Hell" and you've got the idea).  To top it all off, it turns out that Dorothy's buddies are really good at killing things; in particular the dear, heartless Tin Man who bloodies up his hatchet with unsettling apathy.What I'm trying to get at here is that "Return to OZ" is an OZ movie that is much more faithful to the books.  Much more "THIS is how long you have to be alive!" than "We represent the Lullaby League".  I think it goes without saying that you'd be legally insane to show it to little kids, but fantasy fans, OZ enthusiasts, and fans of cult movies should hunt it down as soon as possible.By the way, please note that the old-school herky-jerky puppets and claymation monsters in this movie are scary as all get out.  Compare this to the awful remake of "the Haunting" with it's stupid cartoonish CGI creatures (and this isn't a dig at computer animation, but since the technique is inheritely realist, it's not scary).  There is a lesson here.</p>
