<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am becoming a huge fan of Steve Martin's, after all we have the same birthday ;), no, I'm having fun, but I love his movies. My mom is also a huge fan and has a lot of Steve Martin movies, the next on my list of flicks to watch was Leap of Faith. She said it was an alright film, but it was always worth a watch. So I finally sat down tonite and watched it and over all, I'd say that this was a nice and honest film to watch that can touch anyone's heart.Jonas is a con man going from town to town claiming he is a miracle preacher, Jane, his sidekick, just finds out information about the town and Jonas acts like he knows everything by miracle. Of course he and his team just take the money and run after a couple days. But when Jonas realizes the town's good nature, he starts to feel bad and falls for a waitress with a crippled brother. But things start to happen when the town's faith grows stronger and miracles really do happen.I would recommend Leap of Faith for an afternoon of nothing to do, I think that it is an under rated cute little movie that could make you have a leap of faith for anything. Steve Martin isn't really funny in this film, but I think Leap of Faith actually showed his dramatic talents pretty well, he's awesome.6/10</p>
