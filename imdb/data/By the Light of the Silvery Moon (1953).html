<h1>By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The trials and tribulations of the Winfield family in small town Indiana as Marjorie Winfield's boyfriend, William Sherman, returns from the Army after W.W.I. Bill & Marjorie's on-again, off-again provide the backdrop for other family issues, primarily brought on by little brother Wesley's overactive imagination and tall tales.</p>
<p>It's 1918 in Milburn, Indiana. The war has just ended which means that twenty year old Bill Sherman will soon be coming home, much to the delight of tomboyish eighteen year old Margie Winfield as it also means that the two can be married. Margie's banker father George Winfield, who had an initial dislike for Bill, now likes Bill and wants to see the two get married. Bill, who feels he has matured during his time in the war, now has other ideas as he wants to build a nest egg to support Margie better before getting married. Although Margie agrees, she doesn't agree that she too shouldn't get a job to help build that nest egg, this difference which may threaten their engagement altogether, especially with the officious Chester Finley waiting in the wings for Margie's hand. Margie's parent's marriage may also be in trouble as Margie, her younger precocious brother Wesley and their family housekeeper Stella find what they believe is a love letter written by George to a visiting French actress, Renee LaRue. The letter causes some hard feelings within the household, but Margie, Wesley and Stella do whatever they can to maintain the family unit in the lead-up to to their parent's twentieth wedding anniversary. Her parent's supposed problems also make Margie think twice about getting married herself.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For about the millionth time and it's right up there with The Sound of Music. I love Doris and I love Gordon. There is such a chemistry between them that shines through on the screen it is remarkable. I really can't decide which is the better of the two, By the light of the silvery moon or On moonlight bay. Sheer brilliance.</p>
