<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A true classic for the hopelessly romantic. An ageless epic of romance and with sprinkles of suspense and agony of a woman scorned by one and yet passionate and protective of another who she had betrayed unknowingly. This is perhaps Asha Parekh's last starring role and she converges all of her emotions and essence into it portraying a woman living a lie. Rajesh Khanna plays true the man scorned by a love he has never seen and falls again for a maiden whom he isn't likely to get either. The songs alone channel the story through its pathway and the climax well - is not unlike so many other Hindi movies around. Prem Chopra a true Hindi villain and Bindu the budding vamp is just the right touch for any ole Hindi Classic.</p>
