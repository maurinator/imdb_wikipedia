<h1>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Radio DJ Vanita 'Stretch' Brock's open request night is plagued by the annoying phone pranking of two road tripping, party-hard, hoodlums, but things take a disturbing turn when the hoodlums meet their demise at the hands of familiar chainsaw wielding maniacs. With the entire gruesome ordeal recorded on tape, Stretch seeks out the help of a former Texas Marshall who's on a personal quest of vengeance against this family of cannibals. While at first he turns her down, he eventually decides to use her tape to his advantage, asking her to air it during her request block- effectively baiting the cannibals to the radio station where he'll personally deal with them.</p>
<p>A radio host is victimized by the cannibal family as a former Texas Marshall hunts them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tobe Hooper comes back to direct a sequel that follows the events of the initial Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. Although we see Leatherface and Jim Seidow's role as "The Cook" return in the storyline, it was actually the newcomers characters who were the most interesting. If it wasn't for the star-power of Dennis Hopper and the desirableness of Caroline Williams, this sequel would have totally stunk in my opinion. The writing was really awful, especially hack in the beginning car chase and cook-off. Usually, a horror film is either great in the beginning and fades off or starts slow with a great ending. With TCM II, it's a first for me to say that a few scenes in the middle of the film were the most entertaining.The film lost a lot of grittiness and distinguishing characteristics that the predecessor possessed. It didn't tie itself well to its roots and I felt this was a really rushed attempt that could have been a lot better. Part 2 did enough though to hold my interest and I found myself not being too critical of the ending scenes even though it's pretty bad. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, or the franchise itself, is perhaps not really my cup of tea but as a horror fan I understand it's importance and still think it's a must watch.</p>
