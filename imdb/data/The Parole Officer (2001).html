<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was looking forward to this film so much that I was was waiting outside the cinema an hour before it opened, and I have to say I wasn't the slightest bit disappointed. I expected nothing less than Steve Coogan's genius, and I think that was what the audience got-Steve Coogan's genius. Although many wouldn't agree I feel this film is very Cooganesque, how couldn't it be? It was written by the main man and Henry Normal, as most Steve Coogan productions are. The cast were great, except for maybe one bad choice, and the acting was great. So much effort was put into this, especially by Steve Coogan, and it paid off as they all created a British masterpiece! Keep up the good work Steve!</p>
