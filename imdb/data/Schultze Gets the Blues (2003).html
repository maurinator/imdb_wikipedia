<h1>Schultze Gets the Blues (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Schultze is a retired lignite miner living in an East German village and a passionate Polka musician on his accordion. One night he listens to a Zydeco tune in the radio, which changes his taste of music radically. Notwithstanding his complete ignorance of the English language he starts a trip into the heart of the Zydeco; to Louisana.</p>
<p>Schultze is an accordion player and newly without work. When the local music club celebrates its 50th anniversary, his taste of music changes unexpectedly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In a gray-skied German mining town, three men are given early retirement. One of them, Schultze, is a very large and almost silent man of about 50. He lives alone. His whole life revolves around his two best friends (the other guys retired with him) and his local lodge hall where he entertains on the accordion as his father did before him. Retirement is a bore. Then, one night as he is going to turn off his radio, a tune comes on, a song from the southern United States, a mixture of jazz and folk. Schultze likes it. I wouldn't dream of telling you what happens from here on, except to say that a new world opens up for him and he has some extraordinary adventures seeking out this new music that has moved him so much. Some other critics, both professional and not, have described the film by first time director Schorr as slow-moving and even boring. I found it to be neither. It is infused with a great warmth and love for humanity and is told with sly humor. Loved it.</p>
