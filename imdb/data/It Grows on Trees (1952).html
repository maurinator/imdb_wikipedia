<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I still think back to this film and how delightful it was. A common American housewife (Dunne) finds two trees that grow money in a yard sale, I believe my brother and sister said. I erroneously believed the woman was Gracie Allen. Later I would learn it was Dunne. Wonderful what became of the money, Dunne's husband, the nosy neighbor, everything. I wish I remembered Richard Crenna in this, but I do remember the ending very well; what became of the money trees and then the overall ending of the film.I had read once that Dunne regretted making this movie and it is surprising to see it was her final film as well. She may not have liked it, but we sure did.</p>
