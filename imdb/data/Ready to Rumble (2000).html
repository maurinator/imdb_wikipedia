<h1>Ready to Rumble (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two dimwit sewage workers watch their hero, WCW wrestler Jimmy King, get screwed out of the World title by wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and evil WCW owner Titus Sinclair. They embark on a quest to help their hero win his title - and honor - back. Features cameos by lots of WCW wrestlers.</p>
<p>Gordie Boggs and Sean Dawkins are two dumb hardcore wrestling fans who worship WCW's World Champion, Jimmy King. When they attend an episode of WCW Nitro to see King defend the title from Diamond Dallas Page, they witness him losing in a dishonest effort and being fired by the president, Titus Sinclair. After their truck breaks down on their way home, the guys figure it must be a test to find King and avenge his unfair loss and firing. They find him and persuade him to go back to WCW and get the title back. King shows up on Nitro with Gordie and Sean, and King pins Page after all hell breaks loose. This causes Sinclair to strike up a deal: if King defeats Page at the next pay-per-view, he gets his title back plus $1 million; if he loses, he is never allowed back in WCW. So Gordie and Sean take King back to basics, and rebuild him to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship once and for all.</p>
<p>Two slacker wrestling fans are devastated by the ousting of their favorite character by an unscrupulous promoter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sad this movie did kill WCW forever, this wrestling federation went down even further if it would have stick to its wrestling only (the "King" storyline with DDP and the evil manager Sinclair), but instead, went into too much vulgarity such as raw sewage and toilet bowl humour, which was not necessary at all. I would have went another direction rather than putting too much of feces jokes.Martin Landau is great as a former wrestler turned teacher. And the wrestling storyline is just like what we see on TV.Bottom line: should have stick to wrestling only, as it is the only entertaining portion here...</p>
