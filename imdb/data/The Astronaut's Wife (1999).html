<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just watched this movie which is 14 years old and I've never heard of it maybe because of the 5.1 score on IMDb. I have never EVER been more in disagreement with this site. This is not a 5/10 rated movie should be much closer to 7/10 don't know what people are thinking to be honest. The actors in it should alone be worth a 7. and i must say they did not disappoint at all so i don't know why people vote it 5. that was all i had to say but have to write 10 lines. Well Worth a watch if u haven't allrdy. im just filling out space now. gogo watch it. very hard to write 10 lines about something i could write in 1 line critics are WRONG! this is at least 7/10 in my opinion i have watched movies with 8+ that was worse then this so.</p>
