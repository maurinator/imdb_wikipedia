<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tom Cruise what a performance , I think he touched all four bases with this one,, however Bryan Brown steals the show for me,, add in Gina Gershon and Elisabeth Shue, what's not to like,, a college student trying to make money has trouble finding a job,, so he finds a bar to work at part-time while he goes to school,, their he meets an older gentleman who gives him a chance to be the bartender, he learns all the tricks of the trade and things seem to be looking up for our main character, he plans on marrying his sweetheart but he has trouble managing his relationship,, the bar, and going to school,, things start going a little south for our mentor as well, when he get's involved with a woman that he really shouldn't, this movie is well packed with some action,, some lighthearted moments, a lot of serious moments,, and tons of laughter,, this is one of tom cruise's better earlier efforts I felt,, what an enjoyable movie to watch,</p>
