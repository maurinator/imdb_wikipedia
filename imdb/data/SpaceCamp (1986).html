Then they're launched by mistake ...</p>
<p>The young attendees of a space camp find themselves in space for real when their shuttle is accidently launched into orbit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ok, I first saw this little gem when I was around 9 years old. Back then I thought this film was cool. The other day, they played this movie on the SciFi Channel. I sat there thinking to myself, "This is a lot more stupid than I remember."  And It is. I read a review on here that claimed that Kate Capshaw's character is annoying. Is that it? They're all annoying, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character, Max. They're all just a bunch of whiny individuals in the need of a serious beating.  So maybe It's cause I'm older now, and more things annoy me, or this film is strictly for kids.  On a lighter note, it was good to see Larry B. Scott (Lamar from Revenge of the Nerds).</p>
