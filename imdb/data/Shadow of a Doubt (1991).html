<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hmm, so this is a remake of a Hitchcock movie?  It would be absolutely moronic to compare the two movies in any way.  There's really no point in doing so.  Each has its own identity and they have no direct relation, they don't go together.  The only thing this should be compared to is itself. And how does it stack up?  Well, Diane Ladd was good, although, that whole early 50's perfect mom in the perfect neighborhood persona really got on my nerves.  The father also annoying as he was just a spineless `yes, dear, whatever you say, dear puppet.  Mark Harmon, on the other hand, he had it goin' on.  Wow.  He played the role of psycho strangler just excellently... he had practice (as Ted Bundy!)  Margaret Welch played a little over the top but not bad in her role as Uncle Charlie's soulmate turned nemesis.  Who'll win in the end and how? That was the question.  There wasn't much mystery to this, just some dark suspense.  A perfect movie it surely wasn't.  It missed on several levels, I can't say exactly how but it left me unsatisfied at the end.  All in all it was alright... My Grade: C-</p>
