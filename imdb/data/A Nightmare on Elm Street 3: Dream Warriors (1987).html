<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Picking up where the original Nightmare left off, Nancy has grown up and become a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy. She meets a group of children at a local hospital facing Freddy Krueger, the same demon she once encountered in her sleep. One of them is Kristen, who has the power to draw other people into her dreams. Working with a male doctor assigned to the case, Nancy helps the kids realize their special abilities within the nightmare world. When Freddy captures one of her charges, she leads a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, in hopes of putting his spirit to rest once and for all.</p>

Nancy has just accepted a position as a research scientist at a pschiatric institution near the fated house on Elm Street and is working with a group of children who all share nightmares of Freddy. She discovers that one of the children (Kristen) has a special gift which may help them destroy Freddy forever.</p>
<p>Survivors of undead serial killer Freddy Krueger - who stalks his victims in their dreams - learn to take control of their own dreams in order to fight back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This part is more entertaining that the original. I always watch slasher movies only for entertainment, I don't care much about a dialogs (Psycho would be an exception, the dialogs was the best thing in it) or acting, all I want to see is some entertaining, sometimes funny looking graphic murder scenes and this movie has it. My favorite was TV room scene. I also find this movie being really creepy sometimes, what is not usual for slasher films, like that scene where Freddy made one of the kids fall from a window, the whole scene was kinda creepy. The plot was great, I liked the idea that this movie is set on mental hospital, that made this movie even more creepy.</p>
