<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A police detective tracks a serial killer who is stalking young women on a beach front after each game that a baseball pitcher wins.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The main drawcard is the exciting actor, Roy Scheider. Sadly, he can't carry such a deadweight on his own. The script was absolutely awful and the directing dreadful. The story was slow and the fight scene at the end was like a children's recital. That's not the fault of the actors as I blame that on the director. I like to know who finances these type of films. Too much money and not knowing what to do with it must be the diagnosis. On one interesting note is Karen Young. Does she remind you of Shirley MacLaine or what?</p>
