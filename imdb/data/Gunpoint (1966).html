<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Audie Murphy's western films of the 1950's were entertaining, action-filled and capitalized on his likable, resolute personality. The budgets for those '50's films were higher than his subsequent films in the 1960's. This average film has that weakness, but is still entertaining when viewed in that context.This film's mediocre budget and production values disappoint, while still showcasing those aspects of Audie Murphy's talent that always appealed to his many fans. I especially liked the casting in this one, with western favorites Royal Dano and the crusty old Edgar Buchanan.For fans of Murphy, this one is a must see...... for others, watch it in context and you will be surprised. Worth a closer look .........</p>
