<h1>Trouble Along the Way (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Struggling to retain custody of his daughter following his divorce, football coach Steve Williams finds himself embroiled in a recruiting scandal at the tiny Catholic college he is trying to bring back to football respectability.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one John Wayne movie with which I was not familiar and with which his biography barely deals.  While often stock & predictable, it is truly a heart-warming movie which nevertheless contains a rather frank expose and indictment of the "professionalism" present in college football.  When one considers that when the movie was made, college football was MUCH bigger than professional football, it is amazing that the movie is so realistic in this regard.</p>
