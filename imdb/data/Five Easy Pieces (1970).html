<h1>Five Easy Pieces (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Robert Dupea has given up his promising career as a concert pianist and is now working in oil fields. He lives together with Rayette, who's a waitress in a diner. When Robert hears from his sister that his father isn't well, he drives up to Washington to see him, taking Rayette with him. There he gets confronted with his rich, cultured family that he had left behind.</p>
<p>Bobby Eroica Dupea comes from a well-bred family of musicians, and once showed great promise as a concert pianist. By nature a restless, angry individual, Bobby left his family and his music when he could no longer endure the dull, cloistered routine of daily practice. He took to the road, wanting to "see the world," and hopefully find something or someone to quell his inner turmoil. He has settled in a small town as an oil rigger, where his life consists of going to work, arguing with his dimwitted but loving girlfriend Rayette, and bowling every night with his friend Elton. Not surprisingly, this routine begins to disgust Bobby and, fed up, he decides to travel to Puget Sound, Washington to pay his family a visit. Leaving Rayette at a nearby motel, gets on a truck leaving everything.</p>
<p>Bobby Dupea has been drifting in his life over the last several years. He currently works on an oil rig in southern California, and partakes in stereotypical working class activities during his free time. He is a brooding, irresponsible cad. When he isn't cheating on her, he treats his waitress girlfriend, Rayette Dipesto, poorly. Not the brightest light in the world, Rayette, who lives by the code of Tammy Wynette songs, continually complains to Bobby about his treatment of her, but still clings to him for dear life. This life belies the fact that Bobby grew up in a privileged life as "Robert", who, along with his two siblings, were destined for musical greatness, Robert as a classical pianist. Their parents even gave each of the three some classical musical reference as part of their given names. While his siblings followed that path, Robert rebelled against it, he who has not seen his father in three years. He hears from his classical pianist sister, Partita, that their father has suffered a couple of strokes which has rendered him semi-comatose. As such, Bobby, with Rayette tagging along much to his chagrin, decides to return to the home he grew up in - a musical compound where his father and two siblings still live - to visit with his father. This reunion, which includes seeing his siblings' current lives, provides the stepping stone for what Bobby decides to do in the next immediate phase of his life. This reunion, which includes his violinist brother Carl's mentoring of young beautiful pianist named Catherine Van Oost, makes Bobby contemplate running toward instead of running away from something for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>Bobby Dupea seems to be a regular blue collar kind of guy. He works on oil rigs and lives with his girlfriend Rayette who works as waitress in a diner. He spends a lot of his time drinking and carousing. After having little or no contact with his family for three years, he decides to pay a visit to his family home after sister Partita tells him their father is quite ill having had a stroke. Surprisingly, Bobby's family is quite well off and all seem to be accomplished musicians. Bobby himself is a classical pianist. He still finds them pompous and annoying, something that comes to the fore again during his visit.</p>
<p>A drop-out from upper-class America picks up work along the way on oil-rigs when his life isn't spent in a squalid succession of bars, motels, and other points of interest.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bob Rafelson's FIVE EASY PIECES is about inner pain and suffering that just so happens to consume people in all walks of life.  It is sometimes hard to watch and Nicholson's character "Robert" is a miserable SOB.  However, he is also a very compelling character who affects all around him.  He is lonely, he is scared, and he does not know what to do with himself.If you are looking for plot, this is not the picture for you.  The only remnants of a plot concern Nicholson's father, a distant memory of his previous prestigious lifestyle as a classical pianist, who has fallen sick. Jack decides to visit his family's estate to pay his last respects.  This sets the forum of emotional indifference and misery.  He hates his old life, which he left to become a construction worker and has taken up with a flighty waitress played brilliantly by Karen Black.  He pretends to enjoy this simple way of living, but he treats Black like the trash he considers her to be and could care less about anyone.Why should anyone see this film?  Because Jack Nicholson is one of our greatest actors and he is able to transcend what was put on paper regarding the main character and project raw power and feelings in his own, unique way.  The movie is littered with classic scenes, in particular, the chicken salad sandwich scene, one of the funniest I've ever seen.  The one I feel that stands out and symbolizes the essence of the film is where Jack plays Chopin in the piano room while Rafelson's camera does a slow 360 around the room, glancing at pictures of his life before he fled from it.  It is a perfect mixture of intensity, music, and sadness.The last scene, which ends so abruptly, makes perfect sense within this context.  It leaves us feeling empty and unfulfilled, exactly how Nicholson's character feels.  This is what makes this character piece all the more powerful.</p>
