<h1>Gloria (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mild mannered Jack Dawn has been secretly working as an accountant for the mob. He, his Puerto Rican wife Jeri, his teen-aged daughter Joan and his mother-in-law, all who were planning on going on the run, are murdered by the mob because Jack was going to inform on them to the FBI. Before they're killed, Jack and Jeri are able to send their six-year old son Phil to Jeri's friend and their neighbor, Gloria Swenson, for safe keeping. Also with Phil is the book which contains all the information Jack was going to turn over. Gloria and Phil have an antagonistic relationship, not so much for who they are but what they are, Phil a kid, and Gloria a strange white woman who hates kids. As an ex-mistress of a mobster, Gloria learns that the people that killed the Dawns are old friends of hers. As Gloria and Phil go on the run both from the mob and from the authorities (who believe she kidnapped Phil) throughout New York City, Gloria has to come up with a plan on how best to save themselves, which is not easy because of their love/hate relationship and the fact that precocious Phil has a mind of his own. That plan includes what to do with the book, but more importantly how to save Phil as the mob would still be after him regardless of the book just in case he knows something about his father's dealings. All through their ordeal, Gloria is not averse to shooting to kill, especially if those who she is trying to kill are trying to kill her and Phil first.</p>
<p>Jack Dawn and his family are eliminated by the mob, because he was their accountant and was keeping a personal copy of their records. However his six-year-old Puerto Rican son, Phil, escapes with Gloria, a neighbor who was a former girlfriend of one of the gangsters. Gloria and Phil are chased throughout New York City because Phil has a black book containing the accounts of the mob.</p>
<p>When a young boy's family is killed by the mob, their tough neighbor Gloria becomes his reluctant guardian. In possession of a book that the gangsters want, the pair go on the run in New York.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film's cinematography and musical score captures the seedy underbelly of 1970's New York City in the same way "Taxi Driver" and "The French Connection" do. Gloria takes on the mob after they murder her friend's family and seek out the little boy who Gloria helped escape his families execution and who hold's a valuable item. The unlikely pair weave through the streets of NYC until they figure out what to do. Some great Stylistic suspense throughout. Directed and written by the late John Cassavetes. Don't waste your time on Sharon Stone's remake - this is the one to see.</p>
