<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Last of the Mohicans" is a very good film that was basically ignored by everyone in 1992.  Based on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name, the movie is impressive in every way imaginable.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are best in the ensemble cast.  Michael Mann's direction has rarely been better.  4.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
