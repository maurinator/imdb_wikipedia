<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this film. Its a great movie starring Paul LeMat (John Milner in American Graffiti)and Diane Hull. The soundtrack is Great. Bobby, (LeMat) has a red hot 68 Camaro complete with body flares and mods. This car was originally built out of a 1967 Z28 and completely race prepped by Traco engineering for The Garner (actor James Garner) racing team. It was then Purchased by cine-artist for the filming of Aloha Bobby and Rose. I recently was in San Francisco when i actually saw this car parked in front of a auto parts store. I recognized the car right off. The owner came along ( a guy named Rick) and gave me a closer look. The car is in original movie condition and will be touring with actor Paul LeMat this year. I highly recommend this film to any car guy. The film is now available on DVD.</p>
