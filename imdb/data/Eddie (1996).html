<h1>Eddie (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eddie is a New York limo driver and a fanatical follower of the New York Knicks professional basketball team. The team is struggling with a mediocre record when, in mid-season, "Wild Bill" Burgess, the new owner, as a public relations gimmick, stages an 'honorary coach' contest, which Eddie wins. The fans love it, so "Wild Bill" fires the coach and hires her. She takes the bunch of overpaid prima donnas that make up the team and turns them around. But the owner hopes to move the team, now the darling of the New York fans, to St. Louis. He may OWN the team, but it BELONGS to the city and the fans!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is arguably one of Whoppi's best movies. It's also a well done movie overall. It's an unassuming comedy that focuses more on positive characters and the better aspects of humanity than on controversy and good versus evil. It's a movie that you can watch with the entire family, especially children.Whoppi's character is a woman obsessed with the New York Knicks and through a convergence of an unusual and unlikely set of circumstances, becomes the coach of the team. Her admirable ability to see good in everyone and a lack of guile makes her a leader who steers the people around her towards victory in their lives as well as on the court.There is some genuine pathos in the movie as well as some loads of human to human interactions that are heartwarming and, yes, again, positive that will leave you satisfied and feeling pretty good. It'll turn that frown upside down.</p>
