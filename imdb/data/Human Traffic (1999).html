<h1>Human Traffic (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Cardiff club scene in the 90's: five best friends deal with their relationships and their personal demons during a weekend. Jip calls himself a sexual paranoid, afraid he's impotent. Lulu, Jip's mate, doesn't find much to fancy in men. Nina hates her job at a fast food joint, and her man, Koop, who dreams of being a great hip-hop d.j., is prone to fits of un-provoked jealousy. The fifth is Moff, whose family is down on his behavior. Starting Friday afternoon, with preparations for clubbing, we follow the five from Ecstacy-induced fun through a booze-laden come-down early Saturday morning followed by the weekend's aftermath. It's breakthrough time for at least three of them.</p>
<p>Five friends spend one lost weekend in a mix of music, love and club culture.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I absolutely love this film.  Everything about it.  It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen.  The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative.  I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some.  I'm really glad I ran across this movie.  If only there were more genius' like justin out there!</p>
