<h2> Summaries </h2>

A Middle Eastern country wants the samples for their own purposes, but meanwhile, a lonely scientist combines Godzilla's genetic code with those of a rose and his own deceased daughter. The result is Biollante, an eerie plant of titanic proportions. To make matters worse, a psychic woman detects Godzilla stirring from his volcanic prison. The military sends the flying Super-X2 to stop the beast from thrashing Japan, but eventually Godzilla engages the rapidly mutating Biollante in a fight to the death.</p>
<p>After rising from his volcanic grave, Godzilla is threatened by a mutated rosebush.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Hesei Series began with Godzilla 1985. Godzilla vs Biolante is the second film of the new Hesei Series of Godzilla Films and is truly a Phenomenal Film.Godzilla is still trapped inside of the volcano. A local scientist finds some of Godzilla's cells and starts to test with them. His daughter is killed when an explosion goes off in his lab. He then starts using his daughters cells, and mixes them with some Godzilla Cells and some rose cells. This starts to create a giant plant type monster with a rose bud for a head. Godzilla breaks free from the Volcano and starts to go on a rampage. Godzilla meets up with this giant plant monster, Biolante, and sets it on fire apparently killing it. Godzilla attacks japan and further attempts to destroy him are made.The fact that this film follows up Godzilla 1985 and shows that he escapes from his volcano prison is awesome. I was always sad at the end of Godzilla 1985 so Godzilla escaping in this one set this film off on a good note for me.Godzilla looks awesome. In fact for the rest of this series he looks pretty much the same and that is good. They did away with the fangs that he had in Godzilla 1985 and gave him a much more dinosaur looking head. Godzilla gets in a lot of action and proves how destructive he is. Nothing can stop him and nothing will slow him down. This is one of the best portrayals of Godzilla in any movie he is in and he gets in a lot more action than he did in Godzilla 1985. I am not saying that Godzilla 1985 is a bad film it is just that this film is much better.Godzilla gets an opponent for the first time in the Hesei Series. Biolante is his foe, a truly unique monster. First it shows up as a giant Rose headed monster with Venus Fly trap tentacles. This form does not do anything for me, it looks like a giant rose and that is kind of odd. Godzilla destroys this form pretty easy. Biolante then turns into another form, a much more impressive looking form. In this form Biolante gets a giant crocodile type head and a huge body covered with sharp spines and is able to shoot a glowing acid ray. In this form Biolante towers over Godzilla and is the largest monster that Godzilla has fought in a film. In this form Biolante is a very dangerous foe and very physically imposing. One of the most memorable of all of Godzilla's enemies.Also great in this film is the Super X 2, another vehicle designed to combat Godzilla. It is cool how it seems in each film a new vehicle is set up to fight Godzilla but none seem to work. Great scenes of Godzilla against the military in this film.Also great in this film is how they brought back the original Godzilla march song. The films that have this soundtrack just seem to be better than the ones that do not.So this is a phenomenal film, one of the best. Great special effects, a great foe for Godzilla, and awesome music. A must see.</p>
