<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I, too, was in this bomb; my mother and I were the only people in the theater as it completed its short run here!  What a shame that my brief career in Hollywood was in such a poor example of Michael Rithchie's work.  But, just having heard of Ritchie's death a couple of weeks ago, I got to thinking how it was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life, just being an extra in one of his movies.  Michael Ritchie was not only a talented director, but I can attest to the fact that he was a genuinely fine person as well.  I feel immense sadness knowing that he is no longer with us.Peter</p>
