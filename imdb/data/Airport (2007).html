<h1>Airport (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chippy (Laurel) thinks she is just another average Filipina girl living an average life in America. But things become extraordinary for her when she meets Joseph (Eigenmann), another young Filipino transplanted to America. Soon, Chippy and Jospeh learn that they left the Philippines on the same day, and even took the same plane from the Philippines to go to America. They owned the same sweatshirt. Their homes in the Philippines were similar. They even lived in the same town for a time, where Joseph was a regular customer in Chippy's grandmother's store. And yet they never met before. Are these near-misses a sign that they are each other's destiny?</p>
