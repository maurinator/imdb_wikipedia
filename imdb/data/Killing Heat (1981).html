<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 1960, "Karen Black stars as a successful career woman based in South Africa. She falls in love (it says here) with a bush farmer and must give up the relative comfort of city life. The core of the film is her effort to assimilate herself into her forbidding new environment," according to the DVD sleeve description. Ms. Black does not adapt well to the African humidity. She transfers herself into a Southern belle and slowly expires. Since we see her death in the opening, before the flashback, no surprise. Slow. Very.*** Killing Heat (9/18/81) Michael Raeburn ~ Karen Black, John Thaw, John Kani, John Moulder-Brown</p>
