<h1>Come Back, Charleston Blue (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sequel to Cotton comes to Harlem. Another bad influence is hitting Harlem and Gravedigger and Coffin Ed are the two cops who will stop it. Charleston Blue was a prohibition era black gangster, dead 4 decades. When he seems to have reappeared, once again slitting throats with his Blue straight edge razors, the two cops begin a complicated search for some answers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen and own this movie and think it's a "classic". I absolutely love the film from the actors, story and especially the soundtrack to it.For anyone that may have influence or knows someone who does in regards to this film, I would ask or even implore you to make this film available on DVD!!! I have been waiting for years for this to become available on DVD and it hasn't up to this point. I tell you that I will be one of the first in line to get it. Willie Dynamite was just released a few months ago and it was made, roughly, sometime after Charelston Blue I believe. Please bring it out on DVD. VHS is cool, but...Anyway, love the movie, and would definitely recommend it to anyone to enjoy.BTW, was/is there a soundtrack available as well? That's probably on a tape and not a CD huh? LOL!!! Please respond.</p>
