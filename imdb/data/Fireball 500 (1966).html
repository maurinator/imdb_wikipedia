<h1>Fireball 500 (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stock car racer Dave Owens plays into the hands of whiskey runners by agreeing to drive in a cross-country road race. He is assisted by Jane Harris and Sonny Leander Fox. Soon Dave and Sonny begin a friendly rivalry for Jane. Track action filmed at the Ascot and Saugus Raceways near Los Angeles, local color shot in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like the way the movie portrayed the moonshiners, and the way they influenced the early stock car racers. The musical theme was the wave of the era. This movie had a lot of the same themes as some of the Elvis movies.</p>
