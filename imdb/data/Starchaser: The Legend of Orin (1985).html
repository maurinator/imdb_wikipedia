<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember seeing this film years ago when i was younger and definitely have a memory of renting it out more than once from the video shop. For the past couple of years i've been searching around second hand video shops (in vain none the less)trying to find a copy. Looking back on it the comparisons between it and star wars are incredible; a diamond smuggler with an amazing ship (Han Solo perhaps), a young boy escaping from a very crap life to fight an evil bad guy with the use of his newly found sword (Luke and his light saber?). However despite this, it really was an enjoyable film and i'll spend another 4 years looking for it.</p>
