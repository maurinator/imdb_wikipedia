<h1>The Hanoi Hilton (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A drama focusing on the suffering, torture, and brutal treatment the American P.O.W.s had to deal with daily while in North Vietnam's Hoa Lo Prison, the most infamous P.O.W. camp in Hanoi. The film focuses on the resistance the prisoners gave to their captors and the strong bonds formed by the Americans during their captivity.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was not good, the only thing that made it even remotely realistic was the torture. I have read every book on Vietnam POW's that I can possibly get my hands on and believe me the way that the American and Vietnamese were portrayed in this movie is far from accurate. Don't get me wrong, the POW's area heroes, and they did the best they could but the didn't walk by each other saluting, or flaunt their chain of command to the North, more accurately they were broken men, many stories tell of the fear they felt hearing the guards keys tingle, there is one moment were a prisoner is being taken out to "interrogation" and he jumps off the bed saying "my turn" like it is some luxury trip. I have no problem with a movie portraying these men as resilient, and brave, but lets stop the B/s propaganda and show how they were shells of the men they once were. It wasn't until the 70's that some of them even saw the face of another man in the very next cell! Its a disgrace to make this movie like they were on vacation, and the Guards weren't bumbling idiots as portrayed in the film. Read a book to get the true story's, and if you must watch a movie watch a documentary. This is just junk.</p>
