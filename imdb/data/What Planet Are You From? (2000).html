<h1>What Planet Are You From? (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A highly-evolved planet, whose denizens feel no emotion and reproduce by cloning, plans to take over Earth from the inside by sending an operative, fashioned with a humming, mechanical penis, to impregnate an earthling and stay until the birth. The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie.  I think it is better on video because at home you can laugh out loud and not offend anyone. All the actors had great lines through out the movie.  But a new one to watch for is Rebecca the stewardess (Judy Greer).   Linda Fiorentino was outstanding, as usual, to bad her part wasn't larger.All is all a lot of fun. Enjoy!!!!</p>
