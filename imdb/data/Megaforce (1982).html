<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is my absolute favourite movie to watch to make fun of with friends. Have you ever seen an MST3K film? This movie would make great fodder. The stunts are cheesy, including possibly the worst blue screen ever, the acting is bad, the plot is laughable ... everything is so bad that it flips into being awesome. I highly recommend this movie if you are in the mood to laugh AT a movie, not WITH it. Watching it by yourself is not really recommended. I had to rate it highly, even though it's not actually a "good" movie because I do think people will enjoy watching it.</p>
