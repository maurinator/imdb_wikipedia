<h1>Broken Vessels (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young Pennsylvania man moves to Los Angeles to begin work for an ambulance service. There he is teamed with a supremely confident vet who seemingly has gone through a large number of partners. Initially the novice is awed by the more experienced man's capabilities to deal with the high pressure situations they encounter. However, gradually he discovers that all is not as it seems. While the vet is ice on the surface, he actually gets through the ordeals by heavy drug use and avoids commitments. Soon the younger man finds himself pulled into the same world and has to decide what direction he wants to take.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I came out of Broken Vessels feeling like I was 19 again, like nothing mattered except the next rush.  The passing cars with their people going home from work, and the rest of the pedestrian surroundings, meant nothing to me.  Which is very similar to the two main characters in this movie. This film is a raw, intense trip, shot all over the gritty side of L.A.  I grew up here, and the film is true to the city, at least this perspective of it.  The major flaw in Broken Vessels is that there was no universal theme, no message it delivered.  The movie didn't seem to be *about* anything other than its own story.  But the visual and emotional experience I got while viewing the film, in large part due to excellent directing by Scott Ziehl and acting by Todd Field, was well worth the price of admission.</p>
