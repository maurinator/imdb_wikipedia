<h1>The Man Who Loved Redheads (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The honourable Mark St. Neots is playing with some 'chums' when he meets and is bowled over by Sylvia. As he grows older he retains his image of this beautiful young girl with the red hair. Through a chance meeting, he can pursue his career in the diplomatic corps as well as the young ladies he meets. A charming comedy with a sting in the tail.</p>
<p>When just a young boy, Lord Binfield briefly met and fell in love with redheaded-teenager Sylvia. He never forgot her face despite having gotten married and raised a family as well as having assumed his title and a position with the foreign office. One day on the street he meets a young woman who so resembles Sylvia that he asks her to dinner, posing as a bachelor and borrowing the use of the apartment of his friend, Oscar, and also the use of Oscar's man-servant Williams. He likes the excitement and decides to lead a double life so he can dabble-and-dilly with the opposite sex at will. Over the years, all of his dabbling-and-dilling are with women who resemble Sylvia. At one of his parties, his son Dennis shows up but Binfield persuades him to keep his secret. He and Oscar grow old but still go for an occasional fling, the latest being to take two models to the opening night of a show in which Dennis appears. He is startled to find his wife, Caroline, present and in the know about his young girlfriends and also his other escapades through the years. He is overwhelmed by her loyalty and affection and resolves to stray no more. He doesn't even recognize childhood-love Sylvia standing nearby, for she, too, has grown old.</p>
<p>A young lad briefly and innocently meets a red-headed girl and never forgets. Though he becomes happily married he finds such a face framed in red hair continues to fascinate him whenever he encounters it. He even goes so far as to set up a second, secret, life and home to pursue his ideal.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a film based upon Terence Rattigan's play WHO IS SYLVIA, which in turn takes its title from both the original poem by William Shakespeare and its setting to music as a song by Schubert (a song with which my grandfather, a baritone, won much admiration). Rattigan also wrote the screenplay. This is definitely not one of Rattigan's happier moments. The film is ridiculously dated and corny, bordering on a travesty. The story is a simple one: the 'hero' played by John Justin fell in love at first sight at the age of 14 with a girl named Sylvia who had red hair and blue eyes, but he then lost contact with her. For the rest of his life he cheated on his wife and had a mews house in London for trysts with a succession of redheads who reminded him of Sylvia. Pretty silly, really. Harry Andrews plays a butler, Roland Culver has a jolly time playing a pal of Justin's who does the same sort of thing, though not with redheads, Denholm Elliott plays an earnest young son of the older Justin, and Kenneth More does a lively job of satirical narration (we do not see him). Gladys Cooper comes in towards the end with her usual assured style. It is Moira Shearer, seven years on from THE RED SHOES (1948), who plays all the redheads in succession, culminating in one who is a Russian ballet dancer named Olga. As Olga, we watch a great deal of Shearer dancing SLEEPING BEAUTY. Indeed, so much does the camera dwell on Shearer as a dancer, that one nearly forgets the film entirely. (By the way, the set and costume designs for that ballet production are simply appalling, quite a disaster.) This was the last feature film directed by Harold French, who by the way lived to be 100 and died in 1997. He made the excellent UNPUBLISHED STORY thirteen years earlier (1942, see my review). It is a pity that this film is based entirely upon wholly obsolete social codes of a bygone era, that its comedy is tepid, and that it is just not very good.</p>
