<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rich, eccentric T.J. Banner adopts a feral cat who becomes an affectionate pet. Then T.J. dies, leaving to Rhubarb most of his money and a pro baseball team, the Brooklyn Loons. When the team protests, publicist Eric Yeager convinces them Rhubarb is good luck. But Eric's fianc√©e Polly seems to be allergic to cats, and the team's success may mean new hazards for Rhubarb.</p>
<p>Screwball-noir in which curmudgeonly-but-lovable tycoon (T.J. Banner) dies and leaves his fortune, including a Brooklyn baseball franchise, to his lovable-but-curmudgeonly cat (Rhubarb), setting into motion plot involving thwarted romance, court battles, baseball heroics and gangsters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A true classic especially for those lovers of furry little beasts and baseball.  Gene Lockhart is delightful as T.J. Banner, owner of a baseball team that is not very good.  He adopts a cat, a mean cat that has a "fire in his heart" that T.J. wants his ball team to have.  That is why the name of Rhubarb is given to the cat.  The team at first cannot stand being the laughing stock of the baseball world with a "cat" as the mascot.  When another team brings a dog to chase Rhubarb the cat is the victor and the team slowly begins to behave with the "fighting spirit of the cat."  Before T.J. can see all of this he dies and leaves his baseball team to Rhubarb with Ray Milland "Eric Yaeger" as the protector of the cat.  This "cat team" starts to win and win and win.  A must see comedy for all.</p>
