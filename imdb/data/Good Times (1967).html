<h1>Good Times (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Done in a similar style to the musical duo's TV show "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour", this film is more a series of unconnected skits and parodies than a single running plot. When Sonny gets offered a role in a movie, he talks Cher into giving it a try. The proposed script, however, turns out to be awful, but in order to get out of doing this stinker of a project, Sonny has just ten days to come with his own better script. The rest of the film follows his daydreams as he plots out possible storylines starring him as a Wild West sheriff, a jungle king, and as a private eye.</p>
<p>Sonny and Cher spoof many Hollywood classic movie scenes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you enjoy off the wall humor, and have a fondness for 60's nostalgia, you will like this movie (in my opinion). I found the film to be good-natured, a bit silly in spots, and touched with a slightly warped sense of humor that held my attention for the relatively short run-time. I just wish that Cher had a larger role in this one, but, I guess (at the time), Sonny was considered the real "talent." Granted, Sonny can't sing very well (especially so when compared to Cher), however, he seems to be having a "good time" making the movies within the movie. The Western spoof is especially entertaining.This is a guilty pleasure movie. It amused me, made me smile a few times, and that is enough for me to recommend it!</p>
