<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remembered this film from my youth - I only saw it once in the cinema, and when A & E carried it on their movie line-up a couple of years ago it brought back all those feelings that I had for this particular film. What a story. I love the characters, especially Oliver Reed - who really fills almost every frame with his menacing presence. It was refreshing to watch a film that was made before encroaching "political correctness", and it dealt with some terrific social and personal issues all with the glorious backdrop of British Columbian wilderness.</p>
