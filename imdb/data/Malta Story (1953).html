<h1>Malta Story (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1942 Britain was clinging to the island of Malta since it was critical to keeping Allied supply lines open. The Axis also wanted it for their own supply lines. Plenty of realistic reenactments and archival combat footage as the British are beseiged and try to fight off the Luftwaffe. Against this background, a RAF reconnaissance photographer's romance with a local girl is endangered as he tries to plot enemy movements.</p>
<p>On Malta while in transit to Cairo, Flt. Lt. Peter Ross, an aerial reconnaissance specialist, finds himself assigned to duty on the beleaguered island. Located only 57 miles from the coast of Sicily, Malta was a key Naval and Air base during World War II. During one of the frequent air raids, he meets a local girl and wants to marry her. Life is precarious however and the local population in particular suffered severe hardships. Apart from the daily bombings they faced severe food shortages with only limited access to the island by Allied convoys. In 1942, King George VI awarded the island the George Cross, the civilian equivalent of the Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>In WW2, the island of Malta, strategically located and vital to supply lines in the Mediterranean Sea, is fiercely attacked by the Germans but staunchly defended by the British.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is a gripping story that is told about the efforts made to make use  of that stationary aircraft carrier in the middle of the Mediterranean. It  is also poignant that Alec Guinness should play the part of a  reconnaissance pilot because it is just this ruse that the British used  to pretend that they hadn't broken the Italian and German ciphers thus  enabling them to sink all the Gerry troop ships and always be just in  time everywhere.A lame performance by the cast is diverted by the backdrop of a  desperate situation on a tiny island that has been invaded by every  great power since anyone can remember. If Ultra hadn't done it stuff  these people would have been run over even though the Axis forces would  have lost the war in the long run.</p>
