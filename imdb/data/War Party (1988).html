<h1>War Party (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of re-enactors attempt to stage a hundred year anniversary battle between US Cavalry and Blackfeet Indians. Unfortunately racial hostilities and a real gun lead to some all too real casualties, and three young Blackfeet men are caught in the middle. The film follows their flight for freedom in the face of an angry community which has mistakenly blamed them for the violence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Long and forgotten, this movie depiction of young Native-America is indeed a heart twister and adds fire to the burning soul. I was fortunate enough to see this film the year it was released, and was blown away with the story concept. I believe with the exception of "Kevin Dillon" (who by the way is an incredible actor), really wasn't convincing enough to play even a half-breed in this particular film.Strongly enough, however he does manage to pull it off, even though he wasn't my first choice for this film, I have viewed his performances in other astounding movies such as "Platoon" and the sort, where his personal character finds more of it's true calling. Just not this film. Overall however it is a powerful cut and slowly sucks you in, with a surprise bar fight confrontation that later turns out to be more then was expected, of course leading into the courageous plot of the film. Where you just want to see the Indian's win, just this once. But do they? Well you'll just have to hunt this bad boy down to find out. But "Good Luck" trying to find this flick especially on DVD it's a tough one. Especially since it blew over so many peoples heads, the first time around. As for me...I still can see the vivid storyline as it echoes through the spotlights of my mind, even several years later. Great story! But quite underrated! A film you'll never forget. If you ever get the chance, See it!</p>
