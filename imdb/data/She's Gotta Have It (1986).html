<p>A window into the life and loves of a young black woman in Brooklyn. Nola Darling is dating three very different men simultaneously: Jamie Overstreet -- a controlling, protective, patriarchal type; Greer Childs -- a wealthy, vain, arrogant male model; and Mars Blackmon -- a comical, juvenile, immature jokester. Nola has gone beyond even a love "triangle" and the stability of this love "square" is threatened by the increasing jealousy among her three suitors. Finally, under pressure, Nola makes her "choice," but in the end, is this what she really wants?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When reviewing all of Spike's work, this is hands down, probably my all-time favorite. This project introduced us to the incomparable Mars Blackman, Spike's oh so charming alter ego. "She's Gotta Have It" is a wonderful treatise on the art of love and war from interesting perspectives. On top of that, it is quite hilarious.It is a refreshing look at a black woman who insists on taking control of her sexuality rather than allowing it to be defined by men. There are general male observations, general female observations, and specific cultural outlooks on the art of love and war from an African-American perspective.Tracy Camilla Johns, beautifully portraying the wonderfully developed character, Nola Darling, is perfectly cast as the independent black woman who, in her quest to be sexually independent, realizes this is an uphill journey when dealing with men who still have traditional ideas about women and their roles. She was actively dating more than one man simply because she had adapted the attitude that no one man can provide everything she wanted/needed and furthermore, it was terribly unfair to label her promiscuous for doing so. Interestingly enough, Nola also found that her own reactions when coming up against the same attitude in men, were amazingly traditional.This was a very well-written statement on the ups and downs of love. It also introduces us to Law & Order's Divine Epatha Merkerson in a short but pivotal role as a sex therapist.Eeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent movie!!!</p>
