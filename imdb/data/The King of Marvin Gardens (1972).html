<h1>The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>'It's Monopoly out there'. Jason Staebler, The King of Marvin Gardens, has gone directly to jail, lives on the Boardwalk and fronts for the local mob in Atlantic City. He is also a dreamer who asks his brother, David, a radio personality from Philadelphia to help him build a paradise on a Pacific Island - asking him to believe in yet another of his dreams, yet another of his get-rich-quick schemes. But luck is against them both and the game ends badly - real life reduced to radio drama.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A truly great film and sadly overlooked and under rated, following up Five Easy Pieces and showing Nicholson at his most awesome.  A far better take on Atlantic City than the Louis Malle's film of that name.  Incredible acting from Nicholson, Dern, Burstyn... great direction and cinamatography.  The movie is set in a pre-casino Atlantic City, sort of Coney Island perfected. A real actors film that we rarely see anymore.  Perhaps difficult to watch because of that yet immensely rewarding.  A film that perfectly captures the time and place.  Dern plays an over the top hustler while Nicholson, of all things, plays an intellectual radio dweeb.  Go on... see it...  "no one reads anymore..."</p>
