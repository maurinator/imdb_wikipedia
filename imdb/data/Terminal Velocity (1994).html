<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a shame to see Deran Sarafian has ended up directing episodes of TV shows because he proves with this, his  best film, that he's a very competent hand at the helm of a big action film. Admittedly he's helped by the two leads,  Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski, who have the C-word... Chemistry, not to mention the villains, James  Gandolfini and Chris McDonald who have the B-word... Baddy?The stunt work is both impressive and breath taking because you can see it's genuine  witness the nail biting  scene involving a car in free fall  would it be half as exciting if it was done with CGI? With a script full of great  comedy moments it all adds up to a very enjoyable way to spend 100 minutes. 7/10</p>
