<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As another user has said, this is some of Coleman's best work.  An overlooked film for a bland plot and story, this film gives Coleman a place to shine.  To be sure, the acting of the others is very good, as well, and they deserve credit for a job well done, but this is obviously his film. I spotted this film on network television and I usually avoid films with commercial interruptions, but I like DC and gave it a shot for him.  I am very glad that I did.  He pulls this film up by it's bootstraps from a two to a six.  6 of 10</p>
