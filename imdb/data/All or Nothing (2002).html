<h1>All or Nothing (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Penny's love for her partner, taxi-driver Phil, has run dry. He is a gentle, philosophical guy, and she works on the checkout at a supermarket. Their daughter Rachel cleans in a home for elderly people, and their son Rory is unemployed and aggressive. The joy has gone out of Phil's and Penny's life, but when an unexpected tragedy occurs, they are brought together to rediscover their love. All or Nothing is set on a London working-class housing estate over a long weekend, and also tells the stories of a range of Phil and Penny's neighbors, some of whom become involved in the family's lives, and all of whom experience an emotional journey.</p>
<p>The dysfunctional lives of three working class families living in an apartment complex in south London are presented. Divorc√©e Maureen works as a cashier at a supermarket, while earning extra money doing laundry for neighbors. Her waitress daughter Donna of late has had a "none of your business" attitude with her mother, despite not yet realizing that she probably needs her mother's support more now, especially with regard to the abusive relationship she has with her boyfriend, Jason. Ron, a cabbie, and unemployed Carol's marriage is centered on drinking, Carol who is only barely functioning. Their unemployed daughter Samantha, who basically hangs around the apartment complex, is always at odds especially with her mother as she looks for some sort of attention from anyone. Samantha openly lusts after Jason, while she also secretly fosters the obsessive attention of a boy named Craig as an alternative. Phil, a cabbie at the same second rate company as Ron, and Penny, a fellow cashier at the same supermarket as Maureen, are in a long term common law relationship. Their relationship, which used to be a loving one, is in a catch-22 downward spiral as Penny, in an effort to ensure financial security and emotional stability for their family, continuously but quietly gripes at Phil, who doesn't work hard at his job as he has basically shut down out of his depression, which Penny does not realize. The nature of their family life affects their two children, somber Rachel, who works as a cleaner at a care facility, and unemployed Rory, an angry and overweight young man who is either sleeping, watching TV, eating or secretly smoking when he is not arguing especially with his mom, who he believes is always griping at him. A serious incident happens at the apartment complex. Beyond the negative aspect of the incident itself, it makes one of those families at least acknowledge the reason for their dysfunction, and thus potentially get out of it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mike Leigh makes this movie as a sociological study because he wants us to be confronted with the state of mind of the working class of now. There is more poverty in the slums nowadays than say twenty years ago!  Family-life is disrupted and children have many problems: overweight, sexual harassment, abortion (?).  How will the rent be paid?  And the loan of the taxi?  What is going on in the mind of our son who does only look television and eat until he becomes fat?  Why is my woman unhappy, do we still talk to each other?  We are proud of our daughter who is a nurse for elderly people, but what is happening with our son? Even the dialogues in the taxi are splendid!</p>
