<h1>It's Only Money (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lester is a clumsy and awkward TV repair man who is nevertheless gifted technically. In helping out a friend, he is drawn into a mystery involving a missing heir in a rich family. He begins to notice little things, like how much those family portraits look like him. Surely..no..he can't be...can he ?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this offering, Jerry was a stupid television repairman who is an heir to a fortune that an unscrupulous attorney wants for himself. Many attempts are made to insure that Jerry does not live to get the inheritance. Of course, they all fail. The action was so predictable that I considered the whole show to be very dull - just so much more slapstick Jerry.</p>
