<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Regardless of the negative comments about this film I think Sibling Rivalry is a brilliant comedy. The all-star cast were fantastic and hilarious in their roles and boy was it really funny and entertaining throughout. This is a really great movie that will keep you laughing although there are some serious drama in between this is an enjoyable film. Scott Bakula is the only reason I watched this film in the first place and I thought he was just brilliant. Scott plays Harry who's from a family of doctors with Carrie Fisher as Iris she plays his sister and Harry's brother is played by Sam Elliot as Charles. Kirsty Alley is beautiful and fantastic as Marjorie she's just married to Harry and happy for a while until she grows bored and frustrated that they never make love. Unhappy and unsatisfied she meets a man in a shopping store this soon leads them both to a hotel room where she spends the night with him. After that what happens is through funny consequences and it's completely funny. The whole cast do a brilliant and are all great fun to watch. I'd give this film a try if your just looking for laughs because I certainly enjoyed this film very much.</p>
