<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to disagree with just about every critic in the world.  I completely love this movie. (No spoilers that wouldn't come from a preview or the back of the movie box included)True, there is constant voice-over narriation.  But this based-on-a-true-story-scandal movie involves a complicated plot.  Without the help of one of our tried-and-true secondary characters.  The historical characters, though obviously given modern color, are convincingly portrayed. Hilary Swank gives innocent looks as she lies shamelessly.  As the plot thickens, so does the number of fun players.  Christopher Walken seems to relish in his part of mystical cheater.  Adrian Brody seems to really enjoy playing the philandering jerk, banging back whiskey and happily flirting with all young actresses (street-walkers) he sees.  Jonathan Pryce actually made me fear him as the corrupt cardinal.  Impressive from the man I last saw as the kindly father in Pirates of the Carribean.The most lovable character, by far, is Retaux.  The cheerful court-wise gigilo mutters some of the funniest lines in the movie, and runs a full gamut of emotions, from flirtatious to distraught.Joely Richardson plays a WONDERFUL ultimately doomed by history queen. Her sweet naievety combined with indifferent ignorance paints a reasonably possible image of the French monarchy at the time.Oh sure, the movie's not totally perfect.  Really, there are two things that bothered me. (1) The all over the place accents.  But I'm willing to forgive it.  After all, the movie's set in France.  They're not speaking French, so they're not going to fool me into thinking they're French anyway.  (2) The sunglasses worn by Joely Richardson and Christopher Walken.  Quite forgivable, but still made my eyebrows raise.On the whole this movie exceeded my expectations tenfold.  The great costumes, powerful music, and tense time period give the actors a playground where it's next to impossible to fall flat.  But not a one of them would have anyway.</p>
