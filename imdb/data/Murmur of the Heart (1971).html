<h1>Murmur of the Heart (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is a jolly coming-of-age story about a 14-year-old boy named Laurent Chevalier who is growing up in bourgeois surroundings in Dijon, France. This is France in the mid-1950s rather than America in the 1990s. Thus, Laurent is unharmed by events which would irreparably shatter the self-esteem of a modern American adolescent: he gets drunk, he smokes, he has sex, he is smothered by his mother, he is ignored by his father, a priest makes a pass at him, he gets rheumatoid fever, etc. There's enough scandalous behavior in this film to make 100 made-for-TV movies, and yet this is a very happy and oddly innocent tale.</p>
<p>A coming of age story set in the 1950s where a young teenager, Laurent Chevalier, learns about life with help from his older brothers and his mother Clara. As the youngest in the family Laurent is alternately smothered with affection or roundly ignored. His brothers take him out drinking in a club-brothel where he also loses his virginity. Things get a bit more complicated however when he and his mother go on holiday.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my all-time favorite films.Young Laurent Chevalier, his mother & his roguish elder brothers break every taboo known to small-town 1950s Dijon: underage drinking, underage sex, blasphemy, incest, petty theft, adultery, art forgery, whoremongering, drunk driving... What more can you ask? Malle treats their escapades with such lighthearted sympathy & wit you can't help liking them.Before I first saw Souffl√© au Coeur, I read a blurb for it in the monthly listings of my local repertory cinema that ran something like this (I quote from memory): "This film does a lot to restore the French to their former reputation for sophisticated naughtiness." I can't sum it up any better than that.</p>
