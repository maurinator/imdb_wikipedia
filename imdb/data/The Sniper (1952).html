<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Before one word of dialog is uttered in THE SNIPER, we witness a troubled San Francisco youth, Eddie (Arthur Franz) aim a rifle at a kissing couple.  The gun is empty, and Eddie breaks down crying as the unsuspecting couple smooch.   From then on, this obscure 1952 classic follows Eddie as he goes on a systematic killing spree.  We also follow detecives Adolphe Menjou and Richard Kiley rationalizze the insanity and finally close in on Eddie.  This film is rich in classic scenes- Eddie, who we know is uncomfortable with women, confronting sexy Marie Windsor.  The  suspenseful scene where a smokestack painter points out Eddie, the rooftop sniper.   Eddie screams at the man to shut up, but they are clearly a half mile away from each other.  All this is done in one deep focus shot.  My favorite scene is when the police line up and question local sex offenders (Cop to other cops, pointing to man in line up "This is a tough guy.... with small animals."  Classic noir.</p>
