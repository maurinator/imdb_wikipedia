<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why this title is no long in print is beyond me. This is one of the great love stories. It was truly wonderful, with great direction and acting. So much so that you really feel you know the characters...and how often does that happen in a movie now-a-days. Although some may no have liked it due to the sex scene, I think the sex scene was well done and very real. But the best part was when Thierry Lhermitte was trying to find Karen Allen at the airport...I was right on the edge of my seat! I really what them to find each other. If anyone from MGM/UA ever reads this please bring the film out in DVD...PLEASE.</p>
