<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The "plot outline" above is not correct... Countryman finds a young woman AND her boyfriend after their plane crashes in the countryside. the plane was flown by the boyfriend who happens to be a CIA agent and is smuggling guns, not marijuana.This movie is more about the music and magic of Jamaica and Rastafari than it is about great plot lines and tricky movie-making. The movie makers actually wrapped the movie around the music and the mysticism and naturalism of Rasta. The actors are mostly locals who were put to work based on their looks, particularly Countryman who the plot was built around (whose real name is not Countryman, but since the making of the movie has become known as Countryman.) A great movie, albeit a little campy.</p>
