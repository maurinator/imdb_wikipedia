<h1>Paradise (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Victorian period, two teenagers, David and Sarah, travel with a caravan from Baghdad to Damascus. At an oasis, the white slave agent known as the Jackal raids them, mainly to add the beautiful young Sarah to his harem. Only David and Sarah narrowly escape, and all the others are slayed in the massacre. Their flight leads them to a beautiful oasis - their paradise - where they discover love and sex. However, the Jackal has not given up on Sarah yet, and David must lure him to his death, or be killed by him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film in 1982 when I was 14 years old (purpose:  to see the much publicized full frontal nudity of the aptly named co-star Willie Aames.)  The short scene (pun intended) did not impress me, nor did Aames' acting.  However, Phoebe was such a strong confident actress she became my favorite actress.  She followed with a terrific list of credits, most notably Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Private School (so-so movie but she was great in it), Lace I and II (excellent TV pictures), Gremlins I and II, Date With An Angel, Bright Lights Big City, Heart of Dixie, Shag, Drop Dead Fred, and Bodies Rest and Motion.  Paradise is a Blue Lagoon rip-off but there are not too many films in that specific genre (Blue Lagoon 2, Castaway, Paradise 2) so I am glad they made the film.  Besides, despite it's lack of originality, it is a good film.  I think women young and old will enjoy the film (14 years and up due to tasteful appropriate nude scenes) because of it's romantic fantasy and strong female role, and I think guys will as long as they like a beautiful woman cavorting nude on a lost isle.</p>
