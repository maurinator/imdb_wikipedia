<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best baseball movie I've ever saw. Mark Harmon known for his role in St.Elsewhere was awesome at playing Billy. Jodie Foster was great at playing the dead friend. This movie was filled with nostalgia. The music the memories, and the magic of getting back the love of an all-time sport, Baseball. My favorite was when Young Billy finds out that Robin would only bare her soul to him. To me, if a girl like that who had very strong feelings I would not run off. Except shouting when you had the time of your life! That was a good one in my book. The sad part is when Billy's father died in a car accident. And Katie (Foster), told Billy what she did when she got sad. When Billy was younger, he did have a crush on Katie, when he got older, his feelings for her were still there. Now after wards, Katie finds love overseas, but when heartache fell upon her, she would later take her own life. And Billy fulfills her final wish: to fly far away. He also rekindled with Robin, after a failed marriage. Life is like baseball, we hit home-runs, we strikeout, most of all, when you got the chance, STEAL HOME!Everything else will follow through out of every scene you watch. This movie deserves a 10!</p>
