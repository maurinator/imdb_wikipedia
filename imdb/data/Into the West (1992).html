<h1>Into the West (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A gigantic white stallion appears mysteriously to a Traveller grandfather and his two grandsons in an Irish slum. Since, puzzlingly, the younger of the two boys is the only individual who can control the horse, ownership falls to him and his older brother by default. There being no place for the animal, they move him into the apartment of their alcoholic Traveller father. Police remove him and, in a shady deal, he ends up under control of a wealthy, underhanded horse breeder. The boys manage to retrieve him and escape on his back, but the stallion seems to have his own travelling agenda.</p>
<p>Grandpa Ward gives a horse he found to his grandchildren, who keep it in their tower-block flat in Dublin. The horse is stolen from them, and the two young boys set out to find it and flee on it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This excellent movie deals with issues of identity, death and family.  It is also a very funny and gentle fantasy (set in contemporary times) about two Irish boys and their magical horse.This may sound silly to many.  I wouldn't even fault anyone for having passed on it during its initial theatrical release or for passing it by in the video store.  The marketing of this movie made it seem like a wacky, silly movie about kids getting into and out of several situations with their horse.  The only reason I even saw it was faith in the cast and crew.  I feel I was well rewarded.The performances are exceptional.  The two boys behave in a completely natural way without resorting to traditional "cutesy" mannerisms and expressions (which isn't to say the movie does not have its cute moments. ..it's just that they don't seem forced when they happen).  Gabriel Byrne's performance is absolutely beautiful.  Even though the movie is about the kids and the horse (at first glance) it really is about him and his character's denial of what he really is and how he is set right again.The cinematography, direction and music are all superb. You won't be disappointed if you just give it a chance.</p>
