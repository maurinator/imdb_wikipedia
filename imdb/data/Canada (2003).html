<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dumb blond anchor Jonathan Cross travels Canada in a Winnebego finding the little stories of the little people with his hapless silent producer Philip Pearson in this 6 episode CBC sketch/reality send up comedy series.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this series, one that CBC just didn't give a decent chance to. Having run just 6 episodes, the show was a great spoof of the peculiar Canadian phenomenon of the "retired-newscaster-and-his-RV" anthology genre, featuring Harvey Kirck, Keith Morrison, Peter Trueman and probably others in the 1980s and 1990s. This was arguably the best vehicle for promoting actor Jonathan Torrens, whose Jonovision was a hit for Mother CBC.Co-star Gary Pearson, also a writer of many of the segments, stole many scenes as Cross's mute producer Philip, who didn't appear to have any particular use, other than his uncanny ability to find a Starbucks in secluded locales. Cross's air-headed female protégé (whose measurements are indelibly etched into my brain, but whose name escapes me) was some interesting eye-candy to enjoy.So much to enjoy about Jonathan Cross's Canada! The hilarious piece about the Siamese twins, one of whom was gay: The psychotic Christmas lady who celebrated Christmas 365 days a year and her imprisoned husband Klaus; The short French-Canadian who saved a family from a fire he caused from falling asleep smoking; The famous hockey announcer who retired to life behind a convenience store counter and on and on and on.C'mon, CBC! You ditched this gem for The Sean Cullen Show? Tsk, tsk, tsk....</p>
