<h1>The Angel Levine (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Morris Mishkin is a elderly religious Jew in New York. His wife Fanny is very ill. He's a tailor, but he can't work because his back has given out. He doesn't even have enough money for Fanny's medicine. Finally, a black fellow appears from nowhere in the Mishkin kitchen. He says he's an angel from God, sent to help Mishkin. The black angel is even Jewish, named Alex Levine? But will Morris believe in the angel? And can the angel perform the miracle that he promises?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Any film starring Zero Mostel is worth watching, and The Angel Levine is no exception. Sadly the film has aged rather poorly, with Harry Belafonte's hipster jive clearly belonging in the New York City of 30 years ago. Whether the film should be viewed literally, as a tale of personal redemption and healing, or as the fable most reviewers assume it to be, is uncertain. There's enough good acting here--especially from Mostel and Ida Kaminska as his dying wife--to recommend this strange little art piece.</p>
