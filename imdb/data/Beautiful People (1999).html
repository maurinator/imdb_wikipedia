<h1>Beautiful People (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In London, during October 1993, England is playing Holland in the preliminaries of the World Cup. The Bosnian War is at its height, and refugees from the ex-Yugoslavia are arriving. Football rivals, and political adversaries from the Balkans all precipitate conflict and amusing situations. Meanwhile, the lives of four English families are affected in different ways by encounter with the refugees; one of the families improbably becomes involved with a Balkan refugee through the England vs. Holland match.</p>
<p>The time is 1993 when the Bosnian War is taking place, and the place is Britain. Through interweaving stories, the lives of some native Britons and Bosnian refugees settled in Britain intersect, or are directly influenced by what is happening back in Bosnia. Nurse in training, Portia Thornton, falls in love with one of her patients, Bosnian Pero Guzina, much to the chagrin of her upper crust family who just don't understand this foreigner. Dr. Mouldy, a maternity ward doctor, takes a special interest in the upcoming birth to a Bosnian couple who, for reasons from the war, don't want their baby-to-be. The doctor's interest is in part due to his own crumbling family life. BBC war correspondent Jerry Higgins is injured from his time covering the war and as a result is permanently physically disabled. He ends up having an unusual wish for himself and will go to extreme lengths to achieve it. Troubled and drug addicted youth, Griffin Midge, has a life altering experience when he unexpectedly gets to see the effects of the war up close and personal. And a feud erupts between an ethnic Serb and an ethnic Croat who by circumstance are forced to spend much time together.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am going to limit my comments basically to all those people who rated this movie below a nine or ten. For most people this is a movie that must be watched twice, but if you don't feel your heart pounding at the end of the film and tears in your eye, no matter how many times you watch, YOU, viewer needs to take stock of your own heart, imagination, empathy for different people (true diversity) and your ability to respond appropriately to truly great films. I tire of people who tell me about books and plays and movies:"It's just your opinion." Well, sometimes that is true. But if your soul and imagination has not been properly educated by reading good books (especially poetry), seeing good plays (especially Shakespeare, and seeing quality movies and distinguishing them from the meretricious and the bogus. This is not a time where it is just my opinion. This is a movie that celebrates life in the most difficult of situations and blends together various characters' lives into a seamless whole--a kind of good Magnolia, to which it has been fatuously compared. The story is set in diverse modern day London--all classes, different ethnic groups etc. The writer/director Jazmin Didmar is a magician weaving a tapestry of humanity that screams at the viewer: "LIfe is tough, but there is still a place for love and beauty, even in the direst circumstances." I am so fed up with American movie goers who can't tell diamond from glass. This is a wonderful movie which deserves a 10+ rating. I quote from one of the characters, who is having troubles in his personal life and in his profession. But he comes through at the end of the movie happy and smiling with an ending comment: "If life works just a little bit in your favor, it can be beautiful." SEE THIS MOVIE. (p.s. Americans can be forgiven their lack of discernment in films, because they grow up on wretched American t.v. By the way I am a natural born surfer boy from SoCAl--actually Orange County).</p>
