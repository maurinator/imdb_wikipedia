<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>New Orleans businessman Michael Courtland's life is shattered when his wife and daughter are tragically killed in a botched kidnap rescue attempt. Many years later whilst visiting Italy he meets and falls in in love with Sandra Portinari, who bears a striking resemblance to his wife.</p>
<p>Successful New Orleans businessman Michael Courtland's tenth wedding anniversary celebration ends tragically when his wife Elizabeth and their nine-year-old daughter, Amy, have been kidnapped. In an attempt to trap the criminals, counterfeit money is used to pay the ransom, but the plan backfires and his wife and child die in a car accident during a chase with the police. Ten years later while on a business trip in Italy with La Salle, his partner, Michael meets Sandra, a young woman who is an exact double of his wife. He falls in love with her and brings her back to Louisiana to get married. Michael's friends and business associates try to discourage his wedding plans; they realize that Michael is infatuated with Sandra only because she reminds him of his dead wife Elizabeth. On the eve of their wedding, she vanishes and Michael finds a ransom note - a duplicate of the one found ten years earlier.</p>
<p>New Orleans based land developer Michael Courtland still mourns the death of his wife Elizabeth Courtland and their adolescent daughter Amy Courtland sixteen years earlier in 1959 from a botched kidnapping. What's worse for Mike is that he feels guilty for the deaths and that the burned and drowned bodies of the two were never recovered, the only memorial he has for them being a scale model and empty mausoleum of the Florentine church where he and Elizabeth met, the mausoleum sitting on an expensive piece of property he now refuses to develop, much to the chagrin of his business partner, Bob LaSalle. On a business trip to Florence, Mike goes back to that church to find a woman who looks exactly like Elizabeth, she being Sandra Portinari, who is working on an art restoration project inside the church. Mike is immediately smitten with his wife's lookalike. Sandra, despite eventually learning why Mike is so smitten with her, still falls for him. The two decide to go back to New Orleans to get married. In New Orleans, Mike faces a sense of déjà vu of an incident sixteen years earlier. And Sandra, unknown to Mike, brings her own emotional baggage into their relationship.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>...or  rather nightmarish,this is probably De Palma"s finest achievement.Here his obsession with Alfred Hitchcock is subdued or thoroughly mastered.Of course we cannot help but thinking of "Vertigo" but De Palma's work is made with taste :two good leads -Cliff Robertson,whose eyes seem to reflect fatality,and Genevieve Bujold whose beauty seems to plunge the audience into a dream(the sequence in the church makes her look like a madonna)-.Besides,Bernard Herrman's score is absolutely mind-boggling,enhancing the strangest sequences in an almost religious incantation.The cinematography is up to scratch,and the directing remains sober.The Hitchcock quotations take a back seat to De Palma's talent:compare this work with the grand guignol of "Carrie" the follow-up,the sensationalism tinged with melodrama of "fury" (no,it's not a remake of the Fritz Lang classic),the plagiarism of "dressed to kill" or "Body double".One may regret the last pictures in slow motion.But that's minor quibble.This is De Palma's magnum opus,and it will be "blow out" before he puts out a genuinely personal movie.Do not miss it.</p>
