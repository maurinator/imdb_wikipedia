<h1>Freddy Got Fingered (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gordon, 28, an aspiring animator, leaves his home in Oregon to sell his ideas to Hollywood. After being told, correctly, that they are quite possibly the most stupid ideas ever and that he needs to spend time rethinking them, he moves back home. But his father, never a kind man, escalates his mean treatment of his rather unconventional son. Meanwhile, Gord has fallen for Betty, an attractive doctor at the hospital where his friend is staying; she happens to use a wheelchair, and to delight in having her paralyzed legs beaten with a bamboo cane; her sexual aggression intimidates him. Gord's family goes to a psychiatrist, and he lies to her that his father molests Gord's brother, Freddy; Gord neglects to mention that Freddy is 25. Soon, Gordon has the house to himself, and comes up with a winning animated series, "Zebras in America" based on his own family. All this is really a framework on which Tom Green hangs his usual crazy stunts.</p>
<p>Tom Green plays Gord Brody, a slacker who dreams of becoming an animator for cartoon shows. He is forced to move back in with his parents, but then refuses to leave. Along the way, he sexually pleasures various farm animals, licks open flesh wounds, accuses his father of molesting his brother, goes scuba diving in a toilet, plays an organ with several sausages attached to it which are suspended in midair, and does a bunch of other stuff that is too insane, offensive, disgusting, or weird to be mentioned here.</p>
<p>An unemployed cartoonist moves back in with his parents and younger brother Freddy. When his parents demand he leave, he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Actually, it's not even that good.  It is more like the loamy layer of decaying excrement located under an old sun baked pile of hog dung.  I will reconstruct this car wreck.Movie Producer 1 - Let's give Tom Green a pile of money and let him make a movie, I hear the kids at MTV love him.Movie Producer 2 - You bet they do, but we can't edit or censor him because the kids like his honesty and in your face attitude.Movie Producer 1 - Okay then, here's a blank check and tell Tom to make up a movie this weekend.  By the way, do you know anything about Mr. Green except the fact that kids love him?Movie Producer 2 - I think he's Canadian!Movie Producer 1 - Like Jim Carrey!Movie Producer 2 - You bet.Movie Producer 1 - Well goddarn, forget the script, start shooting right now!  Tell Tom he's got the afternoon to think of something funny, he likes that improv stuff.  Make sure he gets in your face and outrageous.  If he gets stuck for ideas, give him this old Carrot Top movie script we were going to make when we thought he was funny.Hence we are left with Freddie Got Fingered.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being Citizen Cane and 1 being a hidden toilet camera of a person defecating, this is a 0.9.</p>
