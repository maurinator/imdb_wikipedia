<h1>Butley (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A day in the life of Ben Butley. But definitely not a day to remember for this T.S. Eliot scholar at the University of London! Let's take for example Anne, his already estranged wife: today is the day she has chosen to tell him she is leaving him for good. And for a man Butley despises into the bargain! And what about Joey Kingston, whose close friendship Ben is losing, maybe forever today...? Decidedly, all the odds are against him. Will Butley, the bitter misanthropist, the unrepentant alcoholic, the teacher who bullies his students, his friends and his colleagues - in other words the self-destructive nihilist -, survive this horrible day?</p>
<p>An English professor finds his life crumbling around him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first saw this film, Ben Butley fascinated me (my cousin, who saw it with me, hated him). I've seen the film many times since then--I bought the video before I had a VCR to play it on--and it remains my favorite movie. And Alan Bates remains my favorite actor, although he's not at all like Butley. I wouldn't recommend the film to everybody, because it's a filmed play, totally in one room, all talk. Ah, but what talk, what dynamics between characters, what vicious game-playing and ruthlessness and humor. Simon Gray's never written a better play.</p>
