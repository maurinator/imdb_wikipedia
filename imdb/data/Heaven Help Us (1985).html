<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although this movie does not involve sexual abuse, it does however bring painful memories to many Catholics who grew up and went to Catholic school. The characters of people like Brother Constance are an example of the "bad apples" that lurked within the Catholic Church school system. It even shows how many of these Brothers who lead such a life are true misfits to society, as what John Heard's character admits when asked by Andrew McCarthy about why he became a brother.My mother watched this movie for the first time and it was a reminder of her days as a good little Catholic girl who was taught by some vicious nuns. Many Catholics and former Catholics will tell you this movie is truly an example of why people left the Church.</p>
