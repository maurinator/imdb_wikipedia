<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the novel by David Baldacci, Absolute Power is about the ruthlessness of people in power. The President believes that everything he does is beyond reproach, including an affair or two. That leads to murder and everyone around him is involved. There is only one witness, a thief named Luther Whitney. They are sure he'll talk, but when? The Secret Service is determined to keep him quiet, but catching a thief isn't always easy.</p>
<p>Luther Whitney is a professional thief, who only works occasionally. He is planning what is suppose to be his last job, and everything is going smoothly until some come in before he can leave. He hides in a secret room and from behind a one-way mirror sees that it's the wife of the owner of the house he is robbing and another man. They are fooling around when the guy decides to liven things up by striking her, she get away but he corners her, she then grabs a letter opener and is about to stab him when he cries out for help when two men come in and shoot her dead. It seems that the man is Alan Richmond, the President of the United States and the two men are the secret service agents assigned to him. Later, a woman, Gloria Russell, who is his Chief of Staff enters and upon learning of what has happened, decides to cover it up and make it appear that she was killed by a burglar. After sanitizing the room, they are about to leave but they forget the letter opener, Whitney comes out of the room and takes it and makes his getaway but when they returned for the letter opener they discover Whitney and chase him but he gets away. The police investigate the murder and there are so many inconsistencies, which makes the investigator, Seth Frank suspect that something is going on. Frank then discovers that Whitney is a possible suspect but the only thing is that he doesn't believe that Whitney is a killer. Whitney tries to leave town but when he learns just how corrupt and amoral Richmond is he decides to play mind games with him and the others. Richmond, at the same time, tells them that Whitney must be silenced permanently.</p>
<p>A career thief witnesses a horrific crime involving the U.S. President.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to say, that, ok maybe some of the actions of this film are a little manifested, but nevertheless, it holds for some nice suspense when it is required, and it also has a lot of eclectic moments(i.e. moments when the feeling is far from previous, yet conveyed appropriately). Besides the plot, this film has a wonderful, albeit short, soundtrack(composed by Clint), and good settings. A nice little ending on it too. Oh, and I have to say that Ed Harris is a excellent at 'doing' the sarcastic cop. I love it!</p>
