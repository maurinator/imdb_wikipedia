<h1>Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The tough biker Harley and his no less tough cowboy friend Marlboro learn that an old friend of theirs will lose his bar, because a bank wants to build a new complex there and demands 2.5 million dollars for a new contract in advance. Harley and Marlboro decide to help him by robbing the corrupt bank. They rob the Bank transport and get hold of an amount of a new synthetic drug. Now they are targeted by criminal bankers.</p>
<p>Forced by the imminent foreclosure of their friend's bar, two lifelong buddies will decide to rob a bank's armored car, not knowing that its cargo is not money, but a new street drug.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a loose remake of Butch and Sundance. The jokes are funny as hell when you know the Newman/Redford classic. Many of the scenes, many of the lines, are directly taken from it. If you know that film, you will appreciate this one much more.</p>
