<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK... this flick is not THAT bad. View it for what it is. Miss Oberon is beautiful in her last film... and if you like a romantic film from the 1940s, you will certainly enjoy this one. These days, they are giving Oscars to crap that couldn't hold a candle to this picture. Her costar (who would take up with Audrey Hepburn later after Miss Oberon's death) was a little stiff in acting department but this was Merle Oberon's picture from the start to finish. If you are a fan of hers, you will love it. Just view it for what it is: a good romantic movie that you could watch with your Mom. Not a single vulgar word in it. Very, very rare these days.</p>
