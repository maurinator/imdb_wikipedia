<h1>Hotshot (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of an American soccer player trying to make it big who turns to Pele, the greatest soccer player of all time, for guidance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie inspired me as a little kid to play soccer.  Pele, the legend himself, is in the movie, so that gives it instant credibility.  I highly recommend this movie to any true soccer fan, it is definitely low budget, but the soccer is awesome, especially since soccer isn't exactly big market in the U.S.</p>
