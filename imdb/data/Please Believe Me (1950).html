<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Silly bauble put over by expert comic players. This was early in Deborah Kerr's Hollywood career before From Here to Eternity moved her to the front ranks and Metro was still trying to figure out what to do with her. Here her English reserve is put to good use as the three men put the big rush on her and she slowly loosens up but always manages to keep them at bay by her brains and dignity. She always was a quite charming comedienne able to elevate material like this. The film also has several other excellent comic actors who similarly buoy the script with their charm. Peter Lawford wasn't much of a dramatic actor but for suave sophistication with a light touch, which is needed here, few were better. Two wonderful all around actors, Robert Walker and James Whitmore, are paired as a devious couple of wannabe swindlers who seem too goodhearted to be very successful at their work. The weak link, if he can be called that, is Mark Stevens, he's not bad but he lacks the breezy skill and screen presence of his fellow actors. The film is a minor credit on all the performers resume and one of the endless trifles churned out by MGM at its peak but on that basis it's a very pleasant diversion</p>
