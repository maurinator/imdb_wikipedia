<h1>The Tall Guy (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dexter King plays straight man to unpleasant comedian Ron Anderson. He falls in love with Kate, a pretty nurse he meets when he is receiving injections for hay fever. When Anderson fires him, he acquires the title role in a musical stage version of "The Elephant Man". Kate dumps him when she suspects he is having an affair with a fellow cast member, and he must win her back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wouldn't say this film is great outstanding art, but there is something about it. The way it is poking fun at the entertainment business (good to see Rowan Atkinson taking the p**s out of himself!)? The way it doesn't take the musical "Elephant" serious? Does the film take itself serious? I don't know really.The story as such is not worth a comment. The movie is hardly more than an array of hilarious scenes wrapped in an average love story. Though the love story seems not to be the major message, I was on the edge of the seat all the way through. There are so many clever jokes in this plot, at short intervals at that. Perhaps this makes the difference.Jeff Goldblum is doing well in this European style comedy (didn't expect him to). Emma is doing great too. The music is well chosen from the 80th Britpop charts... Only the ending goes a bit flat, but I can live with it.Finally I can't resist to comment on the sex scene. I was rolling on the ground, couldn't stop laughing. The best of its kind, by distance.</p>
