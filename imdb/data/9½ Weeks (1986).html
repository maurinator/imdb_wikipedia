<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An erotic story about a woman, the assistant of an art gallery, who gets involved in an impersonal affair with a man. She barely knows about his life, only about the sex games they play, so the relationship begins to get complicated.</p>
<p>Elizabeth McGraw, who works in an upscale Manhattan art gallery, is trying to get back onto her personal footing following the divorce from her husband Bruce, with who she is still on good terms. Although not prudish about sex, she does not think about it all the time, unlike her sex-obsessed best friend and coworker Molly. There is an immediate mutual attraction when Elizabeth meets high stakes Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray. Although cautious seeing as to her divorce, Elizabeth does enter into a relationship with John following a grand gesture on his part, despite not really knowing anything about him. That caution returns when John starts to push her sexual boundaries. However, she begins to trust him in her undeniable attraction to him. As their relationship progresses with him crossing one what was a sexual line after another for her and she succumbing to each, the questions become whether the crossing of any specific lines will destroy their relationship, especially as he does not open up about any other aspect of his personal self, and if so if those will have any long term effect on her psyche.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although generally rubbished by critics because of the two lead actors, among other things, this was an interesting film in that it attempted to be artistic, something of a rarity for Hollywood.  Much of what is presented was designed to look sexy, even if it was unlikely to be if you tried it yourself. And to give it its due, those responsible for art direction and cinematography did a pretty good job and it stands repeated viewings to pick up on nuances missed first time around.  It is tantalizing but not especially erotic; a lot more is suggested than actually happens.  Anyone who can remember working in an office in the 80s will relate to the telex machines, phones with bell-rings, and no desktop computer for the manger, and no mobile phones.  The 80s apartment decor and fashions will also jog memories.</p>
