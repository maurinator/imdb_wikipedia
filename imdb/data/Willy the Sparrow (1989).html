<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I study animation. Since am a little kid I watch this Sparrow animation. I think it's an very good animation, it inspires me enormously. The backgrounds, the music, and all phases of life being abstracted metaphorically. It's not hypocrite, like a lot of animations where, of that time. Kids watching, princes and princesses saving each other, get a wrong "fairy-tail" like impression of life, while this animation gives it a little bit of realism and vision, at least it's how I experienced it at an age of six. Please stop telling me that this animation is the reason for some irresponsible kids spraying poison in each other's faces. If someone is blaming this cartoon for some kids mindless behavior, u need to go to a psychologist for paranoia. Then hide your venomous cans and alcohol, next time u letting your kids play near that stuff. It got nothing to do with this animation.</p>
