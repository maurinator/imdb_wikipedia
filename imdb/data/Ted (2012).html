<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John makes a Christmas miracle happen by bringing his one and only friend to life, his teddy bear. The two grow up together and John must then choose to stay with his girlfriend or keep his friendship with his crude and extremely inappropriate teddy bear, Ted.</p>
<p>When he was eight years old, John Bennett, friendless and thus lonely, wished that his only friend, Ted his teddy bear who had a voice recorded message "I love you", would love him forever. John got his wish as Ted miraculously came to life, which garnered Ted his proverbial fifteen minutes of fame. Twenty-seven years later, John and Ted have remained best friends. Although physically the same, Ted now has grown-up urges, as vulgar, perverted and immature as they be. Although she loves John and likes Ted as John's friend, professionally successful Lori Collins, John's girlfriend of four years, believes that John's emotional immaturity and lack of professional drive - John works in a dead end job at Liberty Car Rental - is because of his friendship with Ted, with who he parties all the time. Although Lori does see John as being her husband one day, that cannot happen as long as the current situation with Ted remains. But other pressures may prevent a John-Lori happy ending. One is Rex, Lori's wealthy boss, who does whatever he can to make himself look good and John look bad in Lori's eyes, despite she showing no interest in him whatsoever. And two and three are father and son Donny and Robert, super-fans of Ted's who will go to any length to have a talking teddy bear as their own.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie promotes drug use and alcohol. The viewer is supposed to laugh on every profanity phrase. When you use profanity it must be good, it must be cheerful, it must be rare and smart, but this movie is depressing like any movie about drug abuse. I can not say anything bad about the actors. The idea itself, and the context is very depressing. It would be impossible for me to watch this movie second time.I can not understand why this movie received 7.3 points here. It is very hard now to find a good movie. The 80s were golden age for American movies, now you have to dig through at least 10 movies to find a good one.</p>
