<h1>August (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chekov's Uncle Vanya, transposed to turn-of-the-century North Wales, where the peace and tranquility of a country house is disturbed by the arrival of the estate's tyrannical owner and his American wife.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a shame to see the excellent actor, Anthony Hopkins, make such an inept effort at directing. This movie is about a group of miserable Welsh gentry who have nothing better to do than make each other as unhappy as they know how. This is a sort of childish attempt to imitate "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe" with a larger cast. There is no character that seems like a real person (other than in an institution) and will bore most anyone to sleep. I watched to the end just to see if Hopkins would improve with experience. He didn't.</p>
