<h1>Zig Zag (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A dying man frames himself for the kidnapping and murder of an industrialist so his wife and daughter can benefit from the reward money. However, his plan goes awry when he is cured!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The premise is familiar -- guy learns he's going to die, tries to find a way to leave his family provided for -- but it's presented in an interesting manner here, with Kennedy an appealing if unlikely lead.  All goes well until the ending, which is so outrageously wrong for the movie that it completely sinks the film.  A surprise ending is generally something many thrillers try for, but it has to be a surprise ending that satisfies the audience on some level, not one that throws the whole story back in their faces.</p>
