<h1>Escape from L.A. (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The year is 2013 and Snake Plissken is back but this time it's L.A., which through the agency of earthquakes has become an island of the damned. But something has gone wrong in this new moral order, because the President's daughter has absconded to L.A. with a detonation device, and Snake is commandeered to retrieve it. But just below the surface there is a coiled Snake ready to strike.</p>
<p>In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like its neighbor New York, has transformed from a wonderful city to a corrupted prison. Plus, The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the president's daughter, Utopia to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon the untrustworthy mercenary Snake Plissken. To ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus bomb inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, rescue Utopia and get back the Weapon's device.</p>
<p>The year is 2013 and Snake Plissken is back from Escape From New York. An earthquake has separated Los Angeles from the mainland. In the New Moral America, all citizens not conforming to the new laws (no smoking, no red meat, no Muslims in South Dakota) are deported to L.A., now a penal colony. The President's daughter has stolen a doomsday device and has fled to L.A. It's up to Snake Plissken to find the President's daughter and retrieve the doomsday device before its too late.</p>
<p>The year is 2013. Like New York, Los Angeles has been turned into a prison island for the United State's most undesirable criminals, like New York, Los Angeles is surrounded by a wall so no convict can escape from L.A and once deported to L.A. you can never return to the American mainland which has become a moral society. 16-years after he escaped from New York, One-Eyed former soldier Snake Plissken now the United State's most wanted outlaw is once again given another job for his freedom by the new President and L.A's security commander Malloy. Snake is sent into L.A. to recover a doomsday device that shuts all power sources on Earth from brutal terrorist Curevo Jones and the President's runaway daughter Utopia who has been brainwashed by Curveo into stealing the doomsday device, and the President personally wants Snake to eliminate Utopia for betraying her country. Like New York, Snake is injected with a engineered virus which will kill him in 9 hours if Snake fails the mission, if Snake succeeds in completing the mission, he will be given the antidote. Entering L.A, now inhabited by criminals, runaway teenagers, prostitutes and brutal gangs. Snake sets out to recover the doomsday device and kill Utopia, as Curevo and his army of terrorists prepares to invade the United States and can Snake escape from L.A. before the virus kills him in 9 hours?</p>
<p>Sequel to "Escape From New York". In 2000, a huge earthquake hits Los Angeles which causes the whole city to be now situated on an island. In that year the new life-term US President, an out-spoken moralist declares that all people not conforming to the high morals he sets for the country will be deported to the Los Angeles island. Like New York, a wall is built, guards posted to stop any escapes and if sent there - you can't return to the US. In 2013, Cuervo Jones, a terrorist invades the dreams of the President's daughter, Utopia, and brainwashes her into stealing a device from a weapons establishment and runs with Cuervo to the island. Snake Plissken, hero of Escape From New York, is forced again to go to the island to get the device by the President (who doesn't care if Utopia returns or not.) and he is poisoned to ensure his co-operation. Like New York, Los Angeles is now a decaying city, a hot-bed of scum and weirdos and Snake has 9 hours to find the device and Utopia, and get out before the poison kicks in.</p>
<p>Snake Plissken is once again called in by the United States government to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie, but I was really glad I watched it! Bad-ass Snake is back and his new assignment sees him enter a run-down LA in search of a 'black box'. Standard "Escape" stuff, again we assume he's been drugged and has no alternative.The visual effects come thick and fast: There is a mix of some really great effects early on and some equally awful ones, but as this was the dawn of "comic book style" films they're all totally acceptable in the film world. A lot of them were really nice, even the tacky nature of them still holds good value. But what I really liked were the epic long shots and large models that I thought really gave LA and edge over New York.The plot does twist and turn more than you expect. Just as I was getting to like Plisken's love interest...BLAM! Just as I thought some boring secondary cast member is about to join the plot - BAM - it's Steve Buscemi! The next minute Plissken is surfing a mini-tsunami through LA!! This film really delivers and personally I think it makes a great sequel to NY. There's more attention to sci-fi detail, some gripping sequences and wonderful locations. The supporting cast don't do a bad job of it either. There's dramatic irony and also whatever the reverse of dramatic irony is - bits you just won't predict happening...Kurt himself as Plissken is a joy to watch - never says a lot - you often wonder what he's thinking and Kurt plays this part of unease and uncertainty about Plissken really well. The fact Snake's reputation follows him in this film also adds to the fun factor.There's no need to take this movie in too deeply, I did not - and that way I really got into it and enjoyed the world it portrayed. The final shot of Plissken is hilarious and made me clap out loud because it's just the perfect final√© to the world of Snake.I really hope they bring Kurt back for a third film, because the effects could be at a whole new level in this day and age. And definitely get Shirley Walker and John Carpenter to write the music together. The progression in LA from Carpenter's classic slow synth style through to Walker's upbeat 20th century classical really interested me.If you're looking for light entertainment, a fairly mature sci-fi romp with Kurt Russell from a time when computer effects in films were really beginning (though the use of real locations (and some big ones!) were not to be outdone by computer graphics in this film) - be sure to watch this!! Oh and please finish the trilogy Kurt!! PHAT</p>
