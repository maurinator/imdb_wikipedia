<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In romantic Paris, two Parisians of Indian origin are in love namely Shyam or Sam and Roopa. Mystery and intrigue surround this romance, as Roopa is abducted and held by criminal mastermind Jack and his minions, who will trade her for a hefty ransom. Roopa has a look-alike in the shape and form of Suzy, who is sent in place of Roopa to ensure that the money is received, while the real Roopa is still being held captive. Sam must use all the resources available to in order to set Roopa free, but he will have a difficult time to differentiate between Suzy and Roopa.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen far more Bollywood films than the average American, though I am far from an expert on these movies. For a change of pace, I thought I'd try watching an older Indian film--to see what they looked like decades ago (most Indian films available in the US are much more recent)."An Evening in Paris" is about a couple of Indian ladies who, not surprisingly, go to Paris. However, one is very tired of men wanting her for her money, so she poses as the other's maid. Lots of kooky adventures, romance, a kidnapping and humor (such as it is) results. Other than the nice scenery, there really isn't a lot I liked about this film. The acting is just awful---very, very, very broad and the director seemed to encourage the actors to really ham it up for the audience. Subtle, this certainly isn't!! As a result, nothing about the film worked for me--it was so fake and plastic that I got VERY tired of the film and couldn't take it after a while. About the only thing I like about the film are a few of the musical numbers. While the sound quality of the songs is bad, they were catchy and easy to enjoy. I also liked some of the location shots during these songs--particularly the one in the Swiss Alps. Perhaps all this would play better for someone more familiar with and forgiving of the genre--I just thought it was rather dumb. Plus, how did so many Indians just happen to be in Paris?! I was there a few months back and didn't see Indians cavorting and singing anywhere in the city limits! Just my two cents worth.</p>
