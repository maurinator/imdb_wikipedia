<h1>Late Night Shopping (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Four young friends have tedious night jobs and meet every night after work in a café. Sean hasn't met his girlfriend in three weeks, Vincent flirts with everybody, Lenny is too afraid to ask a girl at work on a date and Jody can't admit that she shows up at the café every night, although she was fired some time ago.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Most of the votes for this film are 7-10 yet most of the comments are lukewarm to hostile, which baffles me as I found it consistently enjoyable, intelligently scripted and very well acted.  The only disappointment was that, although recognisably filmed in Glasgow, it appears to be set in some non-specific English city in which none-the-less all the minor characters have Scots accents.  Despite this I gave it a 9.</p>
