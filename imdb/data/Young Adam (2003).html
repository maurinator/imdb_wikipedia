<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an outstandingly acted and filmed story about an amoral person who is faced with a moral dilemma that few people would wish to find themselves in. The directing, lighting and cinematography are excellent, and the acting universally of a very high quality too.  It's a bleak, grim story in a bleak, grim setting, but it certainly isn't boring (unless you find good character development and scripting boring). There is a lot of sex, yes, but it isn't gratuitous. Those who think it is clearly have little idea of what the film is about.</p>
