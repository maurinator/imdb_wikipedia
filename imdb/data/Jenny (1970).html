<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To some who were either in soggy diapers or not even born, this movie lacks. However, getting out of the draft was a daily affair back in 1970. Even the most staunch supporters of "The War" admitted that Viet Nam or "Nam" was a one way ticket to mud, blood and gore.The direct method was to go to Canada which left some friends? and neighbors spitting mad. Having a child (no matter how or where) was VERY acceptable. The prevailing public feeling was that the chances of returning in one piece from 'Nam was not good.Many of the people that were very directly affected by Viet Nam, during that time period, were a mess. Their actions seemed disjointed and their lives lacked many of the characteristics of what we now call normal living. It was a time of such uncertainty, and day to day confrontations that life is fragile and gone too quickly. This movie, in part, represents that time in a story form.</p>
