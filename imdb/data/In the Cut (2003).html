<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the Cut just didn't do it for me.  Maybe Meg Ryan is trying to shed her "good girl" image, but all she managed to do for me was shed her "good movie" image. Profanity in movies has never offended me, but the profanity in this movie just seems to be thrown in for its supposed shock value. This movie appears to be nothing more than a vehicle for Ryan to get naked and Ruffalo to talk like some prank-calling pervert at a payphone.  The plot was, well--absent.  The characters were despicable and repugnant and the atmosphere was grimy and foul, like a back alley crack house.  I had only one persistent emotion during this entire ordeal, and that was escape. The movie was misery from the opening credits, and couldn't wait for it to end.</p>
