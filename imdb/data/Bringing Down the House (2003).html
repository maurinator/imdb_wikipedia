<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a divorced workaholic lawyer, who spends his time working and in a chat room for lawyers in Internet, where he meets the young lawyer Charlene Morton. He has a teenager daughter and a son, and misses his wife Kate (Jean Smart). One day, he schedules a dinner at his home with the pretty and blonde Charlene, of whom he has a picture only. When he opens his door, he sees that Charlene is indeed a huge Afro-American woman (Queen Latifah), who was in jail and wants him to defend her, claiming that she is innocent. Charlene forces Peter to lodge and defend her, and from this moment on, his life turns upside-down. This movie is a very funny comedy, with many good moments. For example, when his teenager daughter trusts on him and decides to tell him other hidden stories about her, it is hilarious. Or when Peter opens the door and sees Charlene for the first time. There are many other funny scenes. Of course there are also many clich√©s, this film is not a surrealistic art movie and certainly will not be indicated for an Oscar. But I laughed a lot with the situations created by Steve Martin, Queen Latifah, Eugene Levy and Joan Plowright. Highly recommended for laughing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'A Casa Caiu' ('The House is Down')</p>
