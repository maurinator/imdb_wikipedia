<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Strangely, I have this one in my library since the late 80's. And I realize only now that it's really a rare film. No one has commented it yet and it is on any lists on any dealers in the USA.What a shame.It's a strange, weird, abashed movie. But not disappointing one. A war movie about the Korean war - till here nothing new - and the "relationship" between a soldier - Payne - and a bottle of liquor he always carries with him. And since WW2, as I remember...Of course, through this "friend", and the "souvenirs" stuck to it, he lives everything again: friends, women, beautiful and difficult moments of his life. It's not a real actionner, but a rather solid drama.A very strange one. Like a TWILIGHT ZONE episode. And it seems, as far as I remember, that there was an episode around this topic. But I am not sure. Sorry.I hope this little movie will be aired again, for the happiness of gem searchers.And this was also an Allan Dwann film.</p>
