<h1>Nancy Goes to Rio (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A mother and daughter compete over the same singing role and, unbeknownst to each other, the same man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great production values highlight this musical comedy that revolves around a pair of misunderstandings that blossom to full effect.With her Debbie Reynolds looks and her operatic voice, Jane Powell is wonderful as 17-year-old Nancy Barklay, a budding actress. Her mother, Frances--also an actress--is played by Ann Sothern. The two of them are wonderful together. In fact the entire cast fits together nicely in this light-hearted story that deals with music more than romance. Barry Sullivan plays Paul Berten, the man who sort of comes between them. Louis Calhern is Frances' father, an old song and dance man himself. Carmen Miranda goes full fruit basket with a couple of catchy tunes. Hans Conreid is underused as the family butler.Technicolor brightens the screen and shows off some great sets, especially the family home in Rio. The wardrobe is striking.Jane Powell gets to display her classical credentials with a solo from La Boheme."Nancy Goes to Rio" is an enjoyable excursion designed to put a smile on the face of viewers. And it does just that.</p>
