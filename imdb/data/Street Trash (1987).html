<p>A liquor store owner sells alcoholic beverages to homeless people, unaware of what the bottles actually contain: toxic brew.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sure the acting is horrible, and there's about ten or twelve incoherent unrelated plots and the special effects look like some four dollar and thirty five cent props bought from Murray's Party Supplies but this an essential low budget schock insanity movie. Random thoughts that will run through your head when watching it include: wow, somebody actually took the time and effort to write out a screenplay for this garbage? and I wonder how many times they had to re do this entire nutty scene before the "actors" stopped cracking up at it's sheer insanity. This is definitely a hidden gem, a true jewel if your lucky enough to live near a video store that has a copy of it. Rent it!!!!!!! 10 out of 10.</p>
