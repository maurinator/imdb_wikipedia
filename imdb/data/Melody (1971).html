<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i was fortunate enough to play the part of peggy in this film, it was alan parkers first screenplay and david puttnams first film, i had previously worked with alan on several advertisments and continued to work with him after melody on a few more adverts, i count myself so very lucky to have appeared in alan and davids first big project, i am amazed that this film still has a big following 33 years later, my original vhs copy of melody broke many years ago, but i managed to track down a copy as well as a dvd, i had no idea it was readily available to buy in hongkong,japan, america and even argentina! since checking out the websites for melody/swalk i have been amazed by the wonderful emails sent to me from people all around the world, i would like to thank everybody who has taken time out to enter their comments and feelings etc and to wish everybody a very happy and healthy 2004  kay (nee skinner)</p>
