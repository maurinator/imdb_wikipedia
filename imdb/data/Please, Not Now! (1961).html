<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That's what the title means ...Nowadays was actually 1961.But BB was an important actress,because she created a brand new type of woman on the screen,not a bimbo as too many people think today.We cannot say the same of her ex-husband and director Vadim,with whom she made five films("Et Dieu cr√©a la femme" ,"Les bijoutiers du clair de lune" ," "le repos du guerrier" "Don Juan73" and this movie).None of this bad lot would deserve to be watched today,if it were not for BB ."La bride sur le cou" was first directed by Jean Aurel,who wrote the screenplay ,but Vadim finished and took the credit.This is a harmless comedy,with an occasional funny line.THe love and sympathy BB feels for animals emerge sometimes.An erotic dance is given the soft focus treatment,because of the censorship.Today it would not shock a ten-year-old.</p>
