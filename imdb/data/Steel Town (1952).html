<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If this film is nothing else, it is an excellent statement/commentary on a working class town in the 1950s. Great use of color for 1952, which was allegedly done to properly feature Ann Sheridan's red hair. Many scenes were filmed at the Kaiser steel plant in Fontana, CA. What the average viewer in the 21st century probably will not know is that the cars used in this movie were manufactured by the Kaiser-Frazer Motor corporation. Of all the aspects of this film, seeing these old cars, a very colorful 1951 Kaiser driven by Lund and a 1951 Henry J (also made by Kaiser) driven by Duff, was a real treat. Not much of a story but excellent social commentary on a period many look back on with rose colored glasses.</p>
