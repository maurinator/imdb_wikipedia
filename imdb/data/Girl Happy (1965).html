<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Because they were just the perfect match of that time, to perform a such movie. It's the best movie of Elvis, combining many styles of music and appropriate dance of those golden years of rock, shake, and twist. Shelley did her best youngness' show performance together with Elvis. The movie revealed also one of the best team of dance around the King, on that empty beach with bushes, while performing "Do the Clam" song. If Fort Lauderdale could keep the tracks of that year buildings and entertainment resorts, it might be another business around Elvis.Do not forget to review from time to time the King and Shelley. It's a very good entertainment when you've got tired and dance lack of desire.</p>
