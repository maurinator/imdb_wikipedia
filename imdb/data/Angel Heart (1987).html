<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry Angel has a new case, to find a man called Johnny Favourite. Except things aren't quite that simple and Johnny doesn't want to be found. Let's just say that amongst the period detail and beautiful scenery, it all gets really really nasty.</p>
<p>It's 1955. Small time New York City gumshoe Harry Angel is hired through a law firm by a mysterious man named Louis Cyphre. Cyphre tells Harry that choosing him as the private investigator for this case was by no accident despite Harry not knowing who Cyphre is or in turn Cyphre not directly stating why he chose Harry. The case is to locate a man by the name of Johnny Favorite, a popular singer before World War II, who served in the war and supposedly was institutionalized due to his injuries since, although Cyphre has not seen Favorite during that time. As Harry progresses through the case, he doesn't quite trust Cyphre as every step Harry takes leads to people angry about his questions and/or who want to beat him. Johnny's associates are highly populated by those into mysticism and particularly voodoo, which takes Harry to New Orleans. As Harry continues his investigation, one by one, the people he interviews turn up dead. Although Harry isn't sure if he wants to continue with the case, he does so if only to satisfy his own curiosity as to Johnny's whereabouts and why Cyphre wants to find him.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Harry Angel(Mickey Rourke) is a sleazy private detective in 1955 New York.  One day, Harry is approached by a mysterious lawyer named Louis Cyphre(Robert De Niro).  Louis also has unusually long fingernails and needs help in searching for a former client of his who disappeared mysteriously without ever paying him back.  So Harry begins his investigation which takes him from the dark alleys and streets of New York to the hot, musty bayous of Louisiana.  While there, he meets up with Epiphany Proudfoot(Lisa Bonet) who is a voodoo priestess and soon enough Harry becomes caught up in voodoo mysticism.This is the first movie directed by Alan Parker that I've seen and is also the movie that introduced me to Mickey Rourke.  The movie has a really dark atmosphere and I really like the heartbeat on the soundtrack that helps to build the tension.  "Angel Heart" ranks up there with those really twisted supernatural thrillers like "The Sixth Sense" and "Jacob's Ladder".  Why this movie hasn't gotten much attention over the last fourteen years I'll never know.  What really makes this movie good is probably its 1950s setting which gives "Angel Heart" some originality.  The film's ending just gives me the creeps because it just comes at you from out of no where and there is nothing that hints it.  Viewers should also be cautioned when watching "Angel Heart" because it is extremely bloody and then of course there is that love scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet which stirred up a little bit of controversy when it was first released back in 1987.  10/10</p>
