<h1>Sign 'o' the Times (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In front of a crowd at the Rotterdam Music Hall, Prince and his band perform 13 numbers, 11 of which are from his double album, "Sign 'o' the Times," and all but "Now's the Time" are his compositions. This is high energy stuff, with neon signs flashing above the stage, suggesting the honky-tonk district of a big city. Between a few of the numbers, there are vignettes of street life. Three women - Shiela E, Boni Boyer, and Cat - provide rhythmic, vocal, and physical pyrotechnics. Sheena Easton appears in a film within a film, her rock video "U Got the Look." In constant motion, never far from center stage, is Prince, Minnesota's charismatic pixy.</p>
<p>A concert film with theatrical staging, featuring live performances by Prince and his band.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The only reason I don't give this movie a 10, is that its not a "Perfect Film". On the other hand, it is The Best Concert Film Made to Date. PERIOD. It deserves to be seen on as big a screen as you can find and turned up LOUD. I was fortunate enough to see it in a theater. I had no idea of how remarkable a performer Prince is before I saw Sign 'o' the Times . All the previous reviews will give you a much more in depth analysis, individual artist's descriptions, etc. What I have to offer is a pure gut-level reaction: We were Blown Away. My friend went back to the theater the next night to see it again. It impressed me so much, I'm getting a copy for my own collection.</p>
