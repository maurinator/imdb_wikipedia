<h1>Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The good-hearted Harbour has spent his whole life trying to take care of his motherless and suicidal little brother, Wilbur. The brothers are inseparable. When in their thirties, they lose their father and inherit his second-hand bookshop. One day Alice enters the shop with her little daughter. Alice is a cleaning lady at the nearby hospital and she sells the books that the patients leave behind. The daughter Mary yearns for a home where the books don't always get sold. Harbour falls in love with Alice and soon all four of them are closely intertwined in each other's lives - and perhaps even deaths.</p>
<p>Harbour and his suicidal brother Wilbur inherit their father's used bookstore in their native Glasgow. Their lives become entangled with Alice and her daughter Mary after the two women visit the shop. Idealistic young Mary captures Wilbur's heart, and just may help save his life -- or help him find peace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really wanted to love this movie, as I love Anders Jensen's writing and all his directorial projects, but I felt let down by 'Wilbur'. Despite the great performances, I just couldn't connect with any of the characters. Wilbur's desperate need to end his life just didn't feel real to me, just faintly comedic. And, similarly, Harbour's illness just didn't strike me as the tragedy I felt it should. The editing seemed sloppy and the story rushed, with the effect that the narrative seemed jumpy and confusing. I couldn't help but wonder whether the film suffered from being very Danish in tone, but being delivered by a British cast. The humour seemed lost on them, just as the sadness seemed unconvincing. A pity as it seemed as if the original script was very interesting.</p>
