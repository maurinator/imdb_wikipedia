<h1>Peter Pan (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In stifling Edwardian London, Wendy Darling mesmerizes her brothers every night with bedtime tales of swordplay, swashbuckling, and the fearsome Captain Hook. But the children become the heroes of an even greater story, when Peter Pan flies into their nursery one night and leads them over moonlit rooftops through a galaxy of stars and to the lush jungles of Neverland. Wendy and her brothers join Peter and the Lost Boys in an exhilarating life--free of grown-up rules--while also facing the inevitable showdown with Hook and his bloodthirsty pirates.</p>
<p>The Darling family children receive a visit from Peter Pan, who takes them to Never Never Land where an ongoing war with the evil Pirate Captain Hook is taking place.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having seen the movie a few hours ago and the initial joy wearing off, this movie still leaves a pleasant taste in your mouth. This is Peter Pan as it should have been done years ago (although quite possibly couldn't have, effects wise). The movie is highly stylised, which works brilliantly, and very rarely has any cringe-worthy moments.The lead actors, both children, are wonderful. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter has a certain arrogance and cockiness about him that really works for the boy who never wants to grow up, and his chemistry with the actress playing Wendy is very palpable. The successfully manage to hold the movie on their own, though Jason Isaacs as Hook/Mr Darling is wonderful in his own right. Never over the top, as it could be so easy to do, but never forgetting that he's in a make believe land, full of mermaids, flying children, and hugely oversized alligators, one with a specific taste for his flesh.Overall this movie is a joy, not only for children but for adults alike. The style is unique, the effects are wonderful, and the plotline tight. Definitely highly recommended :)</p>
