<h1>Just This Once (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mark MacLene owes the IRS, the banks and others a lot of money. The problem is that his trust makes $1,000,000 a year, but he spends $150,000 every month. His trustee, Sam, uses the power of attorney and the spend thrift clause to hire frugal Lucille Duncan to manage Mark's finances. Presented with thousands of dollars for gifts and charges from the night before, she immediately cancels his charge accounts and returns as many gifts as she can. Then she puts Mark on a allowance of $50 a week, which upsets him even more. To get rid of Lucy, Mark moves in with her and makes sure that her boyfriend Tom receives a huge raise. He thinks that Tom will now marry Lucy and he will be rid of her tight control.</p>
<p>Judge Sam Coulter presides over an appeals case where young attorney Lucy Duncan fights not just for the principle but for the measly and complete $35 to which she feels her client is entitled. She is so inclined since she, as a working girl who is trying to save enough money to get married to her fianc√© Tom Winters, knows the value of hard work in earning money, almost to the exclusion of all else. Because of her bulldog nature, Judge Coulter hires her to administer the spendthrift clause of the trust of Mark MacLene IV, a wealthy but irresponsible playboy who owes $1.5 million to creditors and in back taxes, but who has no concept of managing money and thus who is on track to wipe out his entire trust in short order because of his extravagant spending habits. Mark welcomes the pretty Lucy into his life until he finds out what her role is. The more stringent Lucy becomes in managing Mark's money, the harder Mark pushes back using his name and influence to keep his extravagant lifestyle - the name and influence which Lucy can't take away - which makes Lucy even more stringent in managing his affairs, and so on. Both use reverse psychology in getting what they want. But in the process, they fall in love. The question becomes whether their love for each other can overcome their divergent views of how to live.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since Janet Leigh is one of my favorite movie stars from the past, I really enjoyed this 1952 film where she stars as Lucy Duncan, a lawyer who had to work her way through some rough times in order to become a lawyer. Lucy has a boyfriend who is a civil engineer and makes eight-five dollars a week and Lucy finds out she has a new client who is willing to pay her fifty dollars a week and between the two of their salaries, they would be able to get hitched. The client Lucy has is Judge Samuel Coulter, (Lewis Stone) who wants Lucy to have a sort of power of attorney over the trust fund of Mark Maclene IV who is very wealthy and simply spends his money like water on all kinds of gals, giving them jewelry, furs and the list goes on and on. Lucy takes control and takes back all the items that Mark purchased and makes him live on fifty dollars a week, plus 50 cents for lunch. Lucy even shows Mark an auto mat where he can get his lunch for a quarter and takes him on a Staten Island Ferry ride for only 5 cents one way. Janet Leigh was twenty-five when she made this picture and was recently married to Tony Curtis. Great film to view, Enjoy.</p>
