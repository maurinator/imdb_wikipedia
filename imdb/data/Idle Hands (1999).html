<h1>Idle Hands (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Seventeen year old slacker Anton Tobias wakes up one Halloween morning to discover that both of his parents have been turned into two headless Halloween decorations. After speaking to his equally irresponsible friends, Mick and Pnub, he discovers that his right hand has a blood-thirsty mind of its own and is hell-bent on wreaking havoc whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p>Anton would like very much to go about his daily routine of smoking weed, watching TV, and lusting after the girl across the street. The only thing stopping him is his demon-possessed right hand which seems determined to kill anyone it encounters. After dropping his parents and his best friends, the hand sets its sights on Molly, the punk rock girl of Anton's affection. Luckily for him, Pnub and Mick (his recently deceased buds) are back from below ground to help the problem get solved. Only they better get cracking because the hand is out for more than just a killing spree. If it gets its fingers on Molly before midnight on prom night, her soul is hell-bound.</p>
<p>A teenage slacker's right hand becomes possessed with murderous intent.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What more can I say about this movie? All I knew about it was that it had quite a few elements of teen comedy and that I've only seen the tail end of it a few times. Now that I finally saw the whole thing, it's now one of my favorites!It's a welcome change from most of the horror movies I've seen.Great music, great acting, and gorgeous women (Specifically speaking, Jessica Alba)... what more do you want?This is one of those movies that you can watch and understand it perfectly... whether or not you're stoned. 10 out of 10</p>
