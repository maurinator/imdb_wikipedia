<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house which ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the house's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, "Houses don't have memories," but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very sick. With the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective, George and Kathy face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children...</p>
<p>For George and Kathy Lutz, the Long Island colonial house on the river's edge seemed ideal: quaint, spacious and amazingly affordable. Of course, six brutal murders have taken place there just a year before, but houses don't have memories... or do they? Soon their dream house becomes a hellish nightmare, as walls begin to drip blood and satanic forces threaten to destroy them. Now after 28 days, the Lutz family must attempt to escape from the demonic inhabitants... or forfeit their lives.</p>
<p>Newlyweds move into a large house where a mass murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was but a timid lad of 14 when taken to a drive-in theater to see this incredibly effective horror film.There is no better monster to create a film around than the Devil himself.When Rod Steiger's character,Father Delaney is in the process of blessing the house,and was greeted by a resounding shout of "Get Out!",I almost took it literally,it was that effective.The Devil is indeed one unwelcome houseguest that is very hard to kick out,as you will see when you watch this film.James Brolin and Margo Kidder head a young family who are the new inhabitants of a home where brutal murders had taken place years before.Soon,strange happenings begin to haunt the family,as the house has trouble letting go of what had happened there.This movie is definitely in my top 10 horror films that I have seen,and if you enjoy being scared out of your wits,this film will do it for you.Give it a look!</p>
