<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I heard about this film version of Orwell's classic novel many years ago . In the Radio Times to celebrate the year of the setting did a large piece feature on the BBC TV adaptation from 1954 and the film version of 1956 starring Edmund O Brien and looked forward to seeing the BBC showing either version . The problem was that due to copyright issues by the Orwell estate there was no way either adaptation could be broadcast , instead the closest the BBC could do was broadcast a narrated version of the book for the Book For Bedtime slot In truth this version is hardly waiting for . There are some very good aspects to it . Best is the directing from Michael Anderson . I know Anderson is hated in some circles for " Having no love for the Sci-fi genre " but I've never had a problem . LOGAN'S RUN and THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES whilst not being classics of the genre are okay movies . Perhaps the problem might be that his films don't have too much of a futuristic look . Certainly he could thrown a massive spanner in the works by making everything look too futuristic which would have been a disaster . Here we see something recognisable as being both contemporary and futuristic which means nothing is too dated watching in 2012 The good points are however outweighed by the bad . Orwell's novel is unfilmable and only Nigel Kneale's teleplay despite being freely adapted does capture the feel and subtext of the original while this version doesn't . Instead the storytelling concentrates heavily on the romantic doomed love affair between Winston and Julia so much so it becomes more of a love story set in a communist tyranny rather than being about the failures of Marxism when it becomes hijacked by tyranny . It's certainly not a complex or sophisticated film and the ending has nothing in common with the novel The casting certainly doesn't help . You want an everyman type of actor playing the everyman character from the novel ? Well who worse than Edmund O Brien a very effective actor playing rough diamond types in film noir classics but hopelessly miscast here along with Jan Sterling who'd also be equally at home in a crime drama . Michael Redgrave is good enough in his role but gives an inferior performance if you've seen the 1954 BBC version with Andre Morell . It doesn't help that he's called O Connor which is another distraction as is the name change for Goldstein I can't say I was too disappointed by this film version . I went in not expecting much and came out of it having not seen much . Orwell was a writer who didn't make filmable novels and this is yet another film adaptation that once again proves it .</p>
