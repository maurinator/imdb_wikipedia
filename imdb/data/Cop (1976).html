<h1>Cop (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Haven is a rookie cop assigned to work the streets with a pair of veteran patrol officers, Cleaver and Bundy. Haven is also a super-strong robot. Cleaver knows Haven's secret, but Bundy doesn't, which causes a few complications. Despite the show's high concept, the leads normally battled ordinary criminals like drug dealers and mobsters rather than super-villains.</p>
<p>A veteran patrol officer gets an android for a partner.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Oddly, less than a year before this series (an action-drama), there was a short-lived zany comedy series about a cop with a robot partner called "Holmes & Yoyo".Decades ago, I saw an interview with famous (and often disgruntled) SciFi author Harlan Ellison, in which he said that the "Future Cop" series was ripped off of an idea for a series which he had submitted. Apparently, Ellison's proposed series, called "Big Mac", was about a very scientifically plausible police robot that was more along the lines of R2-D2. Yeah, that seems like quite a stretch from that to "Future Cop", but he won the lawsuit. I've also heard it called the "Brillo" case.</p>
