<p>Pasqualino, an Italian everyman, deserts the army during World War II. Germans capture him and send him to a prison camp, where he does just about anything to survive.

<p>The defense of honor, a strong value in Neapolitan society, and his effects on the life of everyman Pasquale Frafuso.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wish you could put this movie under the English title of Seven Beauties so it would be more accessible to people. This is one of the best movies ever made and more people should see it. I was in a state of awe from beginning to end. How could someone make a movie like this? It is hard for Americans to understand this kind of existence because we never have had to experience anything like it. Lina Wertmuller has made a movie about the human condition that our ancestors fought to protect us from having to face. If you want light-hearted entertainment, stay away, but if you want to see just what it took to live through the horror of war, you must see this movie.</p>
