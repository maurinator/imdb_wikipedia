<h1>Biggles: Adventures in Time (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One minute the New Yorker advertising expert Jim Ferguson is at a business party -- the next he finds himself way back in 1917 in a plane fight during World War I. Mr. Raymond explains to him that he has a time-twin, to whom he's relocated in space and time whenever one of them is in trouble. So he has to help his twin, biplane pilot Biggles, in his attempt to destroy a German super weapon, that could win their war. Of course it's hard for Jim to explain his sudden disappearances to his fiance, Debbie.</p>
<p>Daring British WWI fighter pilot James "Biggles" Bigglesworth and 1980s low-level business executive Jim Ferguson discover that they can time travel to each other's eras. They try to stop the Germans from changing the outcome of WWI.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the film and thought it was pure genious!Biggles is a star unto himself! The film is full of action and alittle comedy!I like the fact that Biggles was a real live person and some of the film was based on fact and not fiction. Ginger, Algie and Biggles were all pilots in the First World War and possably went on to see service in the Second!The film is a fantastic eighties fantasy,war adventure pact with a prefect plot!Good against Evil</p>
