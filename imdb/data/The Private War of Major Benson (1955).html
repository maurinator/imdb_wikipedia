<h1>The Private War of Major Benson (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Major noted for advancing with his mouth before thinking is given a choice: to be drummed out of the Army, or take command of and shape up the ROTC program at Sheridan Academy before it fails its next inspection. At Sheridan he encounters three hundred pre-teen cadets who range from rascally to adorable, and a female doctor who has just the right prescription for him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first of Heston's two comedies (The Pigeon That Took Rome followed in 1962) and the best of the pair.Understanding his gift perfectly, Heston chased a comedy role that didn't actually require him to be funny. The pay-off is this little film that has no room for self-indulgence or ego.The success of Benson led to Heston doing The Pigeon That Took Rome. That one isn't bad (and way ahead of some of the "comedies" that get greenlit today), but this one doesn't hit an off-key note.Far, FAR superior to the truly dire remake (Major Payne) with Damon Wayans.</p>
