<h1>The Great White Hype (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the champ's promoter, Rev. Sultan, decides something new is needed to boost the marketability of the boxing matches, he searches and finds the only man to ever beat the champ. The problem is that he isn't a boxer anymore and he's white. However, once Rev. Sultan convinces him to fight, he goes into heavy training while the confident champ takes it easy and falls out of shape.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There's something in this movie to offend EVERYBODY: those of African descent, those of Jewish descent, those of dumb white guy descent, fight fans, music fans, you name it! Its saving grace is that it's so damn funny. Sam Jackson has WAY too much fun as the Don King-like boxing promoter who engineers a championship match for his fighter, played by Damon Wayans. (No, Damon doesn't exactly look like a heavyweight, but he's not meant to.) Jamie Foxx is hilarious as the frantic manager of a legitimate heavyweight contender passed over for Peter Berg's dim bulb. Rocky Carroll -- who's so serious on the excellent THE AGENCY -- here shows his comedy chops. I love this movie! (8 out of 10)</p>
