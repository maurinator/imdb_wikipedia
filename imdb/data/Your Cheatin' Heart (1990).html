<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From Wikipedia: a comedy-drama series for bbc television set in the country music scene in Scotland.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Watched this John Byrne gem when it was broadcast on the BBC,enjoyed it but,like many others,was a bit mystified. I got a DVD of the series this Christmas (not saying where from,cough cough) watched it again and I'm still mystified!Seriously though,the script is excellent as is the acting,but I'm not sure how much of the dialogue will be understood by non-Scots.Their loss though.Many of the cast,Ken Stott especially.have gone on to bigger things.Although I am not really a fan of C&W,the music is generally very listen-able,Eddi Reader's singing stands out. About time the BEEB released this officially.</p>
