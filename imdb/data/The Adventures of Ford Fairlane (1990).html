<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ford "Mr. Rock n' Roll Detective" Fairlane is experiencing problems, and it's not with the opposite sex.

Another one of them is that all his employers that want him to find a girl named Zuzu Petals get killed. Why didn't he become a fisherman's detective instead? A must-see for Andrew Dice Clay fans.</p>
<p>A vulgar private detective is hired to find a missing groupie and is drawn into a mystery involving a series of murders tied to the music industry.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Andrew Dice Clay, now THERE was a man who was ahead of his time, If he came a decade or two later he would have been heralded as the acting equivalent of say, Eminem.. You know except with talent. OOOOH! Hey is this thing on?? Anyways this movie is greatness & one of my "guilty pleasures". So many quotable lines. So many great cameos.
