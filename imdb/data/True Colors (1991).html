<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Burton (John Cusack) and Tim Garrity (James Spader) are waiting for Peter's congressional election results. The movie flashes back to University of Virginia Law School where the two best friend first met in a fender bender. Tim is from a rich family and plans to pursue a career in justice. His girlfriend Diana (Imogen Stubbs), the daughter of Senator Stiles (Richard Widmark), breaks up with him. Peter is ambitious and amoral social climber coming from a poor background. He had an affair with Diana and even marries her. Despite that, Tim stays as Peter's best man. Peter's rise in politics involve mob-connected John Palmieri (Mandy Patinkin) putting him in direct conflict with Tim who joined the Justice Department.These are two of the best actors of their age. They do their utmost but the story unfolds with a series of plot points. Concentrating on Peter Burton could have made this an interesting dark movie. This has the feel of a Brat Pack movie trying to do politics although the guys bring it. This film is unable to build tension and lacks the intensity that it deserves.</p>
