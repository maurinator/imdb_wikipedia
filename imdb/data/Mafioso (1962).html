<h1>Mafioso (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Antonio is a jolly and precise guy working for an auto factory in northern Italy. He decides to take his wife and two daughters on vacation to Sicily, so that they can finally see his hometown and meet his family. He's excited to show them around and dispel many of their negative stereotypes about Sicilians. He even dispels stereotypes about the mafia, saying that being a mafioso as a teen amounted to just being a messenger boy. But as Antonio reconnects with his past in Sicily, he finds out that there are more sides to being a Sicilian than he remembers.</p>
<p>Antonio Badalamenti, a good-natured supervisor at the Fiat plant in Milan, is a native Sicilian who has lived in the North for a decade with his blonde wife and two beautiful daughters. Before leaving on a two week vacation back to his ancestral hometown, one of the plant managers tasks him to personally convey a mysterious gift to Don Vincenzo, the local godfather. Even though Nino's wife has misgivings about leaving the comforts of her comparatively luxurious life, she is unprepared for what she encounters. Marta undergoes culture shock when confronted by the poverty and comparatively crude customs of the provincial Sicilians, especially the Baladamenti family, who in turn view the refined blonde Northerner as a snobbish interloper. Bringing his family with him to pay respects to Don Vincenzo, the always obedient and affable Nino discovers the gift to be a beautifully jeweled heart pendant enigmatically inscribed with the names of of 9 deceased "friends" of the Mafioso. After the godfather's nephew Don Liborio reminds Nino of an oath of loyalty he took as an 18 year-old decades before, he becomes further indebted when the Don settles a controversial land transaction in favor of Nino's father. Feeling he has no choice, Nino agrees to honor his fealty by fulfilling a favor to the Don, a nightmarish favor which shakes Nino's safe, complacent world to its very core.</p>
<p>When a good-natured factory supervisor living in Milan with his Northern wife returns to his native Sicily, a decades' old oath forces him to fulfill a nightmarish obligation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just had the opportunity to see this film in a newly restored print of the Italian original. The story concerns a manager of an auto plant (played to perfection by Italian screen idol,Alberto Sordi) in Milan who takes his family to Sicily to meet his family & his old friends, when he finds himself involved in the local Mafia Don & his ner do well cronies. The screenplay was written by it's director (Alberto Lattuada), Raphel Alzcona & Marco Ferreri (some years before he raised eyebrows with his films 'The Grand Bufet' & 'The Last Woman'). Although the films use of black & white was quite striking, I kind of wished it had been shot in Technicolor (for the panoramic shots of Sicily & it's beautiful coastline). An overlooked gem that's well worth seeking out, if it's being screened in a proper cinema,but it won't lose much on DVD either.</p>
