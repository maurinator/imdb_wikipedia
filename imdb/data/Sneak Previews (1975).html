<h1>Sneak Previews (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One of the first widely popular film-review programs, this show gave reviews intended for everyday movie-goers, without trying to present an in-depth analysis of the filmmaker's 'artistic vision.' Popularized the "thumbs-up/thumbs-down" format of movie synopsis.</p>
<p>Two critics review films both old and new.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gene Siskel died this weekend and it brought back memories of the early show when it was on pbs. He and Ebert shattered the image of critics as uptight prigs in dated tuxes and helped explain what made a movie good or bad in ways we could all relate too. I have no idea how many hours of my life were spent with Gene Siskel but they were enjoyable and enlightening ones. Thank you Gene Siskel.</p>
