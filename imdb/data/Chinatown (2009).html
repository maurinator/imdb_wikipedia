<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The death of a Chinese young man, Jack Chao Lu, watches helplessly the killing of his Vietnamese girlfriend, Tam Sung, during a Chinatown's parade. Jack's father, did not condone the mixing of his sons to a girl he considered not worthy of her son's heritage. Being both from Chinese backgrounds, it seemed odd, but certain cultures have their own prejudices against those not perceived to be of a pure ethnicity, as was the case of the girl that came from Vietnam.The gangs that extort money for protection of the different businesses are ruthless in the way they take care of those who cross them. Jack realizes his father is victimized by Bo-Lin Chen, the local strong man who comes to 'sell' orange trees for steep prices. Jack Chao, who considers himself more Americanized than his parents, and his own brother, pays with his own death because of it.When the Cold Case team becomes involved in the mystery, it brings back a lot of memories to John Stillman, who was also in the original investigation. The police was hampered by the community's own prejudices against any intervention from an outside group. A retired detective that also worked in the case knows a lot more than he owns up to.Lilly Rush, having an affair with Eddie Saccardo, discovers something in his apartment. In a shoe box, she finds a stash of drugs; she feels betrayed and vulnerable. At the same time, she can't do anything to attract unduly attention from Eddie, but she realizes he is living dangerously. They spent an evening together that evolves into a whole night at the shore. Eddie presents her with an expensive bracelet, which she is reluctant to accept because what she has learned earlier.The conclusion of this case depends in bringing back the detective that was part of the original investigation, as well as an unexpected member of the Ling Lu family, who knows a lot more about the brutal murder of the young man and his beloved girl.David Von Anchen directed the screenplay written by Alicia Kirk. A complex case for the Cold Case unit that is solved thanks to the tenacity of the detectives involved. The regulars, specially Kathryn Morris, do a fine job doing what they do best. Among the guests we can single out Bobby Cannavale, Kemp Lee, Tzi Ma, and Robin Shou, who do a splendid job for Mr. Von Anchen.</p>
