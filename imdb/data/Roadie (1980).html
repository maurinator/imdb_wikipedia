<h1>Roadie (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Down-home Texas boy Travis W. Redfish falls hard for Lola Bouilliabase, a glitter-spangled groupie determined to lose her virginity to Alice Cooper. Hoping to woo her, Travis signs with a traveling rock band and soon finds himself celebrated as the greatest roadie of all time! Between concerts, Travis uses his wits to make sure that the show goes on, no matter where, no matter what. This does not take long for Travis to realize that, compared to the great rock circus, there's no place like home. However, Lola's date with destiny (and Cooper) to become the greatest groupie of all time looms. Can true love survive rock 'n' roll?</p>
<p>A young Texas good ol' boy has a knack with electronic equipment, and that talent gets him a job as a roadie with a raucous traveling rock-and-roll show.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a rock 'n roll fan; have been since I was young.  I'm also a fan of Meatloaf; for about the same amount of time; so I was surprised to find this on the shelves of my local video store.The story is simple, a handyman meets the woman of his dreams who just so happens to be in love with Alice Cooper.  Meatloaf is very convincing as the country hick (yes COUNTRY HICK) engineering genius named Redfish and while Kaki Hunter tries to pull off the excited groupie routine, she's mostly annoying.For those of you who didn't know it, Art Carney is in this movie as Redfish's father, Corpus Redfish.  He is, as always, excellent in his role as a grouchy junk yard owner.The movie has many memorable (and unfortunately, period) cameos in it by Blondie, Roy Orbison and, of course, Alice Cooper.  Cooper actually shines as a rock star and has a very interesting manner; half manager/half psycho.I recommend this movie simply because it's a total shock.  Everyone delivers solid performances and, yes, Meatloaf can act.</p>
