<h1>Monsoon Wedding (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A story set in the modern upper-middle class of India, where telecommunications and a western lifestyle mix with old traditions, like the arranged wedding young Aditi accepts when she ends the affair with a married TV producer. The groom is an Indian living in Texas, and all relatives from both families, some from distant places like Australia, come to New Delhi during the monsoon season to attend the wedding. The four-day arrangements and celebrations will see clumsy organization, family parties and drama, dangers to the happy end of the wedding, lots of music and even a new romance for the wedding planner Dubey with the housemaid Alice...</p>
<p>There is excitement in the Delhi-based Verma family, as their daughter, Aditi, is about to get married to Hemant Rai, who is settled in Houston, USA. Lalit, Aditi's dad is busy giving a piece of his mind to a slacker wedding contractor, P.K. Dubey, who is running far behind schedule. His niece, Ria, is contemplating going to the USA to take up a profession; His wife, Pimmi, is busy smoking in the sly in the bathroom; And then the family and guests begin to arrive, from all over India, USA and Australia. The engagement ceremony is celebrated with great pomp and ceremony, and after that everybody retires to get some much needed sleep - everyone except the bride to-be - she is off to meet her lover, a TV Producer, not knowing that her visit at this late hour - is going to change her life forever.</p>
<p>Lalit Verma is a father, who is trying to organize an enormous, chaotic, and expensive wedding for his daughter, for whom he has arranged a marriage with a man she has known for only a few weeks. As so often happens in Mira Nair's beloved Punjabi culture, such a wedding means that, for one of the few times each generation, the whole family comes together from all corners of the globe. The bride, Aditi Verma, is nervous as she has been having an affair with her married ex-boss Vikram. Ria Verma is a cousin of the bride, was sexually abused by her uncle, Lalit's brother-in-law and the family's patriarch some years earlier, and finally speaks out to prevent his abuse of another young girl in the family, Aliyah. The wedding contractor PK Dubey falls in love with the family's maid, Alice. The bride's brother Varun, struggles with his father's disapproval of his longing to be a chef and angst at his inability to satisfy the stereotypes of conventional Indian masculine characteristics, possibly stemming from a struggle to come to terms with the boy's homosexuality. Ayesha the youngest marriageable relative of the bride, flirts with Aditi's cousin Rahul, who has just returned from Melbourne. This is all set within the two days preceding the wedding, predominantly at the Verma's house.</p>
<p>A stressed father, a bride-to-be with a secret, a smitten event planner, and relatives from around the world create much ado about the preparations for an arranged marriage in India.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just finished watching this beautiful film for the third time. The first time I saw it, I really liked it. The second time I got more out of it and I liked it even more. I just finished watching it with the director's commentary and I can honestly say I had no idea how good this film actually was! It was shot entirely on location, in just 30 days on a very low budget with a cast of 68 and only a handful of them were real actors! (A great deal of actors who were originally cast in this movie pulled out at the last minute or didn't even bother to show up) I guess that is the beauty of this movie though. Nair wanted to capture the essence of the Punjabi people in a true setting. She didn't want to go for the big elaborate sets where people spontaneously break out into a big song and dance number like you see in a lot of Bollywood movies. Nair wanted her characters to start singing because that is what they do. One of her comments compared Indians to the Irish as two cultures who love to use song. Throughout the whole movie, you get such a feeling of reality as if you are a voyeur who is really looking into these people's lives. They are lying naked and vulnerable before us. The character of Alice really stood out for me. Tilotama Shome's talent radiated from her and I found myself wondering what other films she had done. In Nair's commentary, the answer was revealed: ZERO. Shome was an English Literature student in Delhi University. The scene wear Alice is pretending to be a bride (like a child playing dress up) is so simple yet so powerful and beautiful. I have a few reviews stating that Tilotama was miscast as the maid. That she was to "elegant" and self aware to play such a character, however, that is exactly what Nair wanted in the character of Alice. Nair wanted to make a statement about people. Our beauty and presence comes from within our soul, not from our lot in life. Tilotama Shome can have a brilliant career ahead of her if she wants it. It is also worthwile to mention two more exceptionally powerful performances by Vijay Raaz (who was a struggling actor before this movie) as Dubey (Alice's love interest) and Shefali Shetty, as Ria (who has a dark secret that can ruin the binds of family) These three performances were outstanding, but the entire cast was incredible. This movie is definitely worth seeing, but I really have to recommend you watch it like I did - more than once. It really is worth it.</p>
