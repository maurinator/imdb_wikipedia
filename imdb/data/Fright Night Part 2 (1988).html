<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Title: Fright Night II (1988)Director: Tommy Lee WallaceStars: Roddy McDowel, William Ragsdale, Julie Carmen, Traci LinReview:Fright Night II the sequel to the smash 1985 film, is a good follow up to an already good film. Fright Night was excellent in paying homage to old vampire films, had charming and likable characters, and greeeat special make up fx. Its sequel is no less of a film.Tommy Lee Wallace did a great job doing this film. His no stranger to horror films, hes got such hits as Stephen Kings IT and Halloween III under his directorial belt, hes worked along side Jhon Carpenter on films like The Fog and Holloween so hes got the experience and the know how to make a decent horror movie and he shows he knows what we want to see. But we get lots more then just a vampire flick, we also get a zombie and a werewolf too.The story picks up where the first movie left off. Charlie is in college and is going to the shrink to try and make his horrible vampire filled past behind. His shrink actually convinces him that it was all mass hysteria, it never really happened. Peter Vincent is still doing his "Fright Night" TV show...only its ratings ain't so hot. In comes Regine, a mysterious performance artist who's trying to take the show away from Peter...and also seems to have an alternate agenda on her schedule.The story is basically a revenge story. Some of Jerry Dandridges pals decide they want to exact revenge on who ever killed him and therein lies our movie. Peter, Alex and Charlie get chased around by bloodthirsty vamps hungry for revenge. Seeing Peter and Charlie together again is so cool, they just make such an interesting pair, one a crazy cooky old fashioned movie star who believes in vampires, the other a young college student trying to leave his past behind. Once again Peter and Charlie are played with great vulnerability, they are not superheroes like maybe Blade or George Clooney, these are real people who are scared and afraid, in some really fucked up circumstances. The only really big difference in the characters on this one is Charlie, who seems a lot more mature and doesn't act so much like a nerdy teenager. Another change is the absence of Amy, but we quickly forget Amys childish behavior once we get a look at Alex (played by Traci Lin) Charlies new girlfriend. I don't think a great many people miss Amy and her crying and whining. Alex is a welcome and improved replacement for her. The special fx, are much like in the first one really good, and wont disappoint, though they are definitely toned down a bit. Where the first one was a make up fx tour de force this one brings the fx down a notch focusing more on character development and story. But just a bit mind you, we get some cool looking vampires and werewolves in this one, and they die in really innovative and interesting ways. Check out the scene int he bowling alley for some good gory fun. Then there's the comedy, much like the first one, the horror and comedy and mixed in a very subtle way. And its good because it is not over the top. For example we get a seen where the werewolf played by Jon Gries (who also played a werewolf on The Monster Squad), is trying to sneak a peek on some college girls room as they are changing their clothes. Also we get to see the vampires having some fun at the bowling alley in their own grisly way. The whole film builds up to a very interesting climax, showing us that true love does conquer all (even becoming a vampire) and once again showcasing some really cool vampire and werewolf deaths.My only setback is that I would have liked for Regine to show more of her vampire look. She looks really evil as a vampire but we only get a small glimpse of her in that state which sucked. Why the hell couldn't we see more of her? If I had been Tommy Lee Wallace I would have used those excellent make up fx just a tad more, at least in the finale. But like I said before, the film tones down on the special fx. This is only a minor set back on an other wise good film. An excellent sequel to an excellent film, its good enough for Fright Night fans not to be disappointed, and for every one else who just loves a good vampire film. Of course the first one was a hard movie to top, but trust me Fright Night II is fangtastic good time! Rating: 4 out of 5Ps. This flick has just been released by Artisan on a very crappy DVD with no extras, and its also fullscreen (YUCK!) but who cares, at least for those who are fans like me, you'll get to have this way cool flick on your DVD collection, finally!</p>
