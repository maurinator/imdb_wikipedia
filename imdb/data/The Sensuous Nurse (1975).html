<h1>The Sensuous Nurse (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As an aging widower begins suffering from heart trouble, his greedy heirs hope to speed him on his way by hiring a super-seductive nurse to get his pulse racing. Their plan backfires, though, as the young beauty begins to fall in love with the old man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good production, plot, directing and acting.  A superb vehicle for Ursula Andress, hired to induce a wealthy patriarch's corony by overdosing him with cleavage.  She winds up falling in love with him. Black humor handled well.  Not campy or dated.  Ironic ending.</p>
