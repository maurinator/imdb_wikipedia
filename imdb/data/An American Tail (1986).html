<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"An American Tail" was Don Bluth's second animated feature since leaving Disney, and, in my opinion, it is his best. It's got the most heart out of all of his movies. It's got the Oscar-nominated song "Somewhere Out There" and the main character of Fievel. This character just warms my heart and I can easily feel for him. Don Bluth has made only three very good animated features: this movie, "The Secret of NIMH", and "The Land Before Time". But "An American Tail" tops them both. No matter how predictable or sentimental the story is, I always get caught up in it. The sequel was good, but it was more like a fast-paced western comedy with some one-liners and such sight gags. The original is the better film in my opinion. Only complaint: one too many chase scenes with Fievel and other mice running from cats.</p>
