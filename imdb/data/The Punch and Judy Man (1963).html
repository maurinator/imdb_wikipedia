<h1>The Punch and Judy Man (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dark comedy about a seaside Punch and Judy man driven to distraction by his social climbing wife and his hatred for the snobbery of local government. He is persuaded to go to the Mayor's gala evening but it's all too much for him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As mentioned by someone else, this film has matured with age. I watched the Punch and Judy man because I was a Hancock fan. Sadly this is not classic Hancock but I don't think the movie was meant to be HANCOCK.The thing with Tony Hancock was that he was always trying to not be Tony Hancock, the trouble was he could never get away from being the Lad From East Cheam and he couldn't understand why. Which in the end led to him taking his own life.The movie itself feels like the Two sides of Hancock. The start is the Hancock he wanted to be, dramatic, and the end the Hancock we all knew and loved. the comic.</p>
