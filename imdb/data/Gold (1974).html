<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film while living in Geneva Switzerland in 1981, courtesy of a video cassette copy owned by British Lord Petersham, for whom I was housesitting. I was a lot younger then, thirty, and less discerning, but I was utterly enchanted by actress Susannah York, and have been ever since. It had the feel of a good James Bond adventure and I thought that actor Roger Moore was at his best, and in fact was better in this film then in any of his James Bond movies. I've never visited South Africa, but had studied the history of the country, and I enjoyed viewing the on-location scenes of the country. There are great scenes workers in the mines, as well as Zulu warriors in their regalia.</p>
