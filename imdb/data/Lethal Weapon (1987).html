<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If there's one movie that's an absolute an unquestionable action classic, it's without a moment of doubt "Lethal weapon". Who would have guessed back in 1987 that the same team would make a third sequel eleven years later? Still, the fact that "Lethal weapon" got sequels doesn't make it a miraculous movie. The fact that it means the same thing to "a buddy film" -genre than "Die hard" means to "one man saves the day from terrorists" genre makes it a special motion picture. It practically started the whole phenomenon as we know it today and just take a good look at all the dozens and dozens of buddy flicks that tries to imitate the mixture of vivid action and relaxing, splendid humor of "Lethal weapon". I have to admit that part of me would still like to see Riggs and Murtaugh together for the very last time. On the other hand Mel Gibson is already 46 years old and Danny Glover just turned 55 and he's definitely starting out to be "too old for this".</p>
