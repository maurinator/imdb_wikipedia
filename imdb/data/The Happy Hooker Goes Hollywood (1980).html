<h1>The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A madcap comedy about Xaviera's attempt to make a film in Hollywood based on her book. Getting mixed up with some of the biggest crooked producers in town, she beats them all at their own game, and makes the film without them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If your idea of fun is watching Adam West dance and simulate receiving oral sex, by all means, enjoy. Otherwise, this may very well be the worst movie I've seen made in the 80's. And I've seen SQUEEZE PLAY.Phil Silvers was in this, too. And Rob Petrie's boss.</p>
