<h1>Choices (1981)</h1>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Choices" is a horrible movie.  I say this because it is extremely boring. Not at any point was my attention held.  It seems that probably the only reason it's still available is the fact that Demi Moore is in it. Sometimes it might be fun to watch a bad film, but in this case, it's worth skipping altogether.</p>
