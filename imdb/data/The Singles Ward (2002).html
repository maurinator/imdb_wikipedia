<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Jonathan Jordan gets divorced he's thrust back into the world of being a single Mormon - a world who's ultimate goal is eternal marriage. Struggling to fit in, Jonathan decides to stop going to church only to be pursued by the members of the local singles ward who want to reactivate him. Nothing works until Jonathan falls for Cammie Giles, the ward activities director. Suddenly, going to church becomes much more appealing. But is he going for the right reasons?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While being single isn't exactly a crime in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints it's not something that is looked kindly upon in a religion that is looking to grow and fostered polygamy among its first couple of generations to achieve growth. Young Will Swenson is a divorced Mormon and in their philosophy if you fall off the bicycle you get back on and ride. To achieve marriage for all is what The Singles Ward is all about. It's the LDS social mixer and Swenson who's fallen away from the church goes reluctantly. Which is where he meets Connie Young and he kind of likes her, she likes him, but not the fact he's taken up gentile ways. Swenson is a performer and uses some satirical Mormon material in his stand up comedy routine. Stuff that George Carlin would have approved of, but not some sweet Mormon girl who is about to go on her mission. Young Mormon women do that, not as socially necessary as it is for Mormon males, still it is done.The Singles Ward probably has limited chance of success outside the LDS world. It's a pleasant enough romantic comedy about a Mormon boy and girl who find each other. The performers are both good and attractive and some note should go to Kirby Heybourne who has received some notice in the gentile world playing one of Swenson's friends.All I can say is it's just young Mormons in love.</p>
