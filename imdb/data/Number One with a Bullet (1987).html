<h2> Summaries </h2>

But his pragmatic & debonair partner, Frank, agrees with the entire rest of the police force: Nick is crazy. After a forced vacation, they go a little beyond the law to bust the crime boss & find the mole.</p>
<p>A pair of detectives is assigned to investigate a murder, and discover a trail of corruption and criminal activity that leads right back to their own police department.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nothing new, but this routine action comedy (Produced by Cannon's Golan Globus) with its buddy cops angle gives it plenty of life as Robert Carradine and Billy Dee Williams' natural chemistry strikes up some amusing dialogue exchanges and messy situations. It's on the cheapÂ… and it looks it, but this doesn't fault how enjoyable it happens to be. Cannon simply produces the goods; shattering action (shoot-outs -- one in drag and car / truck / air chases), a humorous script ("Old MacDonald had a shotgun"), likable good guys, scummy bad guys and a jazzy soundtrack.Nick Berzak (known as "Berserk" on the streets) along with his partner Frank Hazeltine are two L.A narcotic detectives, where Berzak believes the mayor of the community just also happens to be a big drug dealer despite everyone including his partner thinking otherwise. Berzak would go to any lengths to prove it, but their undercover operations always seemed to be foiled as if there's a mole in the department.Carradine plays his character with a rugged, if crazy edge (he even eats raw meat) while Williams is the opposite as the affably smooth partner (a real ladies man). However they both share a kooky sensibility and use unorthodox methods to get the job done. Some character dramas appear; Berzak's relationship with his ex-wife (Valerie Bertinelli) opens up another side, while the moments with his mother (Doris Roberts) was another comical inclusion. Barry Sattels made for the perfect slime ball. The support cast is good; Peter Graves, Mykelti Williamson, Bobby Di Cicco, Ray Girardin, Michael Goodwin and Jon Gries. Director Jack Smight visceral handling is sturdy, if at times clumsy but it moves at a comfortably steady clip and Gail Morgan Hickman's material has a real sense of irony and some running gags ("I'm just talking to myself sir").Stock, but entertaining 80s crime hokum."Don't say freeze. It only pisses them off."</p>
