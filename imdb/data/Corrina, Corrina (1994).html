Manny and Corrina's friendship delights Molly and enrages the other townspeople.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very endearing and heartwarming movie, I readily feel that it captures the delicate issue of mixed race relations during the 1950's with the right amount of poignancy and humor. Whoopi Goldberg is a delight and the whole cast works very well together. The film's setting had an added impact to me as it was filmed in my old neighborhood in Long Beach, California where i grew up and even though i grew up in the seventies i could easily identify with the events and characters. I fully recommend this as a film for the whole family.</p>
