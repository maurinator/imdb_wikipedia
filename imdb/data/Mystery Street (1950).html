<h1>Mystery Street (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vivian, a B-girl working at "The Grass Skirt," is being brushed off by her rich, married boyfriend. To confront him, she hijacks drunken customer Henry Shanway and his car from Boston to Cape Cod, where she strands Henry...and is never seen again. Months later, a skeleton is found (sans clothes or clues) on a lonely Cape Cod beach. Using the macabre expertise of Harvard forensic specialist Dr. McAdoo, Lt. Pete Morales must work back from bones to the victim's identity, history, and killer. Will he succeed in time to save an innocent suspect?</p>
<p>After a bird watcher on the beach in Cape Cod finds a skeleton on the beach, Lt. Peter Morales investigates. He and Det. Tim Sharkey deliver the remains to Dr. McAdoo at Harvard who specializes in forensics. There's not much else to go on beyond the bones: no clothes, no jewelry. McAdoo's examination reveals that the victim was a blond woman, around age 24 and that her body was dumped at the beach some three months ago. He can also estimate that she was 65 inches tall and from the shape of her foot, possibly a dancer. It leads them to Vivian Heldon, who disappeared at the right time and worked in a bar called the Grass Skirt. She was last seen leaving the bar with a drunken Henry Shanway. She took his car and dumped him on her way to visit a wayward boyfriend at the Cape. The police think they have their man in Shanway but McAdoo proves otherwise leading them to the real killer.</p>
<p>A human skeleton is found among the tall grass in the dunes on a Cape Cod beach. Barnstable Police Lieutenant Pete Moralas is leading the investigation, with his gut feeling being that the victim met with foul play. He is enlisting the services of Dr. McAdoo with the Legal Section of the Harvard Medical Department. Pete will use whatever forensic evidence Dr. McAdoo can uncover from the skeleton and the crime site, combined with regular police evidence, such as missing persons cases, to discover the victim's identity. With that evidence, they are able to determine that the victim is twenty-four year old Vivian Heldon, a Boston based nightclub dancer and bar girl. She had been reported missing four months earlier by Jackie Elcott, who was a neighbor in a rooming house owned and operated by Mrs. Smerrling. Jackie knew that Vivian, like herself, was all alone in the world, that being the reason Jackie felt compelled to look out for her. Dr. McAdoo also discovers that single Vivian was in the early stages of pregnancy when she died. Pete is able to track Vivian's movements on the night she was probably killed, including how she got out to Cape Cod from Boston. With that evidence, Pete is able to charge married Henry Shanway with the murder. Henry pleads his innocence, he admitting that he had met Vivian that evening at the bar where she worked, but that he was drunk, drowning his sorrows as his wife, Grace Shanway, was in the hospital just having miscarried. The evidence against Henry includes several eyewitnesses being able to identify him as being with Vivian that night, those people including the bartender where she worked, one of her casual friends, and an employee at a roadside diner in Cape Cod. Mrs. Smerrling also identified him as snooping around the rooming house immediately following. Pete has no choice but to charge him, even though there still is a nagging feeling that something is missing in the investigation. That something could be helped or hindered by one of the external parties working on his/her own agenda.</p>
<p>A small town policeman is assisted by a Harvard professor when the skeletal remains of a pregnant prostitute turn up on a Massachusetts beach.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all .... ELLLLLLLSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you're an Elsa Lanchester fan, you've got to see this movie. Although she is fourth in the billing, I'd say she's on screen second in amount of time only to Ricardo Montalban. And, she plays her character wonderfully: a scheming, not-so-nice landlady! ELSA ROCKS! Small aside: Thank goodness for Tivo's "wish list" feature and Turner Classic Movies! This movie came up during my Elsa Lanchester wish list search. Otherwise, I might never have seen it.OK, back to the movie: I recorded it because of Elsa, and for that reason only. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed the movie. It's a murder mystery, and Ricardo Montalban plays a young lieutenant trying to find the murderer. For 1950, I thought the detail of forensic information they went into was pretty good ... CSI fans might laugh or find it charmingly quaint, but I don't recall any other "noir" type of films that I've seen from this era talk about forensic details to the extent that this film does.I won't spoil the movie, but there are two scenes I'd like to comment on:1) While Ricardo Montalban is searching the office of a snobby Cape Cod blue blood, the blue blood (Mr. Harkley) says to him, "The Harkleys have been here since before this land became known as the United States. I can tell by your accent that you've been here less than one generation." (or words to that effect). RM shoots him a great look, then has a great parting shot when he leaves Mr. Harkley's office.2) VERY BRIEFLY, say 60 seconds at the most, Ricardo Montalban is working out by himself in a squash or handball court. A very yummy shot if, like me, you are only familiar with the older "Kahn" (Star Trek) or "Fantasy Island" Ricardo Montalban. Rrrrowwwr! Summary: Good movie. Good story. Good acting. ELLLLLSSSSSSAAAAAAA!!!!!!! I recommend seeing it if you can. (Sadly, I just checked Amazon and I don't see this movie as being available for sale on either DVD or VHS. Scan your Turner Classic Movie listings for this. I'm sure they'll play it again. Or plug it into your wish list if you have a Tivo. And if you don't have a Tivo then get one! (No, I'm not an employee of Tivo nor a shareholder! Just a huge Tivo fan!)) My rating = 8/10</p>
