<h1>Gidget Goes to Rome (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frances, now 17, is still in love with Moondoggy. She can persuade her parents to allow them a journey to Rome, together with two of her and two of his friends. However they have to take an adult with them, so they choose Peter's eccentric aunt. In Rome they get the beautiful guide Daniela, who's fascinating the guys and making especially Gidget jealous. She starts looking elsewhere herself.</p>
<p>Frances Lawrence and Jefferson Matthews - better known as Gidget and Moondoggie to their Malibu surfing friends - got pinned before Moondoggie went away to college two years ago. Now eighteen, Gidget is eventually able to convince her parents, Russ and Dorothy Lawrence, to let her vacation in Rome with her two friends Lucy and Libby, Moondoggie, and his two college friends Judge and Clay, all chaperoned by Judge's Aunt Albertina Blythe, before Gidget heads off to college herself in the fall. Gidget's parents may not have agreed if they knew the nature of Aunt Albertina, who feigns that this chaperoning is hard work while most of the time she takes off on her own for her own pleasures. Russ isn't totally trusting, despite Gidget wanting to show her independence, as he asks his Italian friend, magazine writer Paolo Cellini, the two who met during the war, to keep an eye on Gidget without letting her know that he asked him to do so, or that he is a friend of her father's. Paolo is able to fulfill this obligation by pretending to write a story on the goings-on of a typical young American tourist in Rome. Gidget and Moondoggie's fairytale reunion is threatened by what seems to be Moondoggie's attraction to their Italian guide, the young and beautiful Daniela, a college student herself. But Gidget may forget all about Moondoggie as she is swept off her feet by Paolo, not knowing that he is just being his suave Italian self, that he is working in part toward that obligation to her father, and that he is happily married with children.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie itself was ok, good scenery and all, but the acting wasn't exactly the best. Cindy Carol wasa terrible choice for gidget because of a lack of acting skills. If you look past the fact that her acting was lousy the movie is pretty good, the plot is slighlty more mature than the other gidget's. The scenery was great and so was the fashion show sequence. All in all, it wasn't that bad...</p>
