<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this black and white movie.  It stared Rod Steiger who comes across like Mr. Tony Soprano actually.  It was told in the tradition of a biography.  Capone was so violent yet a great businessman.  This movie is borderline FILM NOIR.  Mr. Capone, in the movie, starts out as a simple bouncer and them works his way up to the bossman of the Chicago Syndicate. He eventually was convicted on INCOME TAX evasion and sentenced to 11 years at THE ROCK.  The movie even takes us into THE ROCK where it shows Capone and how he loses his power.  What makes this movie really great is simply ROD's portrayal of Scarface.  He plays it very very well.  If I had to choose ANY GANGSTER movie from that subject matter, this is it.</p>
