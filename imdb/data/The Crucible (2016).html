<h1>The Crucible (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Crucible brings together a group of civilians with a former Green Beret and another Green Beret transitioning into the civilian world. They go together on a four-day hiking expedition in Utah to build a team and learn from each other. As the adventure progresses, we see how Naron uses his skills that he learned as a Green Beret and we learn about his trepidation of entering the business world. This journey shows us that the civilian-military gap isn't as wide as we think.</p>
