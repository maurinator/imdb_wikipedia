<h1>Mikey and Nicky (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nick is desperate, holed up in a cheap hotel, suffering from an ulcer and convinced that a local mobster wants him killed. He calls Mikey, his friend since childhood, but when Mikey arrives, Nick won't let him in: his moods swing. So begins a long night as Mike tries to take care of Nick, calm him down and get him out of town. Their sojourn - on foot and in a city bus - takes them to a bar, a club, toward a movie theater, to the cemetery where Nick's mom is buried, and to Nick's girlfriend's apartment. Tempers fray and the friendship is tested. Meanwhile, a hit man who's getting information from someone is indeed looking for Nick.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There's nothing wrong with a film being low-key, as a sense of subtlety can force the viewers to draw their own inferences from the story and ultimately walk away more affected, with both the films of John Cassavetes and Robert Altman being prime examples. However, sometimes a film can be too low-key and nuanced that it never particularly involves the audience. "Mikey and Nicky" unfortunately did that for me. Director Elaine May never seems able to decide exactly what she wants the film to be, with it's tone often wavering between quirky character study, buddy comedy, and crime thriller. All this would be fine, but unfortunately the two title characters are never particularly likable. Both of them are considerably misogynistic (oddly enough for a film from a female director) and entirely at fault for the situations present, with Nicky being rather psychotic. The film does have some interesting points to make on the subjects of loyalty, but none of the characters remain truthful to one another.Still, the film remains watchable for several reasons. It's definitely an interesting failure, as May tried, no matter how muddled the result, to craft something intelligent and different, so that should be respected no matter what. Unfortunately, as a director she seems far too derivative of Cassavetes, who stars. The main thing "Mikey and Nicky" has going for it is some great acting. Peter Falk and Cassavetes were both always compelling if often underrated leading men, and the supporting cast has some interesting choices (from Ned Beatty to William Hickey to Joyce Van Patten and even a young M. Emmet Walsh), even if they're often given little to do. Unfortunately, the film in the end lacks any real impact, making the whole venture seem rather pointless. (6/10)</p>
