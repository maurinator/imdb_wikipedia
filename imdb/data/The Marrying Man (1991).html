<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent romantic comedy. Kim Basinger is superb in the role of a cabaret singer. She is gorgeous, immediate, and really puts over a song. She radiates true star quality and the staging of the songs is stunning. The screenplay is fresh and funny, and creates a delightful artificial reality that is validated by the emotional truths it conveys. Alec Baldwin is appealing and natural. Elizabeth Shue is perfectly cast in a subsidiary role and delivers with conviction. Minuses are the supporting four Baldwin buddies and major lapses in mise en scene. A touching, funny, and underrated movie. If, like me, you've passed by the video box for eons, turned off by the Art Disco graphic design, take a deep breath and give it a try.</p>
