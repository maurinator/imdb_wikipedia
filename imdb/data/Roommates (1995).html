<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought that this was a decent movie, although the title was a bit misleading. I thought the movie was going to be about college roommates or those that met shortly after. I did notice that after seeing the movie that there were many similarities between how family members and standard roommates get along.I noted the trivial entourage of characters. I somewhat disagree with the above users outlook on Julian Moore. In comparison to other films, I found her performance to be somewhat lacking.I did however believe that the storyline was quite interesting. I have watched this movie and find it analogous to my roommates online network experience. I mean, did you know that there were places to find people like this. Not to knock these services and believe me, I had a genuinely good experience at www.roommatesonline.net. But I did notice that other places where you could find this type of roommate were lacking in selectivity.They always say that you can pick and choose your friends/acquaintances, but getting a roommate is often just the same as in this move - you can't quite pick them. And although you might not like them, it seems that the interesting ones keep coming back. I give this movie a 7/10 for effort and a decent storyline.</p>
