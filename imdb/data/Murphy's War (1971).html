<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I´ve happened to see this film quite a few times over the years. It´s still one of the best I´ve seen, thanks to the great acting from Peter O'Toole and the other cast too.The story itself, is maybe not too complex, but the excellent acting makes this one very different. Peters way of portraying someone totally consumed with the idea of revenge, is awesome.. and that accent of his is always nice :-)</p>
