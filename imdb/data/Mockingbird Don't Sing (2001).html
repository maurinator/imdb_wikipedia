<h1>Mockingbird Don't Sing (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On November 4, 1970 on The CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite reported on a true, horrific story that was about to rock the country. A 13-year-old girl was discovered in the small Los Angeles suburb of Arcadia who was still in diapers, barely able to walk and unable to speak. Kept in severe isolation by her parents with virtually no human contact for more than 10 years, she was confined to her bedroom, tied to her potty-chair and left to fend for herself. As Cronkite noted, it was one of the most horrendous cases of child abuse ever to surface. Much like an animal, the girl spat, sniffed and clawed. She had none of the traits or characteristics of conventional human behavior, nor could she comprehend such modern societal conveniences as silverware or bathroom etiquette. Her emotional development was practically non-existent, and she could not speak. With this heartbreaking story, the world was being introduced to a fragile, beautiful teenager who seemed and behaved like an infant, or Wild Child.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Genie has been a person of whom the first time I heard about her I was intrigued, in this however her name is changed to Katie. anyway I was a documentary on her and it was extremely powerful (10/10) but unfortunately it isn't here on IMDb. I wanted to see a movie being made on this and a few months ago on the wikipedia article I find a related article to this movie. When I knew what it was I only knew one thing - I was as excited as hell to see this movie, even though I know the ending I wanted to see it.One thing that also pushed me further is Harry Bromley Davenport's review that pretty much says "this movie is as accurate as you can get it" I then wanted to see this as much as possible.Once thinking this is an independent film you would think that there would be no faces that you would recognize - well Sean Young and Michael Lerner is in this movie.One question I would like to ask is why isn't Tarra Steele in anything else aside from this. Her performance as Katie was amazing, I would have thought that she would have been in other stuff - even if it is just small but after this she has been in nothing and this is her second movie.This paragraph is a response to Harry Bromely Davenport's review. In this I found a few things extremely accurate - and some stuff I didn't even know so that was really impressive - Harry - well done.My only complaint I have with this movie is the fact that sometimes Davenport demonises characters - I am fine with this in fiction films but in movies based on a true story it shouldn't happen. Although some characters in this movie are impossible to humanize (Wes - Katie's father - anyone?) so to some extent I might stick up for it.Now at the ending of the film may seem as something to say "Katie/Genie didn't have a good life" I have found out exactly what has happened to her. She is still in an institution - but from what I have heard - she isn't the same person as the ending of the movie, also - at least she is happy, that's all that matters after the pain that she went through, I hope this comforts people who want to know what happened.</p>
