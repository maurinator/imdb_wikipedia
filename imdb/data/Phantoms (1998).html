<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anyone who has read Dean Koontz's novel can appreciate what I have to say here.  The book was absolutely amazing.  I started it and absolutely could not put it down.  The suspense was killing me.  I read it over and over and...you get the idea.  I had no idea that a movie was made of it until I was REALLY bored with looking through the New-Releases at Blockbuster, trying to find a good horror flick.  Mind you, that is almost an impossible task these days.  Anyways, I started browsing the horror section when the word Phantoms jumped out at me.  This peaked my curiosity, so I picked it up and, sure enough, it was based on my favorite horror novel.  So, I rented it and was expecting something mind-blowing.  Well, that wasn't exactly what I got.  I got an EXTREMELY chopped up version of a great book where my favorite parts were cut.  I was so disappointed and decided that I hated the movie.  Later, a friend came over and had rented some movies.  Phantoms was in the mix.  He had never seen it, so I didn't want to ruin it for him by saying no.  So, I watched it again, and his reaction was pure excitement throughout the entire flick.  He loved it and wanted to watch it again. At this point, I was up for it just to see what HIS fuss was all about.  If I were in his shoes and had never read the novel (forgive me for saying that), I would have loved it too.  It really was good.  Word of advice:  DO NOT READ THE BOOK FIRST!  You will miss out on what could be a great horror movie experience for you.</p>
