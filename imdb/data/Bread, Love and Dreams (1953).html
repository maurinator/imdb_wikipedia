<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vittoria de Sica represents a median age officer appointed in a village of the Italy center. His love affair of a youth (Gina Lollobrigida) that in turn is become infatuated with a Carabinieri youth so shy that depose his love, forms a triangle passing the across of the whole film. About these characters forms a stage that represents magnificently a rural environment of the years 50. It has a very proper cross for a rural farce that it develops in a few rural perfect stages. Then is a film that leaves a very pleasant memory.The Gina Lollobrigida actress stands out in her rule of lively and vital girl. Competes and surpasses to the role of the commander ( Vittorio de Sica ). They stand out a rosary of characters magnificently represented, as the priest of the village, the female servant and the mother.A very proper story across for a rural farce</p>
