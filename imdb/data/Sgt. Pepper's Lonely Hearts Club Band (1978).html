<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Am I the only one who liked this movie?  After hearing nothing but bad press about it for years, I finally went out and saw it.  I thought it was one of the most fun flicks I'd seen in years.  All the characters were named after Beatles songs!  Starring Billy Shears (Peter Frampton) and the Hendersons (the Bee Gees) "were all there" as well, "Sgt. Pepper" featured Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina) as Billy's leading lady, and Mr. Mustard (Frank Howerd) was "such a mean old man."  Let's not forget Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (Dianne Steinberg), the Sun King (Alice Cooper), and Sgt. Pepper played by an old Beatles protege (Billy Preston).  The movie also depicted countless cover versions of Beatles songs, including Earth Wind & Fire's "Got to Get You Into My Life."  As the narrator, Mr. Kite (George Burns) even covered "Fixin' a Hole."  Critics of the movie should be so critical"when they're 64," let alone 82!  Sure, the plot wasn't worthy of a Kubrick screenplay, but what could be more accurate than explaining how corporatism is anathema to the fun of music, and how profound an impact the Beatles had on later artists.  Look for Dame Edna (Barry Humphries) in one of the many crowd scenes.  I have one final case for "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."  It had one of my favourite comedians (Steve Martin) singing one of my favourite Beatles songs (Maxwell's Silver Hammer).  I'm picking out a thermos for this movie!</p>
