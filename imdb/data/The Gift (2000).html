<h1>The Gift (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Jessica King goes missing, all eyes turn to Annabelle Wilson. Not as a murder suspect, but as a clairvoyant. Many of the towns folk go to Annabelle for help, and Jessica's fiancée, Wayne Collins, turns to Annabelle for possible guidance. Annabelle feels that she can't help, but this doesn't stop her from constantly getting visions of Jessica's fate.</p>
<p>Since factory laborer Wilson's death in an accident, their three sons depend on their mother, Annabelle 'Annie', the small-town's 'medium'. One of her regular clients is Valerie, the regularly beaten wife of loner farmer Donnie Barksdale, who even terrorizes small boys. When Jesscia King, society fiancé of popular gentleman school principal Wayne Collins, goes missing, Annie's premonitions still put the disbelieving sheriff Pearl Johnson on the trail which leads to dragging the corpse from Donnie's pond. Annie warns the prosecutor David Duncan that he's wrongly accused, but the jury convicts him. Later, dark secrets come to light, putting Annie and others in danger.</p>
<p>When a local woman disappears and the police can't seem to find any leads, her father turns to a poor young woman with psychic powers. Slowly she starts having visions of the woman chained and in a pond. Her visions lead to the body and the arrest of an abusive husband, but did he really do it?</p>
<p>In the bayous near Savannah lives Annie, a widow with three young sons and a gift: she's clairvoyant, supporting her family by reading cards. Not long after she's menaced by Donnie Barksdale, the abusive husband of a client, the sultry daughter of a prominent citizen (and fiancée of the school principal) goes missing. Annie leads the police to the woman's watery grave, Donnie's pond. At the trial and after, Annie must sort through an attack on her credibility and her gift, knowledge of the dead woman's affairs, her own attraction to the principal, and a separate crisis brought on by the mental illness of one of her neighbors. The visions won't quit either: what if Donnie is innocent?</p>
<p>Annie Wilson is a young widow with three children. She has a "gift" and to make ends meet she reads cards and tells people their future. When the daughter of the area's most prominent citizen disappears, Annie is called upon by the woman's anxious father and fiancé to assist the police. She manages to lead them to the lake where the girl's body is to be found and the police arrest Donnie Barksdale, known to both Annie and the police as an extremely violent man. Annie continues to receive clues even after Barksdale's arrest that leads her to believe someone else is responsible. In her final confrontation with the killer, she gets assistance from an unexpected source.</p>
<p>A woman with extrasensory perception is asked to help find a young woman who has disappeared.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Great acting, good writing and directing. Kept me engrossed from start to finish and that is saying a lot as not many movies hold my complete attention for that long. The acting of the whole ensemble was adequate but primaries especially did well with their roles. Keanu Reeves was very convincing as a backwoods wife beater and Hillary Swank played her part as the long suffering wife to a tee. Cate Blanchette was excellent as Annie Wilson, gave just the right touches to be realistic as I do know of several "seers" in real life and she captured their essence completely in my opinion.</p>
