<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Found injured by rancher Shep Horgan, Jubal Troop is offered a job as cowhand and soon gains Shep's trust. Mae Horgan, feeling she's been trapped into marriage with Shep, takes a shine to Jubal, although he is more interested in Naomi Hoktor who is travelling with a wagon train camped on Shep's land. Pinky, until now top hand and used to Mae's favours himself, doesn't think much of the new deal and trouble is inevitable.</p>
<p>A new foreman rejects the sexual advances of a frustrated rancher's wife, which leads to conflicts that could get him killed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This western is a rewarding film that has a great cast and the wonderful scenery of Wyoming's Grand Tetons. The tragic elements of high drama are here in this solid adult western where a wife's unhappiness and flawed values conspire to make an innocent man a fugitive from justice. Glenn Ford is the traditional western cowboy, a man of strength, toughness, and character who becomes a trusted ranch foreman while spurning the advances of an amorous but insecure married woman. Ernest Borgnine, Rod Steiger, and Charles Bronson are great in this film. Felicia Farr and Valerie French are also excellent in romantic angles as women with very different approaches to relationships with men. This western deserves greater popularity than it has received.</p>
