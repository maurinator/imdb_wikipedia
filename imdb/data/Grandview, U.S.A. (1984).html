<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even with a nice midwestern setting and a truly honest effort to make a film that most people could relate to on some level, this movie just comes up way short.  I just stopped caring about these characters about halfway in, and I spent the remainder of the film waiting for the predictable ending to take place.  It's not that this is a bad film, but I would call it generic, and it has a basic storyline that would be familiar to most movie-goers.  I'm quite certain that you can easily find a better film than this next time you're looking to kill some time with a movie.</p>
