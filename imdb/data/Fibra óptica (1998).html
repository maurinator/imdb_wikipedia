<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a Brazilian woman is falsely accused of killing a prominent Mexican politician, Marco, a young journalist, is hired by a stranger to discover the real motive of the crime. He is assisted by his photographer girlfriend María, and they are trapped in a web of torture, prostitution, corruption and power struggle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is from Francisco Athié, who also directed "Lolo", where I think he did a better job. Because "Fibra Optica" is strange, between experimental and art film, but even when I am getting tired of seeing the same faces over and over in almost every single Mexican movie or foreign movies shot in México (Roberto Sosa, Angelica Aragon, Pedro Armendariz Jr), I got distracted by the plot and thought this was somewhat original and interesting... I still stand Lumi, and her role here is a very nice one. I felt like I was in there, right in the middle of the killings, and then seeing how we uncover a huge net of corruption and lies. Athié proves that to make movies with a different ''feeling'' you just have to feel like doing them. Regardless of the budget. Where there's a will, there's a way...</p>
