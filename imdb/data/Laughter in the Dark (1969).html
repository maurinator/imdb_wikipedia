<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A married middle-aged art critic and 16-year-old Margot begin an affair and develop a troublesome mutually parasitic relationship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie version of Nabokov's pre-Lolita novel received mixed reviews when it was released in 1969. Among the movie's champions were Penelope Gilliatt of the New Yorker and Joseph Morgenstern, then writing for Newsweek. Richard Burton did not decline the male lead; he was fired at the start of the filming because of drunkeness. While his replacement, Nicol Williamson, was way too young for the part, Williamson gives an uncanny performance. He is matched by Anna Karina, who is excellent as the devious usherette who captivates him. This movie was one of her excursions into English-language cinema. "Laughter in the Dark" illustrates the phrase "Love is blind", both literally and figuratively. This movie should be made available on DVD and video, the better for movie lovers to admire its intelligence ,black humor and fine acting.</p>
