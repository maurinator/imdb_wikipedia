<h1>The Hireling (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young British woman suffering from depression over the loss of her husband develops an unusual relationship with her chauffeur.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Thoughtful study of the British class system, told from the perspective of one who essentially occupies its bowels, a chauffeur (Shaw) interacting with his employer (Miles), forming a close bond that threatens to transcend societal boundaries. Unfortunately for Shaw, his vulnerabilities mutate into misplaced fondness for Miles, a mentally crippled lady of standing whose only capable affections are for a recently returned war veteran (Egan).Slow moving, talky and ultimately (in my opinion) aimless - the climax is much anticipated, but the film ends quite abruptly and doesn't seem to me to do the narrative justice. Having not read the book, perhaps director Bridges was somewhat constrained by the manacles of the source material.Of the calibre that LP Hartley fans came to expect following "The Go Between" in 1971, "The Hireling" should appeal to anyone whose interested in the human drama, or perhaps, who admires the work of Shaw or Miles. Both are very realistic in their extremes, and of course, poignantly, in their common frailties. More narrative structure would have suited me better, even so, it's a sophisticated drama worth a look.</p>
