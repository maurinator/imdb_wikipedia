<p>OK, I admit it. I am a long time friend of the heir to the estate of the composer, Albert Hay Malotte, who wrote the score for this movie.Even if that were not true, I would still like to see this movie brought back and distributed on DVD.We may start by hounding the Disney Music Company. Maybe they can give us more information on the movie rights.WALT Disney MUSIC COMPANYC/O Disney MUSIC PUBLISHINGATTN: JULIE ENZER500 SO BUENA VISTA, MC 6173BURBANK , CA, 91521Tel. (818) 569-3241</p>
