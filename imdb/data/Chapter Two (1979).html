<h1>Chapter Two (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>George Schneider is an author whose wife had just died. His brother Leo gives him the number of Jennie Malone, and somehow they hit it off. And just when things are moving along, the memory of his first wife comes between them.</p>
<p>Forty-two year old novelist George Schneider is trying to recover from the death of his wife, Barbara. They were lovingly married to each other for twelve years. Concurrently, thirty-four year old actress Jennie MacLaine has just gotten a divorce from her husband, Gus. Wanting each to get on with their lives, George's brother Leo Schneider and Jennie's best friend Faye Medwick (the two who once dated) send George and Jennie respectively on a series of blind dates, which end up disastrously. So when Leo and Faye run into each other and suggest that George and Jennie go out, both George and Jennie are reluctant, thinking that this meeting will end up like the rest of their blind dates. However, both are pleasantly surprised with each other. After a two week whirlwind romance and courtship, George and Jennie decide to get married. Jennie in particular realizes that she is the one who has the potential of being hurt if George is not ready to move on without Barbara, especially as they honeymoon in the same resort where George and Barbara once vacationed, and as Jennie will move into the house that was once George and Barbara's.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In short, a classic example of an effort where the dialogue runs the film, not special effects, sex, or some other 'popular' innovation.  The repartee is bright, witty, and hilarious.  Reminds me of the Walter Matthau-Glenda Jackson films.The main characters' initial phone exchanges are phenomenal and hilarious. Later, the two supporting characters (played by Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper) have a meaningful exchange after being interrupted during a daytime tryst.  Great dialogue.  Well worth the two hour running time!! Enjoy.</p>
