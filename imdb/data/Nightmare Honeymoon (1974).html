<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Nightmare Honeymoon" tells the story of the honeymooning couple who decide to consummate their marriage in the woods.Unfortunately the couple witnesses a murder and when they try to run two rural killers knock the husband unconscious and rape the wife.After dealing with his wife's trauma the husband finally decides to find and kill rapists..."Nightmare Honeyoon" is pretty tame in comparison to Silverstein's "A Man Called Horse".The rape scene is off-screen and there is only a little bit of violence.The script lacks punch and tension too.Admittedly the climax is pretty tense and there is an aura of heart-breaking despair,so I wasn't completely disappointed.7 rapists out of 10.</p>
