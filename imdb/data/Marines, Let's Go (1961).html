<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>joebat23 was overly kind in his grading of this movie, it is absolutely terrible. The plot couldn't even be called sophomoric, the acting was atrocious and the reasoning of the characters was juvenile. Add to this the incredibly bad dialog and an "Intelligence department" that can't figure out what is going on when it should be painfully obvious and you have a movie that makes those Police Academy movies seem like high art worthy of a Nobel Prize.The only reason I can think of to watch this movie is that a relative is in it and even then I don't think you should lest you lose any regard you have for that relative.Oh, if you are expecting any even halfway decent battle scenes, forget it.</p>
