<h1>Hope and Glory (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A semi-autobiographical project by John Boorman about a nine year old boy called Bill as he grows up in London during the blitz of World War 2. For a young boy, this time in history was more of an adventure, a total upheaval of order, restrictions and discipline. The liberating effect of the war on the women left behind. And the joy when Hitler blows up your school.</p>
<p>Bill Rohan, a young boy living on the outskirts of London experiences the exhilaration of World War II, as seen through the eyes of director John Boorman, who also wrote and produced the autobiographical film. During this period, Bill learns about sex, death, love, hypocrisy, and the faults of adults as he prowls the ruins of bombed houses on Rosehill Avenue. His childlike father is off chasing patriotic dreams of glory from behind a military clerk's typewriter; his teenage sister runs wild; his mother can't cope; and everything in the end will eventually turn out all right.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Boorman is impossible to categorize.  From his spaced out ZARDOZ to DELIVERANCE to EXCALIBUR, this wildly ambitious director hasn't met a subject he's afraid to tackle.  Here, the film maker delves into his past, delivering the story of a boy growing up in WWII England.  Directed in a style that is nostalgic and innocent, HOPE AND GLORY displays a brighter side of human conflict.  Watching the picture, it is obvious Boorman approached this highly personal material with the utmost of care.  Nonetheless, if you're looking for a heavy drama, this is not the place.  Many scenes (if you're not in the mood for them) can become a bit difficult.  In other words, you're feeling as if you're watching someone's home movie.  However, this should not detract from the talent of a true cinematic master, John Boorman.  We love you, John Boy.  Give us more!</p>
