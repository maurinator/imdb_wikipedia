<h1>The Overcoat (1959)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Shinel" is adapted from Nikolai Gogol's story about Akaki Akakievich (literally translated, that comes out as "without evil without evil-son), who always has the worst luck in the world. Stuck in a dead-end job with an abusive boss and co-workers, nothing ever works out for him. His apartment looks like something out of a Jean-Paul Sartre play.This certainly is a good adaptation, although you may feel tempted to throw out "MST3K"-style comments at it, due to the movie's overstuffed sense of itself. I jokingly called the character an Arte Johnson lookalike, although it's only actor Rolan Bykov who looks like Arte Johnson. All in all, this is a good movie, with a real classic feeling of Russian fatalism.</p>
