<h1>Love's Labour's Lost (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The King of Navarre and his three companions swear a very public oath to study together and to renounce women for three years. Their honour is immediately put to the test by the arrival of the Princess of France and her three lovely companions. It's love at first sight for all concerned followed by the men's highly entertaining but hopeless efforts to disguise their feelings.</p>
<p>A Kenneth Branagh written-and-directed adaptation of the Shakespeare play. Set in WW2 for the movie, The King of Navarre and his three best friends have sworn off wine, women and song for three years, in the interests of studying. But then the beautiful princess of France, and her equally-lovely ladies-in-waiting arrive, and their oaths are quickly and sorely tested...</p>
<p>An update of the classic Shakespeare story, director Kenneth Branagh shot this movie like a classic 30s musical. The film tells the story of four best friends who swear off love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love the film. It is so pleasant! I've never saw anything particular interesting in the play, and the film has surprised me. A modernizing of some story is not always a good idea, but it works excellently in this case. Setting the story against the war makes it more touching and convincing to us.  And at the same time the movie is a light dynamic musical. Tunes, that were used, are unfamiliar to me, and I don't have the feel of nostalgia, described by some other reviewers here. Nevertheless, the music is good, I like singing and dancing in the film. Branagh does his best as Berowne, and so do others. I like the way they speak their text, so easy and natural. The movie is really enjoyable, it's entertaining and moving and funny. Kenneth Branagh has a rare talent for adapting Shakespeare, and I think his comedies are the best (Much Ado About Nothing is brilliant as well). I admire him both as the actor and the director. Wonder, what interesting thing he will produce next? Meanwhile, Love Labour's Lost is well worth seeing, and more then once.</p>
