<h1>Boulevard Nights (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kid brother Chuco (Danny De La Paz) is a sullen low-rider still caught up in the life. Despite their differences, their family bond is strong. But that bond is violently tested when rivals challenge Chuco's gang - and ignite a neighborhood war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the most underrated movies of all-time. The granddaddy of all "street-gang" movies. If your a fan of Colors, Boyz in the Hood, etc. you will see that this film trumps them all. This movie is under-appreciated because of the seclusive nature of the genre it explores. But if you have ever lived, experienced or known someone who was ever lost in the world of street life then you have to see this movie. Many can't relate to the emptiness of Chuco or the inner struggle of his older brother but these stories are ones that have played out for years and are still relevant today. Don't listen to any biased review of this movie, it is a jewel.</p>
