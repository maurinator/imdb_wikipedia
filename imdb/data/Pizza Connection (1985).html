<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First, let me say that I am surprised that no one has commented it yet, especially a movie starring Michele Placido who has an outstanding role, as a mafia lead assassin. Very difficult to believe for those who loved him in THE OCTOPUSS series, where he played an untouchable attorney fighting against mafia, I know, but that's damn true. In this movie, that I watched in the three hours TV length copy, you have plenty sub characters and plots, but that's easy to follow. A pure Italian story about mafia but also family and social realistic way of life in Italy. I would have perfectly imagined this as a mini series, not a movie, which it originally was. Placido plays a pizza restaurant owner from America who is a killer for the mafia. When he returns home in Sicily, he finds back his young brother who doesn't want to follow his elder's path, but who is in love with a fifteen years old girl whose own family forces to be a prostitute. So, Placido's young bro will asks his elder to interfere for the sake of the poor teen girl. And, guess what, Placido will help his brother by bringing him up to kill an attorney, the exact same role Placido had in THE OCTOPUSS series that made him a star all over the world, and not only in Italy. The rest is predictable but terrific, although we have already seen this before.</p>
