<h1>The Gorgon (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In early-twentieth-century middle-Europe, villagers are literally becoming petrified. Although the authorities try to hush the matter up, it is apparent that at the full moon, Megaera, a Gorgon, leaves her castle lair and anyone looking on her face is turned to stone. When this fate befalls a visitor, experts from the University of Leipzig arrive to try and get to the bottom of it all.</p>
<p>When his father Professor Jules Heitz and brother Bruno die under mysterious circumstances, Paul Heitz travels to a small town to determine what is going on. It's the early 1900s and he finds villagers who are wary of strangers and apparently live in fear, particularly when there is a full moon. He hears of the legend of Megaera, a Gorgon so hideous that to look at her will turn you to stone. Of particular interest to him are Dr. Namaroff and his attractive assistant Carla Hoffman. Namaroff is obviously hiding something and is very possessive of Carla, who suffers from blackouts and memory loss. With the help of his mentor, Professor Karl Meister, Paul tries to unlock the secrets around them.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, a Gorgon takes human form and terrorizes a small European village by turning its citizens to stone.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the mythological gorgons(Megeara) is haunting a small village, and everyone in the village literally turns their faces away from the sporadic murders that occur when the moon is full.  All this is discovered when a father of a dead man tries to protect his son's reputation, and is greeted with silence and hatred from the villagers.  In his quest to find the truth...he does...the stone-cold truth.  This is a fine Hammer film, not overly scary, but incredibly atmospheric with its swirling mists, huge cavernous palatial sets, and wonderful direction and casting.  Terence Fisher does a first-rate job showing us the conspiracy going on in this village.  Peter Cushing is the town's primary culprit of hiding the truth and gives his customary good performance.  The film, however, belongs to Lee, who play an eccentric, gruff scholar helping the other son of the newly killed father.  Lee is absurd yet brilliant in his caricature.   A fine addition to the Hammer cycle.</p>
