<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After Paul D. finds his old slave friend Sethe in Ohio and moves in with her and her daughter Denver, a strange girl comes along by the name of "Beloved". Sethe and Denver take her in and then strange things start to happen...</p>
<p>A couple allows a strange, autistic person to come in their house. She causes problems for the couple and reminds the woman of her previous daughter. Nonetheless, the couple takes her in and treats her well. Through Voodoo, she releases her spirits. Meanwhile, their remaining daughter tries to find work.</p>
<p>Slavery, brief freedom, and their lasting psychological presence. Some years after the Civil War, former slave Sethe lives with her grown daughter Denver outside Cincinnati. Sethe is stolid and hard working; Denver wants society. Paul D, a former slave who knew Sethe, happens on them and joins the farm and family, but not before the house rattles and pitches, as if spirits reject Paul D's coming. Next, inexplicably, a young woman about Denver's age arrives, behaving in childlike ways, speaking and walking awkwardly, calling herself "Beloved." Who she is, her effect on Sethe, and Paul D's responses propel Sethe into the past and Denver into a new maturity.</p>
<p>Based on the book by Toni Morrison, in which a slave is visited by the spirit of her deceased daughter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this amazing film at the theatre and was skeptical going in due to Oprah's campaigning for it so heavily but was blown away regardless--after watching it again I understand her pleas. This stunning story and its brilliant execution by an outstanding director, cast and crew was seen by far too few people. It should have swept the oscars and if I recall--was merely nominated for costume design the same year that literally no black actors, directors, or films were nominated in any of their categories. wow--a real eye opener on how little respect good art recieves even today--let alone artists of color. I'd like the opportunity to tell each and every member of the cast how astonished I was even hours later. A beautiful, rich, and generous film. An earnest thank you to everyone who helped get it made. Bravo and thank you!</p>
