<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a movie about four teenagers, Hawk (Furlong), Jam (Huntington), Lex (Andrews), and Trip (Debello). They plan on seeing Kiss, but Jam accidentally takes Trip's jacket home, with the tickets inside. While Jam is at school, his mom, a complete bible-maniac, finds the tickets and burns them. She proceeds to take Jam to a boarding school. The boys are bummed out, but they hear on the radio that the 10th caller who can give the real names of the band members gets 4 front row tickets and 4 backstage passes to the Kiss concert. Trip wins the contest, and off they go to rescue Jam, and head for Detroit.I won't go into what happens there. All I'm gonna tell you is, this movie is hilarious. Go watch it for a great time.</p>
