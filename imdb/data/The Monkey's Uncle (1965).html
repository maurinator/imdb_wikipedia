<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Midvale College is in fear of losing it's college football team. The players have grades lower than the norm. Judge Holmesby, the team's biggest fan, is at a loss for what to do. Enter Merlin Jones, a bright college student, and his nephew Stanley, an intelligent chimpanzee. The judge wants Merlin to create an "honest way to cheat". Merlin uses "sleep learning" to help the players pass their exams. This saves the college football program from being banished, but not for long...the college is tempted to receive a $1 million dollar check from a Mr. Astorbilt. The catch is though the college must get rid of football. Judge Holmesby finds Darius Green III, who will pay $10 million dollars to the college if they can get a man to fly under his own power. The task is in Merlin's hands again. Can Merlin win the day and save the football team?</p>
<p>College whiz-kid Merlin Jones concocts a method for teaching advanced information to a chimpanzee, then creates a flying machine of his own design, ultimately raising havoc on the campus.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cute Disney film - the title sequence with Annette Funicello and the Beach Boys (who seemed to me to be on the verge of cracking up laughing the whole time) is worthwhile in and of itself. Check out Dennis Wilson's "Funky Monkey" dance since he's not singing.Anyway, this is a breed of film I wish they still made - goofy but not really stupid, a cute teenager comedy with a little innocent flirtation here and there, some very pre-PC dialogue, and a monkey who disappears from middle 3/4 of the movie. Some continuity problems, but hey, if you're looking for great cinema you shouldn't be looking at a film called "The Monkey's Uncle".If you're into chimp films (and if so, I really don't want to hear about it) and you rented this one expecting to see a lot of monkey, you will be frustrated. On the other hand, if you think Annette Funicello was hot, this is your kinda flick. "Lost In Space" fans will also enjoy seeing Mark Goddard as the BMOC.Otherwise, it's a cute little film to watch with young kids or by yourself when you're busting out code at home at 3 AM and it's either "The Monkey's Uncle" or an infomercial.</p>
