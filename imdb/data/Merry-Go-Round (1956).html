<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm from Hungary like this masterpiece. Zoltán Fábri the famous director made an excellent work about the story how the hard working people of Hungary lived in the '50s. Mari Törőcsik is still one of our favorite and talented actress and her partner here, Imre Soós was maybe our best actor at the time. He died young, so I think we must be proud of his energetic acting what he shows us in this movie. The most known words of this year was: "Land marries land". This tells us everything about the life in the middle '50s in our country. The cinematography is wonderful, also the classic Hungarian folk music which we can listen all the time. Maybe nowdays this kind of movie is too slow, and most of the teenagers smiles when they see this. But it was true, and very sad. Life is much more easier in 2008. But our grandparents lived there, and it was not easy. I've loved them telling about the past much more than everything, life is sometimes too short! I hold them in reverence! So, let's go and see this movie because it's a real unique art of cinema!</p>
