<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very good Paul Newman about the effect that war has on people's lives as they try to cope with their loneliness due to separation.It was a great ensemble cast with Newman and Jean Simmons (Oscar nominations for The Happy Ending and Hamlet), Joan Fontaine (Oscar for Suspicion, and nominations for Rebecca and The Constant Nymph), Piper Laurie (Oscar nominations for Carrie, Children of a Lesser God, The Hustler), and Sandra Dee.For a 1957 film, it really took on issues such as infidelity and illegitimate children and the casualness of sex during wartime.Newman was great as the officer charged with investigating girls who soldiers wanted to marry and take back home. He played a character very familiar in his films - one that had a close relationship with the bottle.</p>
