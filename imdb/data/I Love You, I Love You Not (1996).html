<h1>I Love You, I Love You Not (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Prep school student Daisy and her European-born grandmother Nana share the sad stories of their lives: Daisy tells Nana of her romance with young Ethan and problems in school because she's Jewish; and Nana tells of her young years under Nazis when she was sent to ghetto and then to concentration camp.</p>
<p>English-raised young gentleman Ethan is his New York prep school's lacrosse captain and girls' dream prince. Yet he takes a romantic interest in Daisy, the silly-shy social misfit, whose rare only hobby is reading, while confiding in and relaxing only with her 'nana' (grandma), a Nazi concentration camp surviver. However Ethan's platonic romance stage patience runs out and Daisy can't cope with insensitive pranks at school.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had to watch this movies twice. The first viewing left me a bit off kilter, a bit confused - as to how I felt about the film (the performances etc..) and the story. What I have decided after watching it over: This story is unique, nice. I felt the 3 main roles where well given. Claire Danes is the classic thoughtful and misunderstood child [My so called Life leading the way for teenage 'angst' series; Juliet - in Romeo and Juliet]. She pulls off the dreamy look. Jude Law, a fitting choice for Daisy's shy affections as her 'perfect' guy. The rest of the cast? Gone. Scratch all of them. I felt James Van Der Beek was totally unconvincing as a taunter/verbal bully (?). There were definitely angles in the film that needed work - particularly Ethan's character, and his interaction with his friends. If you try and come to some conclusion about them - you draw a blank. An intended one? I don't know. As well as Daisy's home life needed work. I can't decide whether it is left out on purpose or not.The directing, for me, was what ultimately let the story down rather than enhancing it. No lingering shots, no closeups where there should have been, particularly during Ethan and Daisy's interaction. It's hard to explain, but the shot's didn't work. Didn't create the feeling the movie needed to work.And this is a story that deserves to work.</p>
