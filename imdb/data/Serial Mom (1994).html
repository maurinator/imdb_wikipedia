<h1>Serial Mom (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A picture perfect middle class family is shocked when they find out that one of their neighbors is receiving obscene phone calls. The mom takes slights against her family very personally, and it turns out she is indeed the one harassing the neighbor. As other slights befall her beloved family, the body count begins to increase, and the police get closer to the truth, threatening the family's picture perfect world.</p>
<p>The Sutphins - dentist father Eugene, housewife mother Beverly, and late teen children, boy-crazy and flea market aficionado Misty, and horror movie fan Chip - are a stereotypical suburban family living in Baltimore. Beverly in particular is seen as being "perfect" in her quest to be just like the television mothers of the late 1950s. In that perfection, Beverly does and will not tolerate anything against her sensibilities, especially if it affects her or her family, and will take whatever measure to ensure people adhere to that sensibility... or else. Slowly, evidence mounts that Beverly is the perpetrator of obscene telephone calls to neighbor Dottie Hinkle, and the murders of several people in their neighborhood who have crossed their family in some form or another. Beverly laughs off such suggestions, but even her family members end up believing she is guilty of all the murders, with possibly more to come. Those accusations end up being not an issue to most in the Sutphin family, who use their fifteen minutes of fame to their advantage. Even Beverly believes that she can clear herself of all charges despite the overwhelming evidence against her.</p>
<p>A sweet mother takes a little too much at heart for the defense of her family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Serial Mom has long been one of my favourite movies. John Waters once again demonstrates his unfailing ability to tap into our fear of the gross and disgusting, and, perversely, help us to face our fears - we may know someone who picks his nose, but Waters gives us an obnoxious woman who lets her dog lick her feet clean after a shopping trip. Maybe your mother caught you jacking off when you were younger, but Waters brings a whole new dimension of toe-curling embarrassment to the scenario in the brilliant sequence where Scotty 'enjoys' (ahem!) a Chesty Morgan video. Waters also throws in close-ups of people eating noisily, a dentist's drill in action, a messy impaling (made hilarious by Kathleen Turner's flawless performance), an ankle-nibbling rat, signed photographs of Charles Manson and Richard Speck, respectable middle-class housewives swearing like construction workers, an all-female rock band called Camel Lips and a Pee-Wee Herman doll - "still in the box"! All this would mean nothing if the film wasn't incredibly funny, and thankfully, it is. In fact, it's one of the most subversive and inventive comedies ever to come out of a mainstream studio, and you'll be quoting the dialogue for weeks to come. And in case you think it's improper to laugh at serial killers, consider this - how often have you wanted to blow away an irritating gum chewer, a teacher who gave you bad grades, a careless driver, whoever stole your last boy or girlfriend, or pretty much anyone who got on your nerves? Serial Mom is the perfect escape valve for all those negative emotions, and is the perfect film to unwind with at the end of a stressful day."Are those PUSSYwillows?"</p>
