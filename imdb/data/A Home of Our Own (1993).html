<h1>A Home of Our Own (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story begins in Los Angeles when Frances Lacey (Kathy Bates) takes her six children and drives north to find a home of their own away from the bad influences of the big city.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As usual, Kathy Bates is outstanding in her performance.There aren't many movies that get to me emotionally, but this one sure did. I found myself identifying with more than one character: As a single mother, it wasn't hard at all to relate to Frances' struggles. As a former willful but loving teenager, I sympathized a lot with Shane, too.I felt myself sharing the family's joys, struggles and disappointments, and learned a few things along the way. Sometimes it's true that pride goeth before a fall.A very believable plot and great acting throughout, this is a must-see movie.</p>
