<h1>Ground Zero (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A second generation cameraman in Australia finds evidence that his father had filmed a nuclear test that allowed aboriginies to be exposed to and killed by radiation. He begins a search for a secret that if true, his government has already killed people to keep quiet.</p>
<p>Harvey Denton is just a good payed marketing cinematographer as one day some film material of his dead father is stolen from his flat. A.S.I.O., the australian security agency, begins to overshadow him. Denton realizes that there has to be a connection between his father's film material and the just begun inquiry about British nuclear tests back in the fifties in Australia. Is it true that the aborigines and military personal were intentionally exposed to nuclear radiation? All Denton knows is that his father filmed those tests with governmental commission and died while swimming in the ocean. At least that is the official ground...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While Ground Zero moved rather slowly at some points, the overall tone of the feature brought out a natural suspense that was both unique and different. While we Americans get caught up in the nuclear history of our own country, this film brought about a new perspective, albeit a darker and more sinister one.Colin Friels had an exceptional performance in this movie, which few Americans seem to care about watching considering the low returns. The ending was also rather surprising, just when you felt the story had ended and everything was for naught. This is one of those forgotten eighties films that I'll be sure to remember.</p>
