<h1>You Can't Run Away from It (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ellen (June Allyson) is kidnapped by father (Charles Bickford) after she ran off and got married to someone he thinks is a gold digger. She escapes and starts an adventurous trip back to Houston to be with her husband. Her Father hires a private investigator to stop her. On the bus to Houston, a newspaper man (Jack Lemmon) figures out who she is. Instead of cashing in on the big story and the reward money he falls in love with her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Evidently someone decided that since they had Technicolor available they could remake It Happened One Night. June Allyson, who was 39 when it was made, is dreadfully miscast as a rich brat who runs away from her father. Jack Lemmon tries his best to make it work, but even he must have cringed when singing the lame musical sequences. The black and white of the original mirrored the gloomy darkness of the Great Depression, and the rich brat's handing the last of their money to a hungry woman was a big turning point of the whole movie; none of that here. When will Hollywood producers learn that you can't remake perfection?</p>
