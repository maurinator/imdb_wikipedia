<h1>Coming Home (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sally Bender is the wife of a Captain in the United States Marine Corps. He is sent over to Vietnam, and Sally is alone. With nothing else to do, she decides to volunteer at a local veteran's hospital, where she meets Luke, who went to high school with Sally. Luke was wounded and is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. When Sally begins to fall in love with Luke, she has to make a crucial decision about her life.</p>
<p>It's 1968. US Marine Corps Captain Bob Hyde and his wife, Sally Hyde née Bender, have traditional conservative views. Theoretically, they understand that Bob's current role in life is to fight and kill for his country in Vietnam. When Bob is eventually sent to Vietnam and into active combat, Sally, who has never been alone in her life, has to figure out how to survive without Bob. On the advice of Vi Munson, the girlfriend of Bob's colleague Sergeant Dink Mobley, who too was shipped to Vietnam, Sally volunteers at the local VA hospital where Vi works. There, Sally's view of life and the war changes as she encounters the many injured veterans who have been emotionally scarred by the war. One of those vets is Sergeant Luke Martin, now a paraplegic who happens to be an acquaintance of Sally's from high school. Luke is now an angry and sullen man due to his experience in Vietnam. Despite Sally's love for Bob never being in question, Luke and Sally begin a relationship based on their current needs, and in the process they begin to look at life a little differently. Their relationship and friendship is put to the test when Bob arrives back from Vietnam earlier than expected, and whose own experience there makes his transition back to life in the United States a difficult one.</p>
<p>Sally Hyde is borrowing. Her husband Bob has gone to the Vietnam War. She becomes a volunteer in a veteran's hospital where Violet, her friend, works too. In hospital she meets an old friend, Luke Martin. Like Bob, Luke had gone to Nam but he came back paraplegic. Love between Luke and Sally grow and she discovers the orgasm. After the suicide of Violet's Brother (another veteran who came back mad) Luke has only one obsession: do anything to stop the sending of young guys to war...</p>
<p>A woman whose husband is fighting in Vietnam falls in love with another man who suffered a paralyzing combat injury there.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hal Ashby's film shares many of the characteristics of the other big Vietnam film of 1978, "The Deer Hunter." Both are passionate and essentially incoherent in their view of the war As Ashby and screenplay writers see it, most American soldiers who experienced the war came back mentally and/or physically ravaged An introductory pool table conversation among several disabled vets establishes the ground rules Anyone who defends the war for any reason is wrong Cut to enthusiastic Marine Capt. Bob Hyde (Bruce Dern) and his naive wife Sally (Jane Fonda) in the Officer's Club It is 1968 A military campaign conducted by forces of the Viet Cong has just started and Capt. Hyde is looking forward to his tour of duty in Vietnam... As a dedicated military officer, he sees it primarily as an opportunity for progress As soon as he leaves, Sally is forced to find housing off the base and moves into a new apartment by the beach with another Marine wifethe bohemian Vi Munson (Penelope Milford), whose traumatized brother Bill (Robert Carradine) is a patient at the local Veteran's Hospital Physically, Bill is fine, but "they sent him back without an ignition," Vi says Lonely and looking for something to do, Sally volunteers at the hospital and runs across embittered cripple Luke Martin (Jon Voight). They soon discover that they went to the same high school, where he was the star quarterback and she was a cheerleaderNow, paralyzed from the waist down Luke is subject to furious, self-pitying rages, understandable but still unpleasant and offensive Sally externalizes his troubles, his scars, and his frustrationsAnd through Luke's eyes, Sally's absolute outlook on life starts to change They soon become fairly close turning their friendship into a torrid affair At the same time, Sally's husband was away discovering the horrors of the war There was a particular chemistry between Fonda and Voight which gave the film a certain magic</p>
