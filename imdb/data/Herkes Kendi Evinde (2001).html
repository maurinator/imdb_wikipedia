<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even though this film is the first film of the director Semih Kaplanoglu he is very successful indeed. He has a way of saying things poetically, smoothly and touching to our souls instantly. In leading roles we meet with three characters whom looking for their roots and their future hopelessly in their inner and outer journeys. Our global worlds giving us idea of different country, homeland concepts. Most of the young people thinking of living far away from their country but they are trying keep the idea of homeland in their minds. Of course its not easy the describe this film as a story teller director uses various techniques.</p>
