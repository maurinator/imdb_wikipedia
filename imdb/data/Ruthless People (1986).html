<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brought by the makers of AIRPLANE, RUTHLESS PEOPLE is a laugh riot of a movie.  Danny DeVito leads the pack as a greedy millionaire who plans to murder his wife for her money, but becomes rapturous when she is kidnapped.  DeVito is hilarious in the lead role.  Judge Reinhold delivers a wacky performance as the kidnapper.  Helen Slater does a great job  and she's also beautiful  as the kidnapper's fashion designer wife, but the real star of the movie is Bette Midler, as DeVito's kidnapped wife.  Though this movie lacks a little bit of the quality that AIRPLANE had, it still has its share of really good performances and hilarious one-liners.  Great entertainment!4 out of 5</p>
