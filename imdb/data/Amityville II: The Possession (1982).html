<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am not a huge fan of the Amityville Horror (1979), it was okay movie but not that scary, as it was made out to be.This movie starts of with a new family moving in to the house, a father and mother and four kids, two daughters and two sons.At first everything seem normal, until the strange things start to happen to younger two kids, as the house messed one room up but father dose not believe the kids and then he hits the poor kids, then eldest son, then point a shotgun at is father to make him stop what he doing. (I have never hated anyone, as much as I hated the father in this movie).Soon after Sonny the oldest of the sons, start to act a bit at strange and start to feel sick, then while the whole family is out, we see how becomes possessed by the house. Small spoiler, I liked the scenes, where we see Sonny get possessed by the house, when we see him screaming in pain, when he stomach he being press down by the unseen evil force, was really good scene, that was scary and really darkthat is one the reason i liked this movie more then first and this is a lot more darker then first movie and the acting was outstanding from everyoneI would have give this movie 10 but I find the ending, a tad boring and disappointing.so I am going to give this movie a 8 out of 10</p>
