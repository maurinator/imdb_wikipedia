<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I finally got to see this film again. I love this film. But I realized after another viewing with a savvy partner that there are just too many holes in the plot and Mamet isn't quite as clever as we first think or would like to believe. Too many plot twists just don't make sense on second viewing. I'd always recommend this movie.. it's fascinating and has great performances but I think the audience is easily tricked into finding it brilliant. Maybe someone can explain why Martin's character is so easily found in the car showroom. Did I miss something there? And what if Campbell Scott's person had actually tried to deliver the tennis book directly to Martin's sister. That would have been the end of the story, period.</p>
