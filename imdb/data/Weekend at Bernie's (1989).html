<p>Two losers try to pretend that their murdered employer is really alive, leading the hitman to attempt to track him down to finish him off.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is great from start to finish. The characters are well developed and Andrew McCarthy(The Joy Luck Club) and Jonathan Silverman(The Single Guy) play wonderfully off of each other. The Dialogue was better then that of any modern made comedy I have seen. This is a dark comedy but for the family which is something I have never seen done before. This movie is unique and over the head of anyone who didn't like it.</p>
