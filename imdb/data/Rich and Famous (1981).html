<h1>Rich and Famous (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Liz and Merry Noel become friends as college roommates and their friendship endures over the years. Liz becomes a respected "serious" novelist. Merry Noel marries, has a daughter and writes, too: "trash" fiction which becomes enormously successful. Their story begins in college and jumps ahead some years at a time to show their relationship with each other and those in their orbits as they grow and mature.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was the last film that George Cukor directed, and the subject matter - looking at how a friendship develops over time - is appropriate content for a swan song from a director who had made many very different films over the years. However, as fitting as the premise might seem, the film is certainly not a high note for Cukor to end his career on. It is uneven in tone, and jumps through time without giving the impression that it is doing so, as the characters hardly change or age. It is no help that the characters are hard to like either, or that Bergen is an annoyance to have on screen. Bisset handles her part fairly well on the other hand, and she is able to pull through despite the excessive sexual antics given to her character. The film suffers from being too talkative too, but the dialogue does contain some wit, and there are some amusing moments in the mix. Overall, it is not a strong end to George Cukor's career, and it is not even a particularly good film. Still, for Bisset and Cukor completists, there will enough of interest here to be worth a look.</p>
