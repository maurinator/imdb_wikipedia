<p>A larger lamp watches while a smaller, younger lamp plays exuberantly with a ball but doesn't pick up the knack of correct handling.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An indulgent & bemused parent - who just happens to be a desk lamp - watches its child, LUXO JR., romp with a plastic ball.This tiny film, produced in 1986, showed the computer animation world what results were possible, even on a small scale, when imagination is unloosed at the keyboard. The personality given to the two character objects is remarkable, especially considering the extremely short running time.Little Luxo would go on to become the corporate symbol for Pixar, who are ranked near the top of the tree in their field of expertise.</p>
