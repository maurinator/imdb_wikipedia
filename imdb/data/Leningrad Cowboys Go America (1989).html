<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>at first i thought what is this? then you let the leningrad cowboys take you along and the movie just gets better. the music is an obvious highlight all through the movie but that is just one of many. it is the costumes and hairstyles that make this movie perfect. the lost cousin is a brilliant plot twist and picks the music up and the viewer as well. keep an eye on the bass player, that is all i will say about him. a genuinely funny movie that is so far left of centre it is unbelievable, but when you watch the movie, no, this is all very believable. watch it as many times as you can. i was the only person to rent it from the video shop so they sold it to me cheap. the best buy i ever made.</p>
