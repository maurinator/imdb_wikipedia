<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This episode isn't as good as previous one, honestly I was little bit disappointed. There was one mistake with DNA, but it was not so important for me. Brennan is learning about human psychology from Booth for 4 years, but she still asks him stupid things like she haven't learned anything. It is really annoying. In my opinion, writers should change something in her character, because this show would become very boring.One thing I liked most is new guy - Fisher with his killing smile:) And it is still interesting to know about relationships of Hodgins/Angela, Brennan/Booth. And, of course, how will end story with Zack... My Rating: 7/10</p>
