When she falls ill, he makes inquiries about her, both start to converse and are drawn toward each other. She confides in him about her wealthy childhood, that was the time she was called by her real name, Surabhi, and how her brother had coerced her into marrying a much older man - compelling her to forsake all materialistic bonds and becoming a Sanyasin/Jogan. The question remains: Will she accept now him as her life partner?</p>
<p>An atheist falls in love with a married devout woman who has forsaken materialistic life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very down to earth story line; sublime performance by both Nargis and Dilip Kumar; heart warming music and sobering tragedy is how one can sum up this movie. A classic by any standard in Indian movies. Dilip Kumar is young and looks breathtakingly cute.</p>
