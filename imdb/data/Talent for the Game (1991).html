Money-hungry owners want to make a quick buck while Sammy just wants to play ball. Virgil finds himself caught in the middle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'd switched on the TV because I couldn't sleep, and a film had just started. It was around 1am, and they don't usually show this kind of feel good movie around that time, so the film was very welcome. I'd never seen James Edward Olmos in a film before this one, or I didn't remember him because I must have seen him in Bladerunner. So I didn't realise that he was such a decent actor. He's got such a common face, like a farmer, so this charismatic performance was surprising. Anyway, it was a cute little film, and it is worth watching if you've got nothing better to do.</p>
