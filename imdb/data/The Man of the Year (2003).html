<h1>The Man of the Year (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Rio, Máiquel is without prospects. He's philosophical and low-key. When he loses a bet and must dye his hair blond, life changes: he finds new confidence, he asks Cledir, the hairdresser, on a date, and when he's teased by a local tough kid, he murders him. Instead of an arrest, Máiquel's a local hero; the cops look the other way. He and Cledir become lovers, his victim's girlfriend Érica, who's 15, insists that he protect her and moves into his small flat, and job offers come his way from a group of rich men who want to settle scores and get rid of local riff-raff. Where can this business go, and what about the triangle of Cledir, Érica and Máiquel? He just wants to be normal?</p>
<p>Maiquel has lost a bet and dyed his hair blond. This little event triggers a head-on collision with destiny in which Maiquel goes from nobody to hero to outlaw--all in 24 hours.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film last weekend on DVD and can't get it out of my mind. It seems a dark commentary with a dark humour on the violence that many experience and feel threatened by in certain parts of Brazilian cities. While the main character's becoming a neighbourhood hero through vigilante justice may be a caricature, the film speaks (through its characters) of the racial and social stereotyping that that may be a problem in Brazilian society. There is a scene where one of Dr. Carvalho's circle describes being burglarized by a nervous young black who claims to be committing the crime out of desperate poverty. In telling of this, Dr. Carvalho's companion treats this with contempt. But perhaps less poverty would mean less crime.While it's obviously very unpleasant being robbed, there was an unpleasant lack of empathy there. The police, too, seem just as bad as those they are supposed to jail. Anyway, while I won't say this was a better film that "Cidade de Dios," it affected me more.</p>
