<h1>Mere Apne (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anandi has been a widow for several years, living all herself in a small village. One day out of the blue comes Arun Gupta, claiming to her relative, and literally begs her to come to live with him and his family in the city, which she does. Once in the city, she finds out that things are not the same as in the village, there is very little or no compassion, violence, gang-fights, and children being abused. She befriends one such abused child and attempts to bring him to the Gupta family, and she finds out that she is not welcome there anymore. She finds out that Arun had actually brought her to the city, not of pity, love or compassion, but for doing household duties, and baby-sitting, without any wages. She moves out and lives in a broken-down structure with the homeless child, hoping and waiting that someday, someone will actually come for her, and claim her as family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie shows that unemployment leads to a lot of social problems and otherwise good people turn against each other. Meena kumari has done magic with her supporting role. Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha be long to rival gangs  formed to support their beliefs in the corrupt political system of India.  How a outcast old woman tries in vain to bring them to their senses forms the story.</p>
