<h1>The Big Kahuna (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the last evening of a convention two seen-it-all industrial lubricant salesmen and a youngster from the research department gather in the hotel's hospitality suite to host a delegates party. The main aim is to get the business of one particular big fish. When it becomes apparent that it is the lad who has developed a direct line to the guy, his strong religious beliefs bring him into sharp conflict with his older and more cynical colleagues.</p>
<p>Three sales representatives attend a trade show in the American Midwest to sell industrial lubricants. Larry Mann and Phil Cooper are two longtime friends, while young Bob Walker is a newcomer, lent by the company's R&D; team to help in the booth. The three hope to meet a business executive Larry refers to as 'the Big Kahuna, el Kahuna grande' in the hopes of landing an account. As their hotel stay proceeds, the gap in life experience between young Bob and his two colleagues grows ever more apparent. That gap threatens to become a chasm when the executive invites Bob, and only Bob, to meet with him.</p>
<p>Two veteran salesmen dissect a sales pitch to a particular client, through their young protégé.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I saw this movie, I had one sole motivation- It had Kevin Spacey in it. That, in my opinion, makes any of his films worth at least a glance. He's so brilliant. Also, I was in the mood for a good comedy. This film presented me with both the expected comedy and brilliant performance by Spacey. However, I guess I neglected to read up on what this movie was all about first.Let me say that, as a Christian (and a Baptist), the portrayal of Bob is the single most realistic on screen portrayal of a true Christian that I have ever seen. Bravo to them for not giving into cliches! While some attacks were made on Bob's faith, they weren't presented as right or wrong, but different view points. I was frankly shocked (pleasently) by this film. I would deffinately recommend it.Also, I am not a particurally big DeVito fan, but he turns in a truly moving and realistic performance in this film. 7/10</p>
