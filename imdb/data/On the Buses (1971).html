<h1>On the Buses (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stan gets a little annoyed when his Mum and Sister keep buying expensive items on hire purchase, but the money he earns for overtime working as a bus driver means that he can afford it... just! His job is secure, as bus drivers are hard to come by, and his overtime prospects are good, until the bus company decide to revoke a long standing rule and employ women bus drivers. Aghast at the thought of no overtime and, therefore, less wages, he joins forces with his long time work colleague Jack to sabotage the new female employees.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We seem to live in a world of "watch what you say & do". Today's sitcoms are ruled by very well calculated PC rules. We have all embraced this refreshingly new approach to behavior. Unfortunately we are losing our sitcom heritage. We can now only laugh at a very narrow band of situations e.g "man bashing" seems to be a favourite with modern writers. Can't blame 'em, they've got bills to pay as well as me & thee. On The Buses gives us a window into the past. Prior to the 1980's this is how life was. I know I've lived there. All the characters are charicatures (eh?) of people we have known and either loved or hated. Mum (Doris Hare) is holding on to her long suffering but loyal son Stan (Reg) who never gets his way with the ladies as does Jack (Bob). This is one of the mysteries of the universe!!. Blakey is the boss we've all had & hated. Bring back British Sitcom.</p>
