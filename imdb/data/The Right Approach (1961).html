<h1>The Right Approach (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of five fun-loving young bachelors who live together in a converted nightclub in the Hollywood Hills. Newcomer Leo Mack is a young Hollywood hopeful who stirs up trouble when he arrives, using his brother and their roommates and anyone else he can as stepping stones in his climb for fame and fortune as a singing and acting star.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Frankie Vaughan plays an ambitious social climber intent on clawing his way up the Hollywood ladder to stardom. Instead of enjoying the journey, Vaughan's character of Leo Mack is focused entirely on his desired destination, meaning that he steps on or over the people he meets along the way. The character of Leo Mack draws people in and tends to confuse them into believing talent is present where it actually is not. This becomes apparent in the singing scenes, which, for the purposes of the film, are bizarre enough to make for fairly hard-to-stop-looking-at viewing. Thus a character with ruthless ambition who manipulates everyone and every event he can to go his way, with an absence of actual talent.</p>
