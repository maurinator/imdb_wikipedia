<h1>Insignificance (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Four 1950's cultural icons (Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio and Senator Joseph MacCarthy) who conceivably could have met and probably didn't, fictionally do in this modern fable of post-WWII America. Visually intriguing, the film has a fluid progression of flash-backs and flash-forwards centering on the fictional Einstein's current observations, childhood memories and apprehensions for the future.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein has come to the city to give a lecture about his work. When he retires to his hotel room later in the evening he has the most unexpected visitor; Marilyn Monroe! And things get more complicated when senator McArthee and her ex-husband show up in the same hotel and the same room...</p>
<p>Four 1950s icons meet in the same hotel room and two of them discover more in common between them than they ever anticipated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film.  It probably was originally a play, and that's why it's dialogue heavy, but I can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters.This film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character-driven story.</p>
