<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chandni is probably Sridevi's most popular film and it's easy to see why. Sridevi is positively luminescent and makes you want to fall in love with her. Her co-stars Rish Kapoor and Vinod Khanna pale in comparison. The songs composed by Shiv-Hari are quite good and there's some terrific dancing by Sridevi, specially in the number "Mere Haathon Mein". The plot is a standard Bollywood love triangle but Yash Chopra manages to make it feel fresh. The second half tends to drag though. The film is very long and could have been better edited. 'Chandni' is worth watching for lovers of Hindi film romances and specially for fans of Sridevi.Overall 710</p>
