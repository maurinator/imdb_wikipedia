<h1>Derek and Clive Get the Horn (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Russell Mulcahy (of "Highlander" fame) films British comedy luminaries Peter Cook and Dudley Moore recording their last comedy album featuring two of their most beloved characters, lavatory attendants Derek and Clive. Booze, drugs, strippers and practical jokes (sometimes bitter and sick on the part of Cook) are provided. Throughout the recording, Moore has to weather the abuse and disdain of his longtime partner in the wake of his success in the American market (with films like '10' (1979) and Foul Play (1978)). The film marked the last appearance of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore together as a team and the end of their partnership which began with "Beyond the Fringe" in 1959. The men discuss "getting the horn" (i.e. getting "in the mood") at the most unlikely times, improvise songs filled with obscenities (Cook's two-note piano opus entitled "Dutch Bitch" is coarse and hilarious to those who are not easily offended) and work out their aggressions toward one another in the strangest ways, in the midst of putting the album together. They engage in all-out war and undeniable camaraderie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The brilliance of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as a double act has never fully been apreciated. Most of the famous sketches are from Not only But Also, but the funniest ones come from the Derek and Clive tapes. Derek and Clive Get the Horn is the Jewel in the comical crown for both Cook and Moore as comedians. It is also something of a last hurrah. Although both men would appear together again over the years, this was the last original performance they gave together, and it rarely came, excuse the pun, funnier than this. Dud is at his giggling funniest best and Pete cracks Dud up with his waspish dry wit throughout. Overall not a movie to show grandma on Boxing day, or any other day come to that. Come to think of it its best you watch it on your own. With the curtains drawn, at Two 0 clock in the morning. And it was directed by Russel Mulcahey! Good GODFavourite sketches : Mother, Horse Racing, Songs and Schoolboy. Just so you know i have seen it and iam not making it up! A classic</p>
