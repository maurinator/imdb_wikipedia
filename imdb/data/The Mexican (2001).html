<h1>The Mexican (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jerry Welbach is given two ultimatums. His mob boss wants him to travel to Mexico to get a priceless antique pistol called "The Mexican" or he will suffer the consequences. The other ultimatum comes from his girlfriend Samantha, who wants him to end his association with the mob. Jerry figures that being alive, although in trouble with his girlfriend is the better alternative so he heads south of the border. Finding the pistol is easy but getting it home is a whole other matter. The pistol supposedly carries a curse - a curse Jerry is given every reason to believe, especially when Samantha is held hostage by the gay hit man Leroy to ensure the safe return of the pistol.</p>
<p>A man tries to transport an ancient gun called The Mexican, believed to carry a curse, back across the border, while his girlfriend pressures him to give up his criminal ways.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I would have liked to have seen the Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts characters arrive to cosmopolitan, beautiful Mexico City with its tree lined avenues that resemble Paris, and to have seen them expelled from one of its exclusive restaurants or hotels for being so vulgar and lower class. I would have liked to see them blunder at a party in the upper class Chapultepec Heights or Polanco neighborhoods among blond Mexican socialites and to have gone stark, staring mad when seeing the luxury and refinement said Mexicans live in.The same applies for other movies such as Fools Rush In and My Family which have such a myopic, erroneous vision of Mexico. American audiences, how would you feel if all movies made about the United States dealt with trailer parks, Appalachian coves and ghettos? Ponder that there are many Mexicans who feel the same. If the prosperous Mexico is a hidden Mexico, please Hollywood producers, discover it. It is infinitely interesting as well.</p>
