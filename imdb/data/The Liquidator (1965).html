<h1>The Liquidator (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Colonel Mostyn is the chief of a section of the British Security Services when they are embarrassed by the number of spies and defections. The Chief tells him to do something about it so he hires Boys Oaks as Agent L - The Liquidator, to assassinate people about to cause trouble. Although Boys likes the cars and the girls that his new position attracts he's not any good at it. He's also got a phobia about flying that makes jetting off to exotic places a bit of an embarrassment.</p>
<p>Colonel Mostyn of the British Intelligence Service suspects there is a leak in his department and hires an American expatriate to eliminate various targets working for the Soviets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just saw "The liquidator". I think it is one of RodÂ´s worst pictures.There is a funny and promising beginning but after ten or fifteen minutes it only is boring. Rod is fun to watch but his character is badly developed.The rest of the movie is very weak. That is a pity because there are talented actors in it, a capable director and a nice basic idea.</p>
