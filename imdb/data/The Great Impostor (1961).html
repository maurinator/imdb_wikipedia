<h1>The Great Impostor (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a true story, a bright young man who hasn't the patience for the normal way of advancement finds that people rarely question you if your papers are in order. He becomes a marine, a monk, a surgeon onboard a Canadian Warship, and a prison warden.</p>
<p>Fitionalized account of Ferdinand Waldo Demara Jr. who stole or created fictional identities and worked in a variety of occupations, most quite successfully. He worked as a prison warden, impersonated a monk and was also a doctor aboard a Royal Canadian Navy warship where he was required to perform an appendectomy. His impersonations are more to allow himself to live different lives as opposed to making any kind of personal gain although he did get in trouble with the law as a result of his exploits.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That this movie, made in 1961, wasn't the inspiration for Frank Abagnale (Catch me if you can), the bit Spielberg/DeCaprio/Hanks hit currently in theaters.  When I saw the promos for CMIYC I thought, "Hey!  This is a remake of an old Tony Curtis film!"The IMDB search shows that The Great Impostor was made in 1961; Frank Abagnales adventures as an imposter started in '62 or '63.  Wonder if he saw the film?I can't remember if I loved The Great Impostor or not but I'm guessing I did;  the plot is sooooooooo similar to Catch Me If You Can and I liked that film quite a lot!</p>
