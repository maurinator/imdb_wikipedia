<h1>The Getting of Wisdom (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Oscar-nominated director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Tender Mercies) crafts a tender coming-of-age tale that introduces one of Australian literature's most beloved characters to the screen, Laura Tweedle Rambotham (Susannah Fowle).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just like to add that the movie was based on a book by a turn of last century feminist Australian writer called Ethel Florence Robertson who wrote under the psedoymn of Henry Handel Richardson. She herself went through a similar experience in her childhood due to her brash nature and musical ability and also the death of her father at a young age. Her sexual orientation and particularly her relation with an old school friend was controversial. It's a funny little story and i think anyone who has been in a situation where they had a different family or social background will relate to it. Not a "wower" but it does give the audience a sense of life going on despite all that people may do.Just a bit of background information for all who would like to know</p>
