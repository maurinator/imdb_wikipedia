<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What more can I say?  Keitel gives an astounding performance.  Then again, when has he let us down?  I was able to find some interesting parallels to "Mean Streets."  Aside from the use of "Pledging my Love" by Johnny Ace, it explores the theme of Catholic guilt and how one's temptation and hunger for evil can weaken spiritual judgments.  The climactic scene is great, in which Keitel (literally) comes face to face with Jesus.  I wasn't a big fan of "Mean Streets" and think this film better explores its Catholic themes.  One may perceive this film to be sinful, and it received tons of controversy.  It's very rare that a movie is able to show rape of a nun, and get away Scott-free with the MPAA.  I think the NC-17 rating was mostly on account of the explicit nudity and sex.  I don't know why the hell people are trying to scare viewers by regarding this movie as "graphically violent."  About all we really see are aftermaths of violence.  However, the language is extremely blunt, and that's about the only warning I can give.  Of course, religious activists might protest its use of footage of Jesus on a cross and the aforementioned rape scene, but they simply have to look closer at what message Ferrara is trying to bring out.  Cinema is an art form often misjudged by the prudish.  The scene where Keitel pulls the two young girls over is classic, and I loved its darkly humorous element.  "Bad Lieutenant" is an impressive character study, and though it occasionally gets meandering and repetitive and seems to be missing something (which I might be able to identify on a second viewing), it's a moving story with terrific acting.  I wasn't too thrilled with the other Ferrara pieces I've seen, "King of New York" and "The Funeral," but I was younger and I think I just had trouble understanding the subtle messages he delivers in his films.  Of course, he specializes in gritty urban dramas like this, being a Bronx native what do you expect, so something like "Bad Lieutenant" naturally wouldn't appeal to general audiences.  It's unpleasant, though somewhat humorous, but life can be the same way.  You can't spend your whole life watching "The Wizard of Oz."  Every once in a while, you have to take a break and watch graphic character studies like this and learn a little something.  After seeing this movie, I'm curious about checking out some more of Ferrara's work, because I know he has talent.  I can tell this a movie I will have to watch again, because it's not easily understood the first time around, but I'm sure there's hidden messages that just flew over my head.  I still think the film could've had more substance, but it's still an impressive work.My score:  7 (out of 10)</p>
