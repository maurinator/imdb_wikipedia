<h1>Dead in a Heartbeat (2002)</h1>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen. A madman who is going around placing bombs in pace makers, this movie combines the standard mad bomber movie with the standard medical chase movie and tosses in the cliche of the bad guy going after the family of the hero at the end.The unique thing about this movie is that as bad as it is (and it is just wrong to make a movie like this) Judge Rinehold actually does one of his better acting jobs in this movie. (Imagine if Billy from Beverly Hills Cop 1 didn't go nuts and became a normal cop.)</p>
