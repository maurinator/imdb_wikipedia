<h1>The Doctor's Dilemma (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mrs. Dubedat loves and idolizes her artist husband, Louis, but he is dying of tuberculosis. She goes to a doctor and convinces him to save her husband. The doctor can keep only so many patients, and must choose who is worth saving, but is convinced that Louis' artistic talents make him worthy. But when he and several colleague meet Louis, they discover that he is in fact a smooth-talking money-grabbing scoundrel. They also learn that he has another wife, whom he has abandoned. So, the doctor has a problem: should he let Louis die, leaving Mrs. Dubedat with her idealized image, or save him and his artistic talents, but force her to face his bigamy and other flaws?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Leslie Caron steals the show as the beautiful natural wife of Dirk Bogarde, who steals the death scene. Around this sinister drama of artful death we have four expert doctors, each eager to cure Dirk Bogarde but in different ways. They are all plunged into second thoughts when they learn what a scoundrel he is. This was one of the plays Bernard Shaw chose to call "plays unpleasant", but it's really outrageously pleasant from a both intellectual and human point of view, and Anthony Asquith as the director interprets every nuance of it perfectly. You can't really blame John Robinson (Dr. Ridgeon) for the way he chooses to resolve his dilemma, even if he ultimately becomes the loser and gets Leslie Caron for an enemy for life. He couldn't have acted differently, carefully weighing the different complications of his case in every aspect. Felix Aylmer as the one retired doctor is the one who sees everything clearly from the beginning, and you follow his diagnoses and comments with interest all the way. Alastair Sim is perfect as the butcher surgeon who wants to cut into his case immediately and deeply regrets it when he doesn't get the chance. Robert Morley as the doctor who actually undertakes the case you are liable to suspect of actually finishing it off. You can't blame Dr. Blenkinsop for surviving either. But the triumph is Leslie Caron's, who walks off brilliantly with all the flying colors that her poor would be husband desired and wished for her.It's a great play expertly handled causing much afterthought, since you have to follow it carefully not to miss any important detail. The settings are all splendid with wonderful colors and Joseph Kosma's music perfecting the perfection. It's a full treat for the relish of a choice audience.</p>
