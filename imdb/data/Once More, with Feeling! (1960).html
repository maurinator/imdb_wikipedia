<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Yul Brynner plays a musical genius whose eccentricities are kept in check by his wife, until she discovers him "auditioning" a sultry young pianist. She walks out on him and his career promptly starts skidding. The temperamental maestro must again win his scorned wife.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the last film made by Kay Kendall, in which she really excelled.....Possibly one of the two or three best films ever for Yul Brynner.....and, a fine performance by one of filmdom's great character actors, Gregory Ratoff.....The subject of this great unseen classic comedy is the story of Victor Fabian (Brynner) as one of the world's greatest conductors, whose townhouse is chock-a-block with hundreds of photos and paintings of himself in ever room, throughout.This film should be considered a must-see.....Hardly ever seen on television it has popped up in special showings with other top comedies such as " The Trouble With Harry "</p>
