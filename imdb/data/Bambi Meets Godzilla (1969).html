<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A sweeping epic of monumental proportions, "Bambi Meets Godzilla" combines a lyrical script, stellar performances by the entire cast, the most outstanding special effects available at the time and a score which is a classic in its own right to produce a spectacle that is as memorable as it is lengthy.  Not many movies can command an audience's attention for as long as "Bambi Meets Godzilla", but here the performances are so engaging, and the visuals so stunning, that it feels as if the movie is over almost before it has begun.  Even so, it is just barely sufficient to contain the entire sweep of the grand drama it has embraced.  Truly a magnum opus in every sense of the word.</p>
