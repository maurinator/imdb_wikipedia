<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many climbers have made to the top of Mt. Everest; many with fantastic video or film. What makes this film truly extraordinary is:* This was a 1953 expedition. No one had been close to the summit; much was unknown. They had to laboriously create the path and lay the ropes&ladders used by subsequent expedition. * They didn't have the advantages of modern tent materials, climbing clothing nor gear; yet they dragged a film camera up most of the way. * Hunt, the expedition leader gives the best explaination of the climbing path and camp positions that I've seen. * The perilousness of the South Col is very evident (the expedition was delayed an extra day due to a storm). This is interesting in retrospect of the 1996 disaster where 9 people died in a stome on the South Col. It also makes me appreciate the tenacity of Beck Weathers, the Dallas physician who survived the 1996 storm with severe frostbite. * The film covers the 175 mile hike required from Katmandu to the first base camp. Now climbers just taken in by helicoptor. * The film focuses on the entire expedition team, including the Sherpas, and not just on Hillary and Norgay. It is very truly a team accomplishment ... Hillary and Norgay made it because of the assigned order of the summit assault teams; not because they were any better climbers than the other. * Great shots of Everest with the blanket of snow blowing off its southface Dangerous terrainThe difficulty of hiking and working at high altitudes</p>
