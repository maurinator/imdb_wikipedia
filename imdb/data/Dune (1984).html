<h1>Dune (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the far future, a duke and his family are sent by the Emperor to a sand world from which comes a spice that is essential for interstellar travel. The move is designed to destroy the duke and his family, but his son escapes and seeks revenge as he uses the world's ecology as one of his weapons.</p>
<p>It is a distant galaxy, in the far future year, 10191. Arrakis is a desert planet and the only source of Melange, a vital drug used by Guild Navigators for space travel from star system to star system. Two families, the Atreides and the Harkonnens, fight one another for sole control of the Melange mining operations on Arrakis. When Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated by the evil Baron Harkonnen, Duke Leto's son, Paul, and Paul's mother, the Lady Jessica, flee deep into the desert of Arrakis. There, they are befriended by the Fremen, natives of Arrakis. Under the influence of Melange, Paul learns he has special powers and, that he can see into the future. Paul unites the Freman under his leadership, forms an army of warriors, and leads them into battle against Baron Harkonnen and the corrupt Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, who is in league with the Harkonnens. Paul vows to avenge his father's murder, and sets out to liberate Arrakis and its people from the Emperor's rule, and to fulfill his destiny.</p>
<p>The desert planet Arrakis - we enter the year 10191 and the whole universe depends on the spice Melange which exists only on this dry and desolate planet. The natives of this planet await the arrival of their Messiah who will lead them into a holy war against the evil Harkonnen empire. This is the film adaptation based on Frank Herbert's cult novel.</p>
<p>Set in a distant future where life in the universe and space travel is dependent upon a spice found only on the planet Dune, this film tracks the rise of young Paul Atreides, son of noble Duke Leto, from the time of his father's betrayal and murder by the evil Baron Harkonnen, to his discovery of the great secret behind the planet Dune and his own destiny, which is to free the planet and its denizens of the cruel rule of the Emperor.</p>
<p>A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis when they assassinate his father and free their desert world from the emperor's rule.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've talked to quite a few die-hard Herbert fans who insist that this film is rubbish. Well, I personally feel that this film is one of the most lavish and elegant science fiction movies ever made. I think it's wonderful, and am happy to have it in my collection.The movie itself inspired me to read the next couple of books in the series.I do agree however that there are some scenes that need to be added in a definitive collection. There are a couple of sequences from the Alan Smithee bootleg version - such as when the water of the Fremen warrior that Paul defeated in combat is re-absorbed into the collective water supply - that are absolutely vital to the story. Yet scenes like this were cut out of the final movie version that we all see on DVD.</p>
