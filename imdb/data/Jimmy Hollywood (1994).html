<h1>Jimmy Hollywood (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jimmy Alto is an actor wannabe who stumbles into the role of a lifetime. He becomes a vigilante crime-fighter, aided by his sidekick William, who has suffered a head wound and has problems with short-term memory. Jimmy's vigilante alter ego soon becomes a media wonder--but Jimmy remains a total unknown and his long-suffering girl friend Lorraine is getting fed up with the whole situation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just watched this movie and was delighted with all the characters. Pesci was not his usual hyper-character(which he does well)but somewhat subdued. At the same time being pushed by his hope of getting "the role" that has always eluded him. Finally, he finds it in reality.The ending was great! I never even heard of this movie before. I am glad I caught it and would recommend it.It made me laugh and made me feel sad also. At the end it did remind me of "The King of Comedy." Maybe not as well written but it kept me watching and grinning as well as feeling a bit nostalgic for the old Hollywood. Especially when 'Jimmy' and "Lorraine" were at Errol Flynns old house as they danced to the sounds of urban chaos.</p>
