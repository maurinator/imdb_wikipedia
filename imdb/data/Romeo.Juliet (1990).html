<h1>Romeo.Juliet (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The tale centers on an eccentric bag lady who rescues the stray cats of Venice and puts them on a boat to set sail for the new world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A Masterpiece of music and visual motion. A one of a kind treat for the heart. Set to Prokofiev's theme Romeo-Juliet uses the gracefulness of cats to poetically "dance" to the accompanying score. The poetry of Shakespeare echoes through the voices of wonderful actors. An entirely different genre of film. Magnificent.</p>
