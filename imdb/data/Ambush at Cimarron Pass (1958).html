<h1>Ambush at Cimarron Pass (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The survivors of an Army patrol ambushed by Indians hook up with a group of cowboys who have also been attacked, and together they try to get to safety at the fort. Unfortunately for them, they're carrying a shipment of several dozen rifles that the Indians want, and are determined to get.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very low budget B-Movie. No surprise, no originality, no creativity, lots of cliche, but an honest sense of rythmn. We can almost see the paintings of the studio setting. One good reason to watch this is to see young Clint Eastwood before his cinema fame (circa 1965).</p>
