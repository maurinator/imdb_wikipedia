<h1>In Like Flint (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Flint is again called out of retirement when his old boss finds that he seems to have missed three minutes while golfing with the president. Flint finds that the president has been replaced by an actor (Flint's line [with a wistful look] is "An Actor as President?") Flint finds that a group of women have banded together to take over the world through subliminal brainwashing in beauty salons they own.</p>
<p>Super-spy Flint takes on a cabal of women plotting to rule the world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well it looks like I'm in a minority with this one as I think 'In Like Flint' is better than 'Our Man Flint'! It's goofier than the original and for me that makes it more entertaining. It's filled with silly stuff like exploding golf balls, brainwashing via hairdryers, Flint talking fluent dolphin and Lee J. Cobb in drag. It's similar in approach to the 'Batman' TV series (Yvonne "Batgirl" Craig even appears as a Russian ballerina) so if you enjoy that show, and yes, Austin Powers, you'll have lots of fun.</p>
