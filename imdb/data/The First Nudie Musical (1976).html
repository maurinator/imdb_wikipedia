<h1>The First Nudie Musical (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The son of famous studio owner is forced to make porno films to keep the bankrupt studio from being made into a shopping center. In an attempt to get back on the high ground he makes a nudie musical. He makes a bet with the debtors who wish to take ownership of the studio, that if they finance the musical and he can't complete it within two weeks, they can foreclose.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a refreshingly bad movie about an industry that was simply bad without the refreshing part added.  Like "Flesh Gordon" it tried to tackle several genres (business, porn, and low budget motion picture, in this case) and managed to skewer them all at once.Okay, sometimes a movie is just for fun.  Naughty fun, maybe, but fun.  No deep meanings, no discussions in the lobby about how "the leafless black tree in the snow was symbolic of the director's inner child seeking the approval of" type of BS, just entertainment-- a chance to make us look at ourselves and laugh.Now if we could do it without the porn. . . .</p>
