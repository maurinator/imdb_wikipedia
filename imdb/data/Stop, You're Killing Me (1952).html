<h1>Stop, You're Killing Me (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After the repeal of Prohibition, a beer-maker decides to sell beer legally, but no one wants to buy his revolting beer, and he does not want to force sales.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a fun movie! Kind of a precursor of "Some Like it Hot" the movie has a lot of fun with the Runyonesque characters (Runyon wrote the screenplay) and the goofy goings on of a Prohibition beer baron who decides to go legit when Prohibition is repealed. Broderick Crawford is wonderful as the blustering but soft-hearted Remy Marko. The film also has a few nicely placed and very enjoyable musical numbers, and who knew Broderick Crawford could sing so pleasantly (turns out his parents were both opera singers!). The farce is generous and hilarious, with dead bodies cropping up everywhere, and Margaret Dumont putting in a turn as the usual easily offended matron. Joseph Vitale, Sheldon Leonard and Charles Cantor do a great job as Marko's lovable hood sidekicks. Harry Morgan appears but his contribution is limited mostly to climbing over transoms and in and out of windows. The production values are wonderful. All in all a surprisingly wonderful treat.</p>
