<h1>The Love Letter (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The power of words and images to open hearts. Helen runs, miles a day, to burn off energy: she's an emotional celibate. Going through the post at her shop, she finds a romantic and poetic letter between the couch cushions, unsigned, and thinks it's for her. It melts her resistance to feelings, and soon she undertakes an affair with Johnny, a collegiate employee. (He sees the letter and thinks she wrote it to him; he quotes some of it, so she thinks he wrote it to her.) In the background are Helen's long-time friend, George, who loves her, and her mother who abruptly left on a long trip months' before. Discovering who actually wrote the letter brings insight and promise.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the greatest and most wonderful surprises of 1999, "The Love Letter" is a sparkling little film. Held back by a remarkably asinine trailer--which manages to combine the three or four dull, brief moments in the movie--the picture is a warm-hearted, eminently watchable tale. I had assiduously avoided the flick because of that very trailer, but ended up having to watch "The Love Letter" on an 11 hour flight from Seoul to Vancouver. I could easily have watched it three times--it's that much fun.Kate Capshaw is bent and broken-down but somehow manages to be both incredibly lovable and believable. Tom Everett Scott is absolutely priceless in his role as a confused young hunk. but any damage they may have done to the overall film is negated by the superb performances of Scott and Capshaw. Sure, it's not worthy of an Oscar. But neither was "Shakespeare in Love", and look what happened there.</p>
