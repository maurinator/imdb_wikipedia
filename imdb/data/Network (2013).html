<h1>Network (2013)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Compton runs a low budget ratings starved TV network. She seeks to fire the bosses nephew, Brad who hosts "Hoax Hunter" by sabotaging his efforts. To save his job, he and his girlfriend Stacy do a live broadcast in search of Big Foot which ends up topless. Suddenly the ratings spike upwards and the tables are turned. Seven gratuitous soft core sex scenes are sprinkled throughout.</p>
<p>A failing TV Station is revitalized when their Reality Show, Hoax Hunter, goes topless in search of Bigfoot.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of a series of soft porn films that pop up on Cinemax or some such channel almost nightly which repeat viewers will note have familiar actors and actresses such as Christine Nguyen and Beverly Lynne. They often are something of a parody (multiple ones has some sort of sci fi theme, counted around six) or at least try to be lighthearted with some comic touch. They are a mixed bag.This is one of the better efforts. The idea is a low rent television network goes big time by chance when an executive's nephew's gf tosses in some breasts. As the executive (a familiar face) says, "who doesn't like boobs?" Meanwhile, another Mary Carey plays the upset programming director whose position is usurped, just when she thought she was rid of the troublesome nephew. The gf is played by Jazy Berlin, who looks about as much like a big breasted Barbie doll as Mary Carey, but has more of a light touch. Still, Carey (including when doing the name drop -- that is, when the title is dropped into the story -- "I don't want this to be an all babe network" or whatever) is decent too.It all is doing with a sense of humor though the sex scenes are fairly average (sorta par for the course -- depends on taste, I guess) and it's hard to retain interest the whole way. Still, what do you expect, Shakespeare. For what it is, it is better than usual, with some real acting ability (again grading on a curve). Volume does gain skill there.</p>
