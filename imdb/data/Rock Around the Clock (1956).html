<h1>Rock Around the Clock (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A frustrated big-band promoter runs in to rock-and-rollers Bill Haley and the Comets at a small-town dance. He quickly becomes their manager and, with the help of Alan Freed, hopes to bring the new sound to the entire country. But will a conniving booking agent, with a personal ax to grind with the manager, conspire to keep the band from making the big time?</p>
<p>The first true rock and roll feature film, Rock Around the Clock is a highly fictionalized account of the discovery of rock and roll by small-time promoter Steve Hollis, when Hollis visits a small town to find Bill Haley and the Comets packing in the crowds. Hollis also finds time for romance with teenage dancer Lisa. The main purpose of the film was to introduce Haley to a worldwide film audience. The band was joined by fellow rockers Freddie Bell and the Bellboys along with The Platters for this early rock musical. This film was banned in many countries after reports of teenagers ripping up the seats in their excitement over the loud, raucous music on the soundtrack, though today the film is more likely to spur nostalgia.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It ain't great cinema, folks, but it IS fun. It's also a great reminder of the roots of rock- and-roll (old-fashioned hyphenated spelling intentional), and how far that musical genre has developed in the last (choke) 50 years. I was only 9 when this film was released, and had never seen it until today (thanks, Turner Classics). Bill Hailey was certainly no Eric Clapton on the guitar, but was definitely a showman...in what would now be considered a cornball sort of way. The whole film is a good display of the fact that choreographing singers' movements didn't start with Madonnna. It also shows modern viewers that the Platters could REALLY sing!Another thing I really enjoyed was the dancing in this movie. Lisa Gaye and Earl Barton could move! About an hour and 15 minutes into the film (which is only about 1:20 long) there's a number which shows them off well, during which they're joined by a couple of dozen other excellent dancers. It's a fun way to end the film.</p>
