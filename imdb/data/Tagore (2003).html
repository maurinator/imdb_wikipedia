<h1>Tagore (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ravindranath Tagore, A physics professor forms ACF [Anti Corruption Force] along with his former students to take on the corruption in the society</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the better films against Corruption, though sometimes appears like a documentary, contains some of the best scenes to hit the Indian screen in recent times.The best part is the Corrruption is shown in Hospitals, with the Indian PDS, Police force, PWD dept. Real Estate promoters etc and the climax (Court scene) is great quoting Rabindra Nath Tagore's Geethanjali. Also the scene where Chiru reels of the vital stats of AP state is very well shot - "Our AP State government (1998 - 2003) through the Central govt has taken a loan of Rs.57,000 Crs from the World bank imposing a burden Rs.7500 on every citizen of Andhra Pradesh". Kidnapping the 15 most corrupt officers and eliminating the most corrupt one and equating it to a running race where the one who comes first will be shot dead is a novel way of presenting the story.</p>
