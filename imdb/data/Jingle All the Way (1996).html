<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sometimes critics mistake.This is definitely an example.You see some movies don't need to be reviewed,you just need to watch them first,and then judge your feelings. So idea of the movie is great,and its pretty familiar to EVERY father on Christmas.And that's why people like to associate themselves with Arnie's character.There are a lot of misadventures(you wont remember every after ending i promise),but they actually work out pretty entertaining,sometimes even laughably funny (Santa's gang scene). Also contains good soundtrack,that includes Chuck Berry's "Run Rudolf,Run". i also like casting choice for Ted.I don't like this type of sleazy scumbags,thats why he is so realistically annoying.Not much else to say,WATCH IT NOW.</p>
