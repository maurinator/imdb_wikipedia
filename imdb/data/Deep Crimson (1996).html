<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in 1940s northern Mexico, this film re-tells the story of "The Lonely Hearts Killers", a famous couple of murderers who made victims of lonely and wealthy widows in the USA. Coral (Orozco) is a rotund and passionate nurse who knows handsome gigolo Nicolas Estrella (Gimenez Cacho) and falls for him immediately. Nicolas rejects her because she's not rich, but Coral is determined to get him at any cost. She abandons her children and follows the man in spite of his way of living. Together they will scheme to swindle and murder women who look for love and companions writing letters to a sentimental courier.</p>
<p>The life of a man who preys on unsuspecting women for a living is changed when he finds an accomplice in the woman who loves and controls him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Arturo Ripstein's "Deep Crimson" is based on the same Lonely Heart Killers case that inspired "The Honeymoon Killers". Regina Orozco is riveting as the unattractive and fundamentally unlikeable nurse who abandons her children to take up with Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho's pathetic, balding gigolo. They answer letters from lonely widows with the intention of robbing them, but jealousy and general incompetence lead them into a string of murders. Despite the sordid and depressing subject matter, the film has a distinct satirical edge and is often quite funny. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the earlier film.</p>
