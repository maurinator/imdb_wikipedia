<h1>The Satan Bug (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A germ warfare lab has had an accident. The first theory is that one of the nasty germs has gotten free and killed several scientists. The big fear is that a more virulent strain, named The Satan Bug because all life can be killed off by it should it escape, may have been stolen.</p>
<p>Lee Barrett was until recently a security officer at Station 3, a top secret government laboratory. He was fired for insubordination but is called back to duty by General Williams when biological warfare agents are stolen from the facility. Of particular concern is the Satan Bug, a new and particularly virulent bacteriological weapon that could, if released, destroy all of mankind in a few weeks or months. The thief threatens to release the Satan Bug in a public place and Barrett races against time to stop him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an enjoyable and nerve-wracking thriller of an inside robbery as a top secret Germ Warfare lab and the theft of enough deadly bacteria (The Satan Bug) to kill a city. In this case the madman is Richard Basehart (cross reference E.G. Marshall in a similar role), and look for an early Ed Asner as one of his thugs. Although a little drawn out at times, this is an effective movie worth seeing.</p>
