<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Who knows why we retain the memory of some films and others remain a forgotten blip.  "The Lacemaker" stayed with me over the years.  I thought Isabelle Huppert played a marvelous part, and the story line fascinated me.  I can still feel the sadness of her character when she was rejected by her lover, and then paid the price for her addiction to him. Films like "Blade Runner," "Murmur of the Heart," "Experience Preferred but not Essential, " The Unbearable Lightness of Being," "Closely Watched Trains," and a host of other good films will always be special to me, but not as endearing as "La Dentelliere."</p>
