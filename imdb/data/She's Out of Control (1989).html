<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't mind this film.  It's one of those films that are good to watch really late at night, when you really just want to wind down.  It is pretty silly, but it has some funny moments.  Ami Dolenz can't act very well, but in the role she is playing it really doesn't matter.  Dana Ashbrook is very amusing as the leather clad boyfriend from hell.  But Matthew Perry is not particularly convincing as the all too perfect Yale college boy.  Tony Danza seems to be treating the whole exercise like an extended version of a Who's the Boss? episode, which is probably why he was given the part.  Although it's not very original, and similar theme films have done it much better, it's still not a bad effort.  At least it was not boring.</p>
