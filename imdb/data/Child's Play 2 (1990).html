<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chucky, the sweet-faced lovable little doll filled with the soul of a voodoo loving serial killer, is back in his second feature, aptly if not originally named Child's Play 2.  The only other member of the cast of the original film to return is the young Alex Vincent as the boy Chucky must kill so as to not permanently be imprisoned in the body of the doll.  Brad Douriff is back as the maniacal voice of the pint-sized murderer.  What you would expect from a sequel of this caliber is pretty much what you get.  Little plot, little characterization, lots of killing, lots of blood, lots of gore effects, and a Chucky that comes back, comes back, comes back, comes back, and comes back.  I got so tired of watching Chucky come out of situations where he was supposed to be 'dead" that it was like a test of endurance for my common sense.  Vincent does a good job with his role, but the film really lacks from the freshness and individuality of the original film's characters.  I don't know why people that make horror sequels always think it is just the gore and blood which makes the first film popular.  They are integral parts, but the film probably(not always) has other elements that appeal to people over 15.  This sequel eliminates those elements and makes it very clear that its intended audience is between 15-19.  Pity, because I found the first film very effective and slightly intelligent on one level.  This film is really nothing more than one killing after another until we get to the factory where other Chuckies are made and the real nonsense begins in what has to be one of the most ridiculous finales of a horror film I have seen in some time.  Now it sounds like I am really bashing this film...and I am...but one small concession on my part is that the film moves by quickly and is entertaining on a bad its good level.</p>
