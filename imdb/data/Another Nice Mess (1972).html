<h1>Another Nice Mess (1972)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film the first week it was released. I'm glad I did, because it was also the only week it was released! It opened and closed in Los Angeles within five days. Then, it disappeared forever.It was silly, politically incorrect, and, for me, very enjoyable. I don't believe that Nixon, if he saw it, was amused. At 60 minutes, it moved right along, much like the Laurel and Hardy features it emulated. Rich Little did a perfect Nixon as Oliver Hardy impression, and if you are a Laurel and Hardy fan, you would probably get a kick out of it.I would buy it, if it came out on DVD, but I have a feeling that it will never see the light of day again.1/18/16 All these years later, I found the full film on youtube. https://youtu.be/0sImm2R6amU Enjoy.</p>
