<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film during the Sofia Film Festival in March 2014. I was thoroughly impressed with everything - the story was well woven together, the acting of all characters was beyond reproach - I particularly liked the charming role of the young Anghel Damian who played Victor - and the film works on every level. Apparently the story is to a considerable extent true to real life events. The political impact was a little subdued within some of the plot lines, but perhaps so much the better - it makes for entertaining viewing. The message from the film is that perhaps fading memory should not be allowed to obliterate the mistakes of the past. Well done, Valentin Hotea and cast.</p>
