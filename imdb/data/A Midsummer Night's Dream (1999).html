<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's comedy about two couples in love with the wrong partners, and how they are finally brought together rightly, thanks in part to the bungling work of Puck. It is completely in the language of the Bard, with Pfeiffer as the Fairy Queen and Kline as the one turned into her evening's lover with donkey ears.</p>
<p>Monte Atena, nella campagna toscana, agli inizi del Novecento. Egeo, notabile locale, vorrebbe che la figlia Ermia sposasse Demetrio, giovane benestante, ma la ragazza ama, ricambiata, Lisandro. Perci√≤ i due giovani amanti decidono di fuggire nella foresta, dove si sono recati anche lo stesso Demetrio ed Elena, che lo ama inutilmente. Il tutto sullo sfondo dei preparativi per le nozze del duca Teseo con Ippolita. Le vicende si intrecciano con quelle di una scalcagnata compagnia di comici che spera di recitare alla presenza del duca e con le schermaglie fra Oberon e Titania, re e regina di elfi e fate della foresta. Le scorribande amorose si complicheranno maggiormente a causa del maldestro intervento del folletto Puck, paggio di Oberon. Alla fine, come nelle migliori tradizioni, tutto si aggiusta e le nozze celebrate.......saranno tre !</p>
<p>Lovers' lives are complicated by city law, feuding faerie royalty, and... love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having read other reviews of this film that whine about the scenery, Kevin Kline, etc.,  I have to say that I have no complaints.Obviously they do not remember that the sets that are unreal are supposed to be unreal -- this is supposed to be the realm of the fairies.The scenes that are supposed to be set in reality are VERY real -- and quite beautiful.The scenes that are set in unreality are VERY unreal --and quite beautiful.Calista Flockheart did an admirable job as the always forlorn Helena.Stanley Tucci as Puck was an absolute delight.Rupert Everett as the King of the Fairies.....  well, it isn't exactly a stretch.Kevin Kline did NOT steal the movie -- he was but a part of an ensemble.With the exception of Michelle Pfeiffer every one in the cast knew what their lines meant and delivered them appropriately.Titania's first speech is simply words being repeated by rote -- could have been better.I truly enjoyed this film -- it is a good introduction to Shakespeare for those that are not familiar with him.ENJOY!</p>
