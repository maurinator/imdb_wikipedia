<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On his first day after being released from jail for 14 armed bank robberies, Lucas finds himself caught up in someone else's robbery.

Dugan, a detective, assumes Lucas helped plan the robbery, and hence Lucas, Perry and Meg become three fugitives.</p>
<p>Daniel Lucas, who was recently released from prison after being there because of 14 bank robberies, walks into a bank to start an account, then Ned Perry walks into the bank and tries to rob the place, taking Lucas hostage. Detective Dugan, knowing Lucas's history, assumes that Lucas and Ned are pulling the heist together. With no choice in the matter, Lucas is forced to engineer their getaway. Complicating the situation further is Ned's 6-year-old daughter Meg, who has been mute since the death of her mother. With his bank account depleted, Ned loves Meg so much that he has robbed the bank to get enough money to get Meg the psychiatric care she needs, and so he can have enough money to have custody of Meg and raise her. Meg loves Ned, and finds herself drawn to Lucas as well. While they are on the lam from the cops, the three of them begin to bond as a makeshift family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Francis Veber remakes his 'Les Fugitifs' into 'Three Fugitives'. Having not seen the original French version, as a standalone, I found this one to be charming, heartwarming and entertaining. It also holds nostalgic value for me as I remember first watching it years ago with an old friend.The film never strays away from the main point and it always stays focused on the three main characters Lucas, Ned and Meg. Veber's direction is decent. He doesn't rely on cheap action thrills, such as grand explosion sequences or outrageous chases. The story is quite straightforward but Veber's prime tool of entrainment is the humour which is very effective. There are some hilarious one-liners and situational humour.With a cast that includes Martin Short, Nick Nolte, James Earl Jone and Alan Ruck, very little can go wrong. Nolte and Short are funny as an odd couple, one an ex-con and another a down-on-his luck desperate father. They work well off one another just like Earl Jones and Ruck do. The scenes between Nolte and young Sarah Doroff are endearing to watch.In the end, 'Three Fugitives' is a funny and 'sweet' movie. It's sweet in the sense that there's just the right level of sugar, not too saccharine like the usual Hollywood flick.</p>
