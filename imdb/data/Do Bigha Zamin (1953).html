<h1>Do Bigha Zamin (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A small Bengali landowner and his young son are in danger when their two-acre farmland where they live is in danger of being taken over by a local zamindar (feudal lord) for failure to pay for mounting debits. They move to Calcutta where the father tries making a living as a rickshaw puller while his wife joins him but falls ill which threatens everything they have going to try to save their ancestorial home.</p>
<p>After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. The region's wealthy Zamindar, Thakur Harnam Singh, would like to build a mill, create employment, running water, and electricity for the townspeople, and all he has to do is sign a document signing away the farmers' lands. The only problem is that two acres of land belong to an independent farmer named Shambu Maheto. The Thakur summons Shambu and instructs him to sign a blank document, but Shambu refuses. Angered the Thakur asks him to repay his long overdue loan by 24 hours or lose his land and house. Shambu figures the loan amount together with interest to be about Rs.65/-, which he manages to put together and tenders it to the Thakur. The Thakur claims that he is owed Rs.235/- and takes Shambhu to Court. The Court's decision is in Thakur's favor, and Shambu is given 3 months to come up with money. Having no other alternative, Shambhu travels to Calcutta to find employment, put together the money and return home. He finds work as a rickshaw-puller, and starts to put the loan amount together. His son also assists him by polishing shoes. Watch the climax unfold as Shambu attempts to survive in Calcutta, and his attempts to put together the loan amount.</p>
<p>In the hope of earning enough money to pay off his debts and save his land, a poor farmer becomes a rickshaw puller in the Calcutta and faces many difficulties.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a an Indian classic.... I don't know why so many people here are going on about how unrealistic it is...... I would wonder how many who commented as such have actually been to that part of India and witnessed the poverty there....The story may well have been copied but the film is no doubt still great. I cant think of many other copies which are actually good. This film does actually touch you with its sadness, and claims of melodramaticness will be gladly tossed aside because we are talking about Indian cinema here...All in all i think this is definitely a gem in Indian cinema, and fit the bill of an all time classic.</p>
