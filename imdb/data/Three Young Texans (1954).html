<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a very hard film to find. It took me years to track down a copy. I'm a big Jeffrey Hunter fan. In this film, Jeff overhears that some card sharks ( Michael Ansara & Aaron Spelling) are trying to blackmail Jeff's father. The blackmailers plan to rob a train that hasa federal payroll & force Jeff's father to join them with the robbery. Jeff disrupts their plans by robbing the train himself & puts the money in a safe place. His girlfriend ( Mitzi Gaynor) and his buddy ( Keefe Brasselle) find out what Jeff did. Keefe decides that he wants to keep the payroll money for himself while Jeff wants to return the money to the feds. Keefe joins up with the villains ( bad move) and Jeff goes after them to clear his and his father's name & also to save Keefe from the bad guys.</p>
