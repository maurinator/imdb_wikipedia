<h1>The Funeral (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rene's funeral is to be arranged by the village undertaker Monsieur Alphonse. Flick,along with his girl-friend,Private Helga,will be watching on the off-chance that the mourners will include other Resistance members who can then be arrested,but the plan is leaked so that Monsieur LeClerc will pose as the priest and no Resistance members will attend. Rene himself is passed off as his twin brother from Nancy,also called Rene,come to pay his respects. In the absence of a body Michelle hides some anti-tank missiles that she has been given in the coffin but of course it falls off the hearse,causing an explosion.</p>
<p>Now posing as his brother who has come to run the café, Rene now has to make arrangements for his own funeral. The undertaker visits the café and after showing off his wares, insists on measuring the deceased. After choosing his coffin - and is shocked at the prices - Rene weighs it down with bottles and an anti-tank mine the Resistance has left in his keeping. Herr Flick of the Gestapo attends the funeral in the hope of identifying anyone from the Resistance. The funeral goes off with a bang.</p>
