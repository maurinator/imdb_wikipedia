<h1>The Chosen (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brooklyn 1944. Despite being the same age, having grown up within blocks of each other, and both being Jewish, late teens Danny Saunders and Reuven Malter don't really know each other - knowing each other only by name and by sight - as Orthodox Danny stays largely within his own Hasidic community, which is just fine in Reuven's mind. An incident between the two which on the surface threatens to tear them even further apart instead blossoms into a friendship between the two. They begin to learn more and more about the other and their lives, which for Danny includes becoming a rabbi, solely as it is a several generations old family calling. In Reb Saunders' mind, he who rules his family by strict Hasidic traditions, Danny becoming the next rabbi in the family is not even a question, despite Danny, deep in his heart, wanting other secular pursuits which he has not told his father. Conversely, Reuven has modern sensibilities, being raised in a two-person household by his widowed academic father, Professor David Malter. Ultimately, the views of each father may tear Danny and Reuven's friendship apart, regardless of whether each son believes wholeheartedly in what his father espouses. Professor Malter is a confirmed Zionist who believes in a secular Jewish state in Palestine, while Reb Saunders believes such thinking against Judaism, with only the Messiah being able to lead his people into such. As they grow into adulthood, Danny and Reuven becoming his own man may further alter their relationship.</p>
<p>In 1944, in Brooklyn, two Jewish kids become friends. One is from a very conservative family, and the other is more liberal. The issues of importance of tradition, parental expectations and the formation of Israel cause constant friction.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I got this movie out from Dambusters in Golders Green not knowing how good it was going to be. This film is a joy to watch from start to finish. The acting is superb and the script is great as well. The film provides an excellent drama between two Jewish guys one secular the other the son of a prominent frum Rabbi. Over the span of the film, you see their friendship develop and there are some real classic images of hassidic life including a Chassidic wedding. All the main actors play their part with real affection and dedication. Rod Steiger is in particular outstanding. This is all the more impressive given that guy was a non-jew.This film should have won Oscars. Ach, what do they know?</p>
