<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just like the title suggests, the film has two sides, 1942, a historic period and a love story. 1942, represents the time period when the Indians revolutionized against the British rulers for the freedom of the country, popularly know as "Quit India" movement. Many patriots sacrificed their lives during the freedom fight of the '40s. Under this backdrop, a beautiful love story has been weaved under a fabulous music of music maestro RD Burman. It was his last movie for which he won the coveted Filmfare awards for the best music director.The film remains commendable for three strong reasons. The first is obviously RD Burman's memorable music, which was unfortunately his last masterpiece. The songs like "Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To" or "Kuch Na Kaho.." remains the modern day classics. The songs get blended well with the beauty perpetuated through the superb cinematography. The lights and colors of the sets and the costumes all have a right touch for depicting the period. And the third nice aspect of the film remains the performances. Vidhu Vinod Chopra recasts Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff from his "Parinda" and they look good enough in their roles. Manisha Koirala adds beauty to the film and looks innocent. In the small roles, Raghuvir Yadav, Anupam Kher, Pran, Danny, Sushma Seth all play their roles perfect. Although the film saw some criticism and wasn't a very big success in the box office, the film is an iconic love story from '90s which has been made with an optimum care for which the film appears technically flawless.Rating: 3 stars out of 4</p>
