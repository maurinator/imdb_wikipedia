<h1>A Good Man in Africa (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Politics are already strained between English imperialists and the West African government of Kinjanja, when womanizing British diplomat Morgan Leafy (Colin Friels) is caught in bed with Celia (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), wife of corrupt Kinjanjan presidential candidate Sam Adekunle (Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr.). As punishment, Leafy is forced into bribing an official who has voted down a project that stands to make Adekunle very rich. Leafy thinks he's gotten off easy until he learns the lone holdout is none other than Kinjanja's own brick wall of integrity, Dr. Alex Murray (Connery). Meanwhile, Leafy must also contend with his absurdly stuffy boss Fanshawe (John Lithgow), Fanshawe's lusty wife (Diana Rigg) and their luscious, too friendly daughter!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well I just finished watching this movie and all I can say is that I had a fun time.  It's not your average kind of movie either. Not sure if they had intended it to be a funny movie but this movie does have some genuinely  funny moments.Also it has Sean Connery which I found rather surprising and being a Connery fan I stuck with the film to the end and it was well worth it.A Definite 6/10 from me.</p>
