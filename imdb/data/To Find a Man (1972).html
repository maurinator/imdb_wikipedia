<h1>To Find a Man (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The platonic friendship between two high school youths is explored through the attempts to get the girl an abortion. Her young male friend offers his support and tries to find her a doctor. She is grateful, but has trouble in expressing her thanks. At times funny, at other times touching, this is a refreshing, uncommon look at teenage friendship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Darren O'Conner is marvelous as a shy teenage boy who helps Pamela Sue Martin get an abortion.  The film is always completely realistic, glamorizing nothing, but never harsh or brutal.  Pamela Sue Martin is perfect as the self-absorbed young lady befriended by O'Connor.  Tom Ewell is surprisingly effective as the abortionist.  This is a terrific little-known gem that you will think about months after you have seen it.</p>
