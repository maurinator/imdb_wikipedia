<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film started off seeming a little bit tv-ish but turned out as a very watchable and slightly tongue-in-cheek thrill-ride. David Duchovny is very watchable and provides multiple sides of his lead character, a geeky surgeon, a down-and-out druggy, a hard-balled hero and a hopeless Romeo. Fighting for the love of Angelina Jolie as the sexy and good-natured mistress of Tim Hutton. Hutton has loads-a-fun as the hip and ultra-slick Mob boss, very almost unconvincingly evil, but not quite. Peter Stormare is underused and loud roles with screaming obscenities certainly aren't his scene, roles such as the one in "Fargo" suit his style alot better. The narration is well-used and Duchovny's voice is interesting as he explains his past, feelings, opinions. But unfortunately there's a point where his slightly mono-style voice gets a little too much. Still, he proves a solid lead and leads the film into a successful finale, ending a worth-while and overlooked Thriller from 1997.</p>
