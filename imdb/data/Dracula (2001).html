<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bad story with a crappy camera, wouldn't even watch it if it were on Cinemax.  Only thing good was the nudity and there was hardly any (except a lot of dancing and all bad lesbian sex)  Each actor sucked worse than the last and the only "Hi light" was that the hot Charlie showed her face (and more) in this crapfest...</p>
