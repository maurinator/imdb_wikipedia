<h1>Esa pareja feliz (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Good-for-nothing Juan marries Carmen to begin suffering what he thinks her and their friends' scorn at his proven inability to make a living, until he's lured to an apparent sound business that will for sure make them rich.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This brilliant satire on Spanish values and propaganda of the early fifties was the only film co-directed by Bardem and Berlanga when they left the national film school. It was actually made in 1951 but was not distributed until 1953, following the success of Â¡Bienvenido Mr Marshall! which they co-scripted.</p>
