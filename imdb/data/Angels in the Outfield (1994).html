<h1>Angels in the Outfield (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Roger, who has lost his mother, is living separated from his father. As he and his friend J.P. are one of the biggest fans of the Los Angeles baseball team he has got only two dreams: living together with a real family and let LA win the championship. As he is praying for these two things to happen some angels show up in order to help him - but he is the only one to see them and believe in them. Fortunately the coach of the baseball team sees his abilities and so LA has a run to the finals...</p>
<p>Roger Bomman lives in a foster home along with his best friend J.P., but when Roger's dad comes to visit him, a little bit of hope grows back into Roger's heart about him going to live with his dad. But his hopes suddenly die down when his dad says that they can be a family again when Roger's favorite baseball team, the California Angels, win the pennant, but the team is in last place in their division. So Roger prays to heaven and ask if the angels up there can help the Angels (baseball team) win the pennant so Roger can have the family that he always wanted, and because of his prayer, he just might.</p>
<p>The California Angels are currently the worst team in their division. It seems that the players have a little trouble with their teamwork. Manager George Knox would like nothing better than to dump all of them, which the owner says is impossible. Roger is a boy whose mother died and is currently living in a foster home. His father feels that it would probably be in Roger's best interest if he becomes a ward of the state. But Roger would rather that he and his father get back together, and when he asks his father if that is possible, his father's reply is "when the Angels win the pennant". Roger then prays and asks if they could help the team. When Roger goes to a game, he sees some angels come down from the sky and they help the players make some astounding catches and hits. When Roger tells Mr. Knox about it, Mr. Knox decides to keep him at every game, and it seems that Mr. Knox's faith is put to the test because it seems that the angels are going to help if he uses his worst players, but it seems to be working.</p>
<p>When a boy prays for a chance to have a family if the California Angels win the pennant, angels are assigned to make that possible.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on tape. I thought that this was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The movie has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger kids. The acting was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot line was not very believable, but the script was well written. This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans. It does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie. It directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film. Overall, the film was good, but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10.</p>
