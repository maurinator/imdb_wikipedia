<h1>Ruby Gentry (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Despite their different social class Ruby and Boake grew up together in the 1950s North Carolina. Ruby Corey lived with her poor family in the swamps while Boake Tackman lived in a mansion with servants. As long as their friendship stayed within the socially acceptable limits no one objected. In adulthood their friendship becomes a mutual romantic attraction. Ruby wants to marry Boake but he only seems interested in romantic play without commitment. Maybe conscious of his social status or maybe being afraid to offend his snobbish family and conservative hometown folk, he marries a rich girl. Out of revenge Ruby marries Jim Gentry, a recently widowed rich old man to whom many townsfolk and local businesses owe money. When Gentry dies in an accident, the town blames Ruby. A now rich Ruby takes revenge on the town's folk by calling in their debts and loans. The girl from the swamps has become the town's biggest nightmare.</p>

On the next morning, Jim apologizes with Ruby and they go sailing. However there is an accident and Jim drowns in the sea. Ruby is accused by the population of murdering Jim and she decides to revenge, using the money she inherited from Jim and foreclosing on the debts of the hometowns. But Ruby is still in love with Boake and her behavior will lead them to a tragedy.</p>
<p>A sexy but poor young girl marries a rich man she doesn't love, but carries a torch for another man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jennifer Jones certainly did not get type cast in her screen roles.As a complete contrast to her normal saintly image (Duel in the Sun excepted) she plays Ruby Gentry,a Sth.Carolina girl from the wrong side of the tracks who gets emotionally involved with Boake Tackman (Chalton Heston) her sometime aristocratic boyfriend who is promised (more as a property contract) to Tracy who comes from another good Sth.Carolina family.Ruby has a religous zealot brother who constantly harps on about "doom and gloom" if his sister carry's on her liaison with Boake.When Ruby realises she will not become Mrs Tackman she agrees to marry Jim Gentry -a working class local boy made good, played by Karl Malden, (funny how he always looks the same age in all his films no matter when they were filmed!).After a boating accident Jim dies and Ruby "cops the lot" arousing suspicion in the local town folk who knew Jim Gentry.There is nothing more scary than a woman scorned and when Boke rejects Ruby's last offer of money for marriage, she goes ballistic and purposely ruins his carefully cultivated fields he has reclaimed at great expense from nature but I will not divulge the ending.The poor old doctor does not press his suite enough but Ruby does not fancy him anyway. An interesting new role for JJ who certainly looks "the biz" in her tight fitting jeans!</p>
