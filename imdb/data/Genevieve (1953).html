<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's time for the annual London to Brighton antique car rally, and Alan McKim and Ambrose Claverhouse are not going to let their friendship stop them from trying to humiliate each other. Along the way, some old jealousies are kindled to the point where the two men decide to have a "friendly" wager on who will be the first back to London. Once the competitive juices get all fired up, however, it quickly becomes a nasty, hotly-contested affair. Ambrose's companion must suffer through her "maiden voyage" on the rally, while Mrs. McKim, on the other hand, is a long-time sufferer of her husband's obsession.</p>
<p>Two men race their vintage cars on the annual London to Brighton rally. "Genevieve" is the name of one of the cars, which, like her competitor, runs into one problem after another.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Such a classic in film history. Genevieve is a 1908 Darrack(car), the McKims are on there annaul Car Rally from London to Brighton, only this time on the way back to London, its a race against ex-friend Ambrose Claverhouse. Classic incidents in which form a race where anything goes will be firmly in your mind for ever. Dinah Sheridan plays an excellent Wendy who thinks its absolutely absurd bouncing around in these old cars. Kay Kendal plays the trumpet playing model Rosilind Peters who also thinks that its all getting rather silly, she has also bought her dog along for the ride. Kenneth More plays the sarcastic and terrible flirt Abrose who is determined to win. John Gregson plays the moody, long suffering and jealous Alan who also wants to win the race. I promise that this will have you in tears of laughter, a splendid film of a brilliant era of English film making, no film of this type has even come close. This is my favorite film, 5 out of 5.</p>
