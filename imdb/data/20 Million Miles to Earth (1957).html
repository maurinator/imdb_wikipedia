<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ray Harryhausen always wanted to film a monster movie in Europe and he got his chance with 20 Million Miles to Earth.A spacecraft returning from a trip to Venus crashes into the sea just off the coast of Italy.  Local fishermen rescue two of the occupants who are still alive just before it sinks.  One of them dies just after and the other is taken to a local hospital.  Then, a small boy finds a canister containing a strange jelly substance and takes it to a visiting circus to see what it is.  The owner of the circus takes charge of the jelly and a strange creature, the Ymir emerges from it.  The following day, the Ymir has grown into a giant and it escapes and goes on the rampage, eventually ending up in Rome.  The Military are called to try and capture it, but fail.  While in Rome, the Ymir is put in the zoo as a tourist attraction, but it escapes from there, fights and kills an elephant and climbs the Colosseum, where he gets shot down and killed.This is Harryhausen's personal favourite movie and he has a cameo appearance in the zoo sequence.  As well as the Ymir, the elephant is also done in stop-motion.The movie stars 50's sci fi regulars William Hopper (The Deadly Mantis) and Joan Taylor (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers).This movie is one the better monster movies of the 50's and one of my favourites.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</p>
