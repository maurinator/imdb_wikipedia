<h1>Chino (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chino Valdez is a loner horse breeder living in the old west. Partly a loner by choice, and partly because, being a 'half-breed', he finds himself unwelcome almost everywhere he goes. One day, a young runaway named Jimmy shows up at his door looking for work and a roof over his head. Reluctantly, Chino agrees to take him in and teach him the art of raising, breaking and breeding horses, until the pair finally begin to accept each other.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not Bronson's best effort, but not a total washout either. An often used storyline where the big rancher wants to take over the entire range, forcing out the little man. Things are made even more tense when the little man falls for the big man's sister. Except for a "Chato's Land" type shootout and a couple of fist and knife fights, there wasn't a lot of action, and the tale was somewhat holey. Question: Why does the man always burn his house down when he decides to vacate his frontier home? How is it that stone houses burn so good? Where did Chino get hay bales in 1870?</p>
