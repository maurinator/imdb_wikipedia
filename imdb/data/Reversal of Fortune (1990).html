<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Claus von Bulow was accused and convicted of twice attempting to kill his wife, Sunny von Bulow.  The film is about the appealNicholas Kazan takes a huge risk, and has Sunny von Bulow (Glenn Close, who is marvelous) narrate the story, while in a coma.  It pays off beautifully.  We learn the lifestyle in which they inhabit, there daily arguments about Claus' "extra-curricular" activities, work, etc.  In comes Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), who is hired by Claus to do the appeal.Fascinating and provocative, we see the way Ron Silver tries to find out if his client is guilty or innocent.  The cast is a treat to watch, down to even the smallest roles.  But it's Jeremy Irons who dominates with his chilling performance.By the end of the movie, we don't really care whether or not Claus is guilty, a testament to Barbet Schroeder, and Nicholas Kazan.</p>
