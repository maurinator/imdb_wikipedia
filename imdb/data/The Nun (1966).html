<h1>The Nun (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In eighteenth-century France a girl (Suzanne Simonin) is forced against her will to take vows as a nun. Three mothers superior (Madame de Moni, Sister Sainte-Christine, and Madame de Chelles) treat her in radically different ways, ranging from maternal concern, to sadistic persecution, to lesbian desire. Suzanne's virtue brings disaster to everyone in this faithful adaptation of a bitter attack on religious abuses by the Enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When "The Nun" was released in the US in 1971, the movie generated a lot of positive reviews. Anna Karina's performance was unanimously hailed as a great one. Judith Crist of New York Magazine called it "unforgettable." Archer Winsten of the New York Post described it as "superb". Gene Shalit dubbed Anna as "exceptional" while Kathleen Carroll of the New York Daily News thus enthused: "Anna Karina gives a performance of unusual depth". Indeed, Anna's interpretation is one of her best in a career of over 70 movies. It ranks with her performances in "Vivre sa Vie", "Pierrot le Fou", "Rendezvous a Bray", "L'Alliance" and "L'Etranger". She was reunited with Rivette in the musical "Haut Bas Fragile". She is slated to direct her second movie this year in Montreal, a road movie with the composer Philippe Katerine.</p>
