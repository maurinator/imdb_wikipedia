<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best movies on the French Revolution ever produced. Being a person well versed in the the period I was amazed at the level of detail.  The costumes are spot on.  Even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells, serving plates etc are all perfect.  As an American living in France who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance I can not over state how impressed I was with the visual accuracy of the film.The dialogue where known is virtual quotations and the where not recorded is in character.  I was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on DVD yet.  This is how historical drama should be done. Must see....</p>
