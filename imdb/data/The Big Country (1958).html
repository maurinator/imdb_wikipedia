<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Retired, wealthy sea Captain Jame McKay arrives in the vast expanse of the West to marry fianc√©e Pat Terrill. McKay is a man whose values and approach to life are a mystery to the ranchers and ranch foreman Steve Leech takes an immediate dislike to him. Pat is spoiled, selfish and controlled by her wealthy father, Major Henry Terrill. The Major is involved in a ruthless civil war, over watering rights for cattle, with a rough hewn clan led by Rufus Hannassey. The land in question is owned by Julie Maragon and both Terrill and Hannassey want it.</p>
<p>A New Englander arrives in the Old West, where he becomes embroiled in a feud between two families over a valuable patch of land.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There's just not one thing wrong with this movie.  The casting is perfect, as is the direction, cinematography, script, and music.  The score by Jerome Moross is perfection, and my personal favorite of all the great western movie scores.  All the actors/actresses are a perfect fit for their roles, and the male cast of Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors (who shines as the thoroughly bad Buck Hannassey) is ensemble acting at it's best.  Carol Baker and Jean Simmons are luminous, compelling, and strangely powerful.</p>
