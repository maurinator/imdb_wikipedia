<h1>The Monolith Monsters (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A strange black meteor crashes near the town of San Angelo and litters the countryside with fragments. When a storm exposes these fragments to water, they grow into skyscraper-sized monoliths which then topple and shatter into thousands of pieces that grow into monoliths themselves and repeat the process. Any humans in the way are crushed or turned into human statues. The citizens of San Angelo desperately try to save themselves and the world from the spreading doom.</p>
<p>Government geologist Dave Miller returns to his office in San Angelo to find it wrecked, strewn with black rocks along with his fellow geologist, Ben, dead, seemingly turned to stone. He can make little sense of it, nor can the local doctor diagnose what killed his colleague. When the Simpson farm is destroyed - also covered with the same black rocks - they find little Ginny Simpson as the only survivor. She too is afflicted, with her right hand turned to stone and spreading. When they transfer her to Los Angeles, Dave calls on his former professor, Arthur Flanders, who concludes the rock has to be a meteorite. What they soon learn is that the rocks grow when in contact with water - and the growing rocks are on a path directly to San Angelo, with only a few hours to find a way to stop them.</p>
<p>A meteorite strikes the California desert, dotting the surrounding terrain with strange rock formations which grow to gigantic sizes when in contact with water. Consequently, they turn any human or other living thing that comes into contact with them to stone through the absorption of all silicon therefrom. Mineralogist Dave Miller (Grant Williams) discovers that the only thing that stops the monoliths' growth is a saline solution - but who is going to salt them?</p>
<p>Rocks from a meteor which grow when in contact with water threaten a sleepy Southwestern desert community.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I always try to catch this movie when I can. When you run out of lizards and spiders and ants and octopus tentacles, is there another horror that you can unleash on the world. Yes, it's black rock crystals from outer space. At least I think they are black since the movie is in black and white. They grow fast, rise to an enormous height, and then fall over, crushing everything in their path. This sounds so stupid, yet the movie isn't all that bad. There is the obligatory scientist, the police officer, the young woman, and the small town in the path. What can they do? Can they outwit these rocks? As is usually the case, there is something that these things are vulnerable to. Now, can we deliver the goods and stop them. I have so much affection for these B science fiction movies that I just can't help myself. One thing about this one is that it has never been copied. Maybe it's time for Peter Jackson to do the new Monolith Monsters.</p>
