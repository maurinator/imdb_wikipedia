<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What can I say, a sad ending to a thrilling trilogy!  This movie DESPERATELY needed Kevin Williamson's touch, and boy ,does it show!  From the previews, trailers, hype,etc; it states: "ALL BETS ARE OFF, BECAUSE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A TRILOGY!"  UTTER GARBAGE!  You would think the final piece in this puzzle would knock your socks off, and jarr your cerebrum.  No, all you get are: Bad dialogue, Unknown actors getting killed, a deja vu itis, a bored Neve Campbell and equally BORING! Killer, but the most unforgivable crime is to give the audience a completely redundant explanation for all the previous + present killings!  For a movie of this caliber(that isn't saying much), to end in such a wishy-washy way is in a word, CRAP!  Now the ending may be forgivable, as I've heard that there were 3 endings made, and ,if Wes is smart, will release each of them randomly into the theaters.  We can only pray, they'll be in the DVD version!Not to say, I completely hated this movie's guts, it just needed more 'oomph' that only Kevin could've wrote.  Scenes with Dewey, Gale, and, yes, Parkey Posey added a nice comedic element in between the "yawn" scary scenes, Cameos including Jenny McCarthy were wonderful, but needed more screen time and dialogue, and the "blast of the past" scenes were done well. All in all, though, a terrible way to end an enjoyable trilogy, and hopefully, SCREAM 3 will be re-released as a DIRECTOR'S CUT!PEACE AND OUT!</p>
