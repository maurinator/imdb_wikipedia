<h1>Element of Doubt (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A woman has doubts about the intentions of her husband, even to the point where she thinks he might kill her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Unpredictable and quite scary horror/thriller, clearly inspired by Hitchcock's "Suspicion". An exciting story, superb acting and distinct direction highlights this inspiring tale of terror. My verdict: 7 out of 10.</p>
