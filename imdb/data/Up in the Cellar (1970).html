<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>1960's period piece. Strictly a snapshot of late 60's culture, made in the haphazard style that was briefly popular in the late 60's-early 70's. Of course it is irreverent- but I really don't see any relevance. It is yet another 1960's attempt to present mere irreverence as something relevant, but it wasn't relevant then, and isn't now.However, when I saw this film in a theater in 1970 I laughed out loud, as did most of the audience. Laughed despite viewing the worst film actor I have ever seen (Wes Stern) and nothing from actress Nira Barab. The plus factor is Larry Hagman, who is energetic, extremely charismatic and funny. Joan Collins is good here too.I would like to watch this movie again if they could edit out Wes Stern, but unfortunately he is in too many of the scenes.As far as 1970-era culture, this movie won't make us nostalgic for those days but can only serve as a time capsule.</p>
