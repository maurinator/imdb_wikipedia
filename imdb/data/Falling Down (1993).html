<h1>Falling Down (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the day of his daughter's (Joey Hope Singer) birthday, William "D-Fens" Foster (Michael Douglas) is trying to get to his estranged ex-wife's (Barbara Hershey) house to see his daughter. He has a breakdown and leaves his car in a traffic jam in Los Angeles and decides to walk. Along the way he stops at a convenience store and tries to get some change for a phone call but the owner, Mister Lee (Michael Paul Chan), does not give him change. This destabilizes William who then breaks apart the shop with a baseball bat and goes to an isolated place to drink a coke. Two gangsters (Agustin Rodriguez & Eddie Frias) threaten him and he reacts by hitting them with the bat. D-FENS continues walking and stops at a phone booth. The gangsters hunt him down with their gang and shoot at him but crash their car. William goes nuts and takes their gym bag with weapons proceeding in his journey of rage against injustice. Meanwhile Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall), who is working on his last day before retirement, is following the wave of crimes and believes that the same man is responsible but the other detectives do not pay attention to him.</p>
<p>It is a sweltering summer day in Los Angeles and a man (known only by his car registration: D-Fens) is stuck in his car in an early-morning traffic jam. It is his daughter's birthday and his only aim is to see her on her special day. Abandoning his car in the traffic he sets out to get to the house of his ex-wife to see his daughter. Along the way he meets all manner of obstacles, causing his pent-up frustration at the hindrances and absurdities of life and cynicism and criminality of average people to boil over. What follows is a peaceful man's violent odyssey, an odyssey to see his daughter.</p>
<p>William (D-FENS) Foster (Michael Douglas) just wants to get home to see his daughter (Joey Hope Singer) on her birthday. Unfortunately, nothing seems to be going right for him.

D-FENS begins to crack and starts to fight back against the every day "injustices" he encounters on his journey home. The film has a story running in parallel about Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall); a desk-bound cop who is about to retire. He's retiring for his wife's (Tuesday Weld) sake, and obviously isn't happy about it. The cop tracks down D-FENS and in the final scene.....</p>

Soon he finds himself in gangland, and deals with some tough-looking gang members ('Agustin Rodriguez' & Eddie Frias) by attacking them and running them off. When the gang members try to retaliate, it fails when they crash their car and D-FENS takes their bag full of guns. Unfortunately for him, Detective Predergrast (Robert Duvall) retiring cop is on his trail, and soon things will come to blows as D-FENS heads towards Venice for his young daughter's (Joey Hope Singer) birthday party....</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Joel Schumacher's Falling Down is really an under-rated film.  Michael Douglas gives his best performance yet as a middle aged man who is now gone completely insane.  I compare it to American Beauty and George Carlin because basically that is what this is.  A regular guy who's had enough of life (and goes around lecturing people about how life for him sucks). Still, Schumacher, Douglas and co-star Robert Duvall try their best and succeed with perfect precision.  One of the best films of 1993.</p>
