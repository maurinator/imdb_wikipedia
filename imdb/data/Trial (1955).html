<h1>Trial (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of a murder trial where a Mexican boy is accused of the death of a Caucasian girl. The two-faced attorney (Arthur Kennedy) who takes the boy's case is only interested in defending him so he can exploit his Communist-backed organization for their own underhanded purposes. He and his organization bring in an idealistic law professor (Glenn Ford) who agrees to represent the boy in court.</p>
<p>A law professor, David Blake, will not have his teaching contract renewed as he has no courtroom experience whatsoever. He has the summer to rectify that and after visiting several law firms, is offered a position by lawyer Barney Castle. Together they pursue the case of Angel Chavez, a young Hispanic lad who has been charged with murdering a white girl at a private beach. Barney sets out to raise money for a defense fund while handing the court room work to David. He soon realizes that Angel is not guilty and Barney stages a huge rally to raise money. It's there that David realizes that Barney is a Communist, raising funds as much for the Party as for Angel's defense. In fact, Barney is out to create race hatred and social instability and if anything, wants Angel to be found guilty.</p>
<p>Courtroom drama set in 1947 and underlying post-WW2 acute problems facing the USA such as stormy race relations and the growing threat of local communism.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film fascinates precisely BECAUSE of its confused treatment of the theme of bigotry. It does not only refer, under a thin disguise of name, to Senator McCarthy - but also to the Ku Klux Klan. To me, its chief value is that it illustrates rather startlingly the ethical strangeness of a mid-fifties America apparently seeking a definition of justice while still beset with considerable self-doubt concerning its own institutions.Few films of the period make so explicit the names of the antagonists; that is what sets it apart.On the level of pure melodrama, it is entertaining, fast-paced and convincingly acted. The opening scene suggests an erotically-charged no man's land, namely the beach community of San Juno, anno 1947. This is the scene that I think will remain in my memory, because it precedes all the rhetoric, legalistic and otherwise, which never quite connects with the reality of spontaneous behaviour - simply, groping in the dark.</p>
