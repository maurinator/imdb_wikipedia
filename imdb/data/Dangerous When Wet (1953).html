<h1>Dangerous When Wet (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The health conscious, dairy-farming Higgins family begin each day with an invigorating swim. One day, traveling health-tonic salesman, Windy Weebe, comes to town and suggests they could swim the English Channel. Sponsored by "Liquapep" and coached by Windy, the family arrive in Europe. There it is decided that daughter Katie is the only one strong enough to enter the contest. But while she should be focused on the difficult and risky task ahead, Katie is pursed by dashing Frenchman, Andr√© Lanet... This comedic musical is well remembered for the scene when Katie dreams she is swimming with cartoon characters Tom & Jerry!</p>
<p>A young woman enters a contest to be the first to swim the English Channel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A farm family from Arkansas is tapped to swim in a race across the English Channel as part of a health drink promotional campaign. MGM musical isn't smothered with the usual studio-gloss, and Esther Williams is spunky and likable, but the plot is still pretty thin. Esther's on-screen romance with Fernando Lamas generated sparks off-screen (they were soon married in real-life), yet only a smidgen of this chemistry makes it into the movie. It is probably best remembered for the wonderful dream sequence wherein Williams swims with various cartoon characters, including Tom and Jerry. Not too bad: **1/2 from ****</p>
