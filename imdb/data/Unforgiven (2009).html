<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Absolutely outstanding drama mine series. Best piece of TV I have seen for quite a long time. Really shows what can be done as long as the story is good enough and the actors are up for the job - there are several incredibly good performances here. Suranne Jones is fantastic in the lead role and Matthew McNulty also really stands out - but generally everyone puts in top drawer performances. The last episode has a bit more action in it than the first two but it continues to build on the story and doesn't let anything else get in the way. The ending is very, very touching as well and it is a brilliant way to conclude the series. Overall 10 out of 10 and a huge thumbs up to British ITV.</p>
