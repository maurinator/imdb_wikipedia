A mighty thunderstorm blows him clean off the map, and spits him out far away over the lush green town of Clarence. In this new town, he rockets into the world of Glenda, the town's only parking cop. While the media back home becomes obsessed with the story of his disappearance, Danny gets to reinvent himself in this new town, and in his great adventure, he discovers a true soulmate in Glenda. Fate catches up with him eventually, as Danny's true identity is revealed and Trudy--now a tabloid celebrity--comes to the idyllic town to claim Danny and drag him back to Sydney. Danny, however, is a changed man; he's discovered what it means to be happy and has found a new self-worth. Saying farewell to Trudy, Danny makes a dynamic re-entry to the town of Clarence--determined to win Glenda back again and embrace his newfound zest for life.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked the plot about Danny Deckchair, so I just had to check it out. I expected a comedy filled of nonstop joking, but hey! It turned out to be a more romantic entertainer than I thought - in a good way! With no well known actors, this movie treats some of the most everyday subjects in life - love and career - with such perfect precision. The balance between love and comedy is close to perfect, but I feel that some more jokes or crazy excursions would have been welcome. Danny is the true king! Haven't you seen it yet and feel for something to see together with your heart of love, check this one out for real! 6/10, since I think it lacked more jokes, but judging the art of romance here, it's a pure 9.</p>
