<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know how other's comments on awful acting can be justified. On the two occasions that I saw this film on television I found it gripping. The emotion that the girl shows in the film is clearly meant to be shock and not bad acting - only in over the top Hollywood acting do women get completely taken over by hysteria for the majority of the film.This is not a standard horror or action film and the tension builds as the nature of the film changes from observance of a scientific study, to the observance of several disasters, to a chilling conclusion.Those who want a cerebral, plot and dialogue based, tense and suspense-filled thriller will probably love this film. For those who find this isn't their cup of Tea - I hope you enjoy watching Freddy Vs Jason.</p>
