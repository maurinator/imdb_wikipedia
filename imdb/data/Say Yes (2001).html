<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Upset with the idea of having to move out because her building is going co-op, Carrie faces an even bigger problem: Aidan suggested that they move in together after he bought both Carrie's and the next door apartment to make one big place for them. It's a big step that needs some thinking time, which is not helped when Carrie accidentally discovers an engagement ring among Aidan's stuff. This makes her question if Aidan is really "the one" and if she is ready for it. But then again, are we ever ready? An unexpected bump into Big doesn't really help her, especially when the ring she saw has nothing to do with her  never mind that it was Miranda who helped him pick it out. Finally, when she's not expecting, Aidan kneels and pops the question. The right timing, the right place  and most important, the right ring  make Carrie say yes. Meanwhile, Miranda faces a proposal too, after she tells Steve she's pregnant with his child. But, unlike Carrie, Miranda is definitely not ready for marriage  especially with a secondhand ring  and so they decide to raise the kid together, but separated. Samantha flies off to Rio with her new boss and doesn't wait long before entering the mile-high club, while Charlotte anticipates herself and enrolls to adopt a Mandarin baby.This episode can be summed up into four words:Proposals,Marriage,Moving In,and Adoption.We get to see Aiden propose to Carrie to move in and she thinks about it.But later,she accepts it when he did it at the right place,the right time and the right ring.It was also an engagement that she did not foresee that Aiden would do.Steve proposes to Miranda upon learning that she is pregnant.She says no upon seeing an second hand ring and doing it at the wrong place and at the wrong time.This would definitely serve as an eye-opener to viewers who want to get engaged in the near future.Also,we get to see the issue of adoption particularly in the case of that of Charlotte.Overall,we get to see the issues of four words mentioned above.</p>
