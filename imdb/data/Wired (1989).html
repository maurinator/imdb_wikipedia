<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>and I have seen a lot of films.  I saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day I remember the sickening urge to walk out.  If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of the cinema-- this film has nothing to offer you.  It is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward.  As we see the progression of Belushi's life pass on the screen, Woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character.  The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters "Breathe for me, Woodward."  There are too many terrible things to mention them all, the least of which is the opening that has Belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named "Angel."  I'll leave it at that.</p>
