<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The discovery" (In Chaplin's block) director Hans Abramson sublimates his need for sex and drugs in an exploration of childhood. The drama is set in London at # 3 Pownall Terrace , where Charles Chaplin spent his childhood. A slum neighborhood where the Music Hall tradition lives on, carried out by some singing and dancing girls. In Jörn Donners "He She" a loving couple in a hotel room makes thorough hygienic preparations for having sex. This foreplay take so long that there is no time for lovemaking. A sprawling collection of short films that never manage to fit in under the title of "Stimulantia". Somewhere along the way this proud and unusual project drove in the ditch. However a must for Swedish film buffs.</p>
