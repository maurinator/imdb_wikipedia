<h1>All Over the Guy (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"All Over The Guy" is a contemporary romantic comedy about the quest to find the "one" when "the one" doesn't know he's the "one." It explores the unlikely pairing of two 20-somethings thrown together by their respective best friends in hopes of igniting their own romance. They do everything they can to NOT fall in love, but finally they overcome the dysfunction of their parents and surrender to their hearts.</p>
<p>Eli and Tom are successfully featured in this movie as two meant-to-be lovers. The movie is mostly flashbacks recounting the moments where each of the individuals' friends take turns to pair them up. Tom having emotionally-distant alcoholic parents and Eli hailing from a pair of Jewish psychiatric who taught him to be emotionally open, making him neurotic, couldn't make the two further apart. Surprisingly or fortunately, despite the two different guys, the two individually believe in finding the one and it takes a blind date from Jackie and Brett who believe in their match. An interesting match-up between the two, from two very different backgrounds will keep you glued especially with the touch of comedy, the sarcasm of the two and their involved friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this movie last night for the second time, and I got to say that I really enjoyed it.  Like a lot of reviewers have said here, it's nice to see two gay men viewed in the true representation of their lives.  I mean come on, who really wants to be like their parents.  These two guys came together and brought so much garbage with them that they couldn't see each other and the love that they had for each other.I really don't have that much to say about this film, except that I truly enjoyed it and I would watch it again anytime.  Oh and by the by, I've seen Richard Ruccolo on the street once, and trust me, he is that handsome, in every sense of the word.Rent It!!!!!! You won't be sorry.</p>
