<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie definitely wasn't as good as the first one.I thought the original was actually quite entertaining and had quite a good story.This didn't have an as good story and some parts seemed silly.I didn't like the fact that it was the male astronaut doing all the killing instead of Sil.And that is was in Washington D.C instead of L.A. But the action scenes still entertained me and the monsters were pretty cool.I don't know how they got Michael Madsen and the now famous Marg Helenberger to do this sequel ( and I don't know they got Madsen to do the first one either) but there acting was good.Overall I think was a reasonably entertaining movie but don't out of your way to see it.</p>
