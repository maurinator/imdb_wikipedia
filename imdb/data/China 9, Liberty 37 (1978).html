<h2> Summaries </h2>

Matthew, still alive, and mad as hell joins Clayton's equally angered employers to hunt down the pair</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the few (only?) westerns where sex is the main motivator, a wonderful spaghetti western with Fabio Testi and Jenny Agutter, with Warren Oates and a rare performance by Sam Peckingpaugh.  An important film in the ouvre of Monte Hellman, quintessential 70's cult director; a man who has made more great films than Coppola yet remains mostly unknown in his home country. See "Two-Lane Blacktop," "Cockfighter," and "The Shooting."</p>
