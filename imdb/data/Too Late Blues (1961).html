<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Unconventional Hard Hitting Slice of Jazz Musician Life from Edgy Director Cassavetes, who Always Seemed as Nervous as His Films. The Second Film from the Adversed to the Studio System Auteur was Made Within and as Such the Director Never Thought Much of it.It was Done at a Strange Time in Pop Culture. Race Relations and Integration were Percolating and Hollywood was Mostly Late to the Struggle Usually Steering Way Away from Anything Provocative or Controversial. Cassavetes Seems to be In Their Face Right-Off with an Opening Scene that Literally Fills the Wide Screen with the Black Faces of Children Contrasted to the White Jazz Group. The Script Also Makes More than One Reference to Interracial Relationships, Dope, and Prostitution. Bobby Darin is Fine as a Songwriter/Piano Player who Leads the Combo, but it Never Seems in the Right Direction. Stella Stevens is Also Superb in a Teary Role as an Insecure Singer with a Killer Body.The Movie's Narrative is Not Very Tight and Motivations are At Times Lacking but the Film has an Offbeat, Gritty Style Among its Perfect Hair and Shiny Suites with Skinny Ties. It was Not a Hit and the Director Scurried from Hollywood and Nobody Seemed to Care. He wasn't Meant to Be There Anyway.Overall, Worth a Watch to See what John Cassavetes did Within the System and to See Bobby Darin's Acting and Stella Stevens' Range. The Story is Real and Rough and a Movie that was Removed from Just About Anything in 1961.</p>
