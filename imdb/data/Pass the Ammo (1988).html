<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie. I really loved the character who played "Bubba". Can you tell me anything about him? I think his name would have been listed in the credits but I could never find it. A must rent for the gang to enjoy most on any movie night. I am a big fan of fan Bill Paxton and I love him in this movie. I am surprised that he has not gotten more roles like this. This movie was a all-star cast of unknowns at the time, but as history has bore out, they are all stars in their own right. I have never been to Arizona to where this movie was filmed, but I am planning a vacation there to see where they filmed this movie soon. Anthony Geary was amazing also. Just love this flick so very much.</p>
