<h1>The Projected Man (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A scientist experimenting with matter transmission from place to place by means of a laser beam suddenly decides to use himself as a test specimen. But the process goes awry, and one side of his body becomes hideously deformed and instantly lethal to anyone it touches.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Boring English horror/sci-fi about a boring scientist who wants to project matter through space, a la Andre Delambre in "The Fly". Unfortunately, this backfires and said scientist becomes an ugly mutant with the touch of death... I guess. I really wasn't paying attention. Even on MST3K you may need to bring the caffeine pills.</p>
