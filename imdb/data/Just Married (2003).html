They still get married and fly to Europe for a romantic honeymoon Tom can't afford. Their love gets tested dangerously by misfortune of technical and other kinds all the way. Worse, Peter catches up with them on a mission to 'make Sars sees sense' just when the newly weds are furious at each-other.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>so i dont really understand why brittany would have done this movie, since it all was a corny idea and wasnt that funny to get it into the comedy category. in the movie, she and ashton are from two different social backgrounds and fall crazily in love and then just get married. so after all this, the parents oh course disapprove, and were hoping that brittany would marry a richer man.  they dont say this in too many words, but you can see the aspect of that during the movie. i wasnt blessed to see the movie in the cinema, but if i did, i would have walked out. ashton should really give up the teenage acting, and perhaps stick with what made him this famous, no not demi moore, but acting gigs that are funny, like the 70's show. since he is deciding to hang out with a more mature crowd, he should act the role. after all, he is an actor!
