<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First I must say that I prejudged this movie as an idiotic pile of c***.  How could anyone create such filth?(I got all this from the previews).  But I was stunned when I caught this film on television one day, because I liked it in all respects.  There have only been a couple of movies that I have judged so harshly without seeing them and was enthralled by them and Drop Dead Fred was one of them.  This movie was hilarious but it was more then just that.  A lot of people did not understand this movie because they were searching in the shallow waters and never dove deep into the meaning of it.  Fred may or may not be a figment of Phoebe Cates imagination, that is left for the viewer to decide.  He was obnoxious, he was mean and selfish, but was their any other way to portray him?  Cute and cuddly maybe?  Sweet and likeable?  Now that would have annoyed me.  Fred was a troublemaker, he was the wild, uncontrollable child in Phoebe Cates.  He represented the ounce of child left in her. This movie was made to show that adults abandon the child within to live a bore of a life.  This adult was portrayed in Cate's mother to contrast with her character.  People who deny their inner child can never live an entirely fulfilling life.  Rick Mayall did an incredible job as Drop Dead Fred.  Without him, the movie would not have survived.  But everyone else in the movie did a great job too.  This movie is very enjoyable-watch it with an open mind.</p>
