<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was a little skeptical of Spy Kids 3-D because I wasn't sure what the filmmakers were going for. Instead of the usual 3-D films of today, which are mostly boring large screen pseudo-documentaries, or specialized environment theme park rides,: Spy Kids 3-D is a compelling franchise that the whole family can enjoy with added dimension that makes it even more exciting. Even though the film was theatrically presented in eye straining anaglyph format (red and blue), which, to date, is the most cost effective for a mass theater release and shot on a 24p 3-D High Def system (VIDEO) introduced by James Cameron, I found myself immersed enough in the story and just having fun with the genre to not really care. After all, I wasn't expecting James Bond. It's `Spy Kids' for crying out loud and they got away with it!!! Richard Rodriguez combined all elements of HD-making in a smart and acceptable way. Leave it to a cannonball gorilla HD-maker to get it done thank god Miramax is here to let filmmakers actually create and controltheir own films with promise for distribution!! As a 3-D aficionado, I am hoping to see the movie in all its true-to-color and full 3-D glory one day as a polarized release or a well-mastered DVD release for virtual reality shutter glasses. To sum it all up.Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is more than an experience; it's a milestone in history that will start a new revolution in 3-D Filmmaking. Kudos to Richard Rodriguez and James Cameron to a great start.</p>
