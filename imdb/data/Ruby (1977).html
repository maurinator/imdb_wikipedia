<h1>Ruby (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sixteen years after Ruby Claire's gangster boyfriend was shot and killed by four associates, a series of gruesome murders takes place at the drive-in movie theatre she now owns. Meanwhile, the behaviour of her mute daughter Leslie is becoming increasingly strange and a visiting psychic claims that forces from beyond are out for revenge.</p>
<p>In 1935, a lowlife mobster, Nicky Rocco, is betrayed and executed in the swampy backwoods as his pregnant gun-moll, Ruby Claire, watches. He swears vengeance with his dying breath, and then she suddenly goes into labour. In 1951, Ruby runs a backwoods drive-in theatre, employes some ex-mobsters, and has a 16-year-old daughter, Leslie Clair, who had been mute since birth. Bizarre accidents claim the lives of one employee after another. Then Leslie shows strange behavior, and then begins to speak...in her dead father's voice. A demonic, perverted Nicky Rocco possesses the girl's body and terrorizes Ruby with levitations, telekinesis, maniacal laughing, and bizarre sexual aggression.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite a multitude of minor blemishes, RUBY stands as an effectually devised psychological/supernatural chiller which gainsays its deficient funding.Piper Laurie turns out an impressive performance as Ruby, a hard-drinking harlot in ownership of a weatherbeaten old drive-in movie theater. In years past, she was a knockout gangster's moll whose man was murdered gangland style. Before he died, he vowed to return from the grave...a promise which, it seems, he has kept.A cleverly formulated B quickie thick with gloom and disquietude, RUBY is an honorable short-order undertaking which emanates a pleasingly differential mood of foreboding creepiness.6/10</p>
