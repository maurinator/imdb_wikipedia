<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After reading the other reviews I can say what some may not like about this film makes it a hit for me. Great soundtrack and musical score. Awesome effects and stunts. This film swings back and forth from near stillness to total pandemonium. It is agreeably disconcerting. Predicting the next scene is impossible. A survival movie of 5 stars. I concur this film has a strange quality, even exotic. Everything about Silent Trigger is excellent, including the acting. I really liked the set design. You might like this movie less if you need a visible plot and an even pace (it's not here!). Silent Trigger would be good in a trio including, say, The Anderson Tapes (Sean Connery and Dyan Cannon) and The Peacemaker (George Clooney and Nicole Kidman), because of the contrast and similarities in all three films. At any rate it would seem to be a film that could use a balance, because it does have a slice factor. So my advice is to pair it with a few other films and round out your viewing.</p>
