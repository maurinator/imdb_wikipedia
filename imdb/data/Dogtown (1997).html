<h1>Dogtown (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Philip Van Horn, who left his small town a long time ago to become a Hollywood actor and hasn't had any success at that, returns to the town for a visit. There he is uniformally met like some kind of celebrity and movie star. He uses it to impress his (and everybody's) school love Dorothy, her life now a grey boring experience.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not much to say about this film, other than mentioning Karen Black's fine cameo. She gets a chance to sing and act typically Karen - - the wacky mother/aunt role in a small Southern town that she's done too many times in the past 10-15 years. Give this woman the role she deserves! Maybe Steve Balderson's "Firecracker" really will be the comeback role some people are saying it is. Also, interesting to note is this film's young star, Trevor St. John, has become quite the fan favorite of daytime, as he is now starring on ABC's "One Life To Live". A few other interesting folks pop up like Mary Stuart Masterson and Jon Favreau, but most entertaining is Natasha Gregson Wagner as the mentally challenged daughter of Karen Black's character. She plays the character exactly how you would imagine any child raised by a Karen Black character - totally whacked out!</p>
