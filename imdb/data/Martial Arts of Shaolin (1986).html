<h1>Martial Arts of Shaolin (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jet Li weasels out of the north Shaolin temple to assassinate a despotic ruler at the ruler's extravagant public birthday celebration. Two other men from the south Shaolin temple also set out to assassinate the ruler, but all three fail and are chased all over by soldiers. Meanwhile, one of the southerners turns out to be a cross-dressed woman, who is also discovered to wear a footbell to match Jet Li's, meaning they are somehow slated for an arranged marriage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is packed with fighting from beginning to end. Jet Li is as always very impressive and so are all the other actors (in their fighting, that is). The acting isn't very good, though(not that i know any Chinese). The actors sound like babies shouting to each other and the evil guy's laugh is unbeatable. I like the Amiga-sounding sound effects, though, and the theme song just sticks to you're brain like glue on paper. There is also some nice scenery. I love this movie.</p>
