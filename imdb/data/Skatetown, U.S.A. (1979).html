<h1>Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At a roller disco competition, two rivals find themselves becoming good friends while competing for a prize of $1000 in cash.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really wish they would release this on DVD. You gotta love those late 70's early 80's movies about Rollerskating. If you liked Rollerboogie, you'll love this! It's not a work of art, but it's a lot of fun, especially if you grew up in that time period. If anything it's fun to laugh at and say, "I really liked this crap?" How can you beat the all star cast of Scott Baio, Maureen McCormick, and that blonde guy who "acted" with Scott Baio as the jerky jock in Zapped. If you loved the 70's and afterschool specials, I highly suggest (if they ever release this) to give it a viewing. You'll laugh, you'll cry (that your actually having fun watching it), and it just might become your favorite movie about late 70's Rollerdisco.</p>
