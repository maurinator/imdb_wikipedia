<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1944, in eastern part of China, U.S.Army Major Baldwin and his volunteer team of demolition engineers are left behind the retreating Chinese forces. Their task is to slow down the Japanese advance into eastern China by blowing up bridges, roads, airfields and munitions dumps. They start by blowing up an American airfield and ammo dump. They receive the order to destroy a vital bridge over a mountain pass.The team uses a few army trucks to move around. At the bridge, they encounter a Nationalist Chinese Army unit in charge of guarding the bridge. Thanks to an American soldier who speaks some Chinese, Major Baldwin requests the permission, from the Chinese commander, to blow up the bridge.The Chinese colonel agrees but asks the American Major to do him a favor by also destroying a munitions dump located at some distance away.He also requests that Madame Sue-Mei Hung, the widow of a Chinese colonel, be transported by the American demolition team to the nearest major town. Major Baldwin is reluctant to be responsible for the woman's life but he reluctantly agrees to transport her, in the name of Chinese-American war cooperation.Since the ammo dump is on the way, Major Baldwin also agrees to destroy it, at the request of the Chinese commanders. The Chinese dispatch Colonel Kwan to serve as liaison officer and translator with the American demolition team. Colonel Kwan also carries stamped orders from the Chinese commanders for any Chinese forces they might encounter on the way.Thus assembled, the demolition team of Major Baldwin commences its dangerous journey toward its objectives.With the Japanese forces advancing at a rapid pace, the team doesn't have much time at its disposal to achieve its goals. To make matters worse, the demolition team discovers that local Chinese folk, Chinese refugees and Chinese bandits roaming the region can be as much of a threat as the invading Japanese forces.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Legendary American reporter Theodore H. White covered China in the 1940s, and he wrote the novel on which this unusual James Stewart feature is based. It's not quite anti-war, but it's a very long way from the flag-waving military movies that Stewart made in the 1950s.Stewart's character is a U.S. military engineer working with a small team trying to slow a Japanese advance in China. Though there's plenty of action (especially explosions), the emphasis is on the Americans' interaction with their Chinese allies -- which is fraught with problems. Stewart's character has a local love interest, played by Lisa Lu, but their relationship is nothing like a conventional GI romance."The Mountain Road" was obviously meant to be a thought-provoking look back at World War II, and to audiences in the early 1960s it probably was. The climax may have been almost shocking. In today's more jaded world, the movie is likely to strike many viewers as dull, with an ending that resolves very little. But it you still have a rose-colored view of the "Greatest War," and think it was less morally messy than our current conflicts, this could be enlightening.</p>
