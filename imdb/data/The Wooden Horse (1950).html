<h1>The Wooden Horse (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a POW camp, the Nazis have placed the huts far from the boundary so that any escape tunnel would have to be a long one. One British officer has the idea of starting a daily gynmastics routine using a vaulting horse: they can place it near the boundary and start a tunnel from under it. He and two others do escape the camp by this means and plan to make for neutral Sweden. To do that, they'll not only have to move around without arousing any suspicions, but also find a stranger from a neutral or occupied country who'll be willing and able to help them.</p>
<p>True story of three British POWs and their attempt to escape from Nazi Germany.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Wooden Horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British POW's during World War II.  It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues Leo Genn.  Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes.  The direction is taut and fast-moving throughout.  Highly Recommended.</p>
