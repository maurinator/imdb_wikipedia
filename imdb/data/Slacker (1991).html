<h1>Slacker (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Presents a day in the life in Austin, Texas among its social outcasts and misfits, predominantly the twenty-something set, using a series of linear vignettes. These characters, who in some manner just don't fit into the establishment norms, move seamlessly from one scene to the next, randomly coming and going into one another's lives. Highlights include a UFO buff who adamantly insists that the U.S. has been on the moon since the 1950s, a woman who produces a glass slide purportedly of Madonna's pap smear, and an old anarchist who sympathetically shares his philosophy of life with a robber.</p>
<p>A day in the life of Austin, Texas as the camera roams from place to place and provides a brief look at the overeducated, the social misfits, the outcasts and the oddballs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with the other people who have praised this film, it is terrific. I also own a copy and find that I seldom make it all the way through.  Still I keep it and periodically go back to it because I can't wait for a particular character to show up or to be reminded of one that I'd forgotten.  And best of all....I think that I've known most of these people at some time in my life!  As bizarre as all of these characters are they are very much like some of the wackos everybody encounters throughout their lifetime. Linklater did a very good job of his caricatures and drew excellent performances out of his cast.</p>
