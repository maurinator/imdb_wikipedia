But the woman's ex husband comes up with an idea: he asks some professional hang gliders to help get him into the fortress and rescue them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is certainly not as great as a James Bond action film. It is a very good movie with a simple plot. It has a wonderful cast and a great outdoor location for the major action scenes. Not a spoiler, just pay attention when action starts. Do watch closely when a helicopter scene begins. You will see James Coburn doing a real scary stunt hanging from under the helicopter. Not a stuntman doing the job. Also close your eyes when Coburn speaks and ask yourself if it is Leonard Nemoy. They have the same voice. This is well worth seeing. It is not real dumb. It also is not an educational film. No nudity or gore. James Coburn is the main attraction here. There are very nice aerial shots. The stunt hang glider pilots are very skilled.</p>
