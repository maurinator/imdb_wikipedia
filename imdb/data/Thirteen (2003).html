<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think we have all known a girl like evie.she's the type that you could drop her in any city'school or area in America, and she will hit the ground running and be THE popular wild girl everyone wants and lusts after and who everyone wants to hang around.no matter where she moves, she will become the in crowd. I think the movie captured the essence of that type of girl perfectly. she really is an interesting character.bad girl,YET because she can be so engaging she disarms immediatlly. notice how evie goes against the usual bad girl type cast by doing little odd things such as happily and in a very friendly way offers her new friends nerdy friend a slice of pizza.see the duo faces of the girl?her beauty and sweetness out of the blue knock people off guard allowing her to pretty much run riot in any situation and get away with it.hard to believe the actress who played her also had a hand in the script.so young.but she is headed for big things, if not in the acting dept,most likely the writing.</p>
