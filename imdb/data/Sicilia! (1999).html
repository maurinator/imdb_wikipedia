<p>A Sicilian that emigrated to the United States of America fifteen years ago return to his hometown in Sicily to visit his mother. He has conversations with a orange picker in the train station and then with another passenger in the train. When he meets his mother, she discloses revelations about his childhood and her sentimental life. Last he has a small talk with a knife-sharpener."Sicilia!" is a boring movie about the homecoming of a man after many years living abroad. Along his journey back home, the situation of the unsophisticated Sicily is disclosed through his conversations with his countrymen. This low-budget black and white film might be interesting for people from Sicily or from First World Countries, but I found it dull and painful to watch. This movie was released in Brazil on VHS by Cult Films Distributor. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Gente da Sic√≠lia" ("People of the Sicily")</p>
