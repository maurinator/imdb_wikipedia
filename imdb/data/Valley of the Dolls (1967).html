<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anne Welles, a bright, brash young New England college grad leaves her Peyton Place-ish small town and heads for Broadway, where she hopes to find an exciting job and sophisticated men. During her misadventures in Manhattan and, later, Hollywood, she shares experiences with two other young hopefuls: Jennifer North, a statuesque, Monroe-ish actress who wants to be accepted as a human being, but is regarded as a sex object by all the men she meets, and Neely O'Hara, a talented young actress who's accused of using devious means by a great older star (Helen Lawson) to reach the top, pulling an "All About Eve"-type deception in order to steal a good role away from her.</p>
<p>Film version of Jacqueline Susann's best-selling novel chronicling the rise and fall of three young women in show business.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film has everything: (1) A pure, virginal heroine (Barbara Parkins). (2) A basically nice kid corrupted by "Show Business" (Patty Duke). (3) A talentless but good-hearted beauty who meets a sad end (Sharon Tate). (4) An aging musical comedy star desperate to protect her position (Susan Hayward). (5) An assortment of weak, false and unfaithful men (Martin Milner, Tony Scotti and Paul Burke). (6) A seemingly controlling sister-in-law who is hiding a TERRIBLE SECRET (Lee Grant). (7) Several musical numbers with beautiful arrangements (Andre Previn and John Williams) but atrocious lyrics (Dory Previn). (8) Said performers cavorting in front of glamorous sets and handsome scenery. (9) A "Moralistic Happy" ending. (10) Uninterrupted Stupidity.</p>
