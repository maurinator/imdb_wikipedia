<h1>X: The Unheard Music (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film is a documentary about the personalities in, and the music of, the early 1980's Los Angeles punk band X. There are studio and live performances by the band and interviews with band members; all nicely interspersed with footage of area DJs, record stores, old TV shows and commercials.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I own this video and have seen it a few times...I love X...they're one of the best live bands I've ever seen.  That said, this is a video about a band that should have become extremely famous and wealthy, but didn't.  They came at a bad time when punk was big, but not big in a way that anyone really made any money from it (before Green Day).  But there aren't many documentaries about "unheard" bands, and not many about people as talented as the members of X.</p>
