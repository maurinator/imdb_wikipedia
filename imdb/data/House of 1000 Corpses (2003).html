<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film looks as though it were edited by Timothy Leary while on one of his hallucinatory trips.  The story is a poor carbon copy of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and about 150 other teenagers-meet-slasher-family flicks. Which isn't too bad if you're a fan of the genre.  Unfortunately, in this film the makers decided to use sepia toned intercuts amidst the "main" action sequences.  And the flashing back and forth is so fast paced, and so totally random, that half the time the viewer can't tell who is doing what to whom, and for all of the advertised gore, we really don't get to see anything all that explicit.The acting is pretty deficient as well, although newcomer Sheri Moon shows some promise in at least being a captivating screen presence.This movie was a total waste of time, and the cost of the movie tickets, and hopefully shows us the bottom of the barrel in slasher horror.  At least we can rest assured that there is no way for the genre to go from here but up.</p>
