<h1>Without a Clue (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is a Sherlock Holmes story with a difference. Here Dr Watson is the ace detective and has been using an actor to play the part Holmes. Holmes is a drunken actor and gets on Watson's nerves. When Watson tries to go it alone, he doesn't have much success, so he is forced to let Holmes take all the credit once more.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes is as dashing as ever, but with a little secret: Dr. Watson is the brains behing the operation. Watson scripts all of Holmes' solutions, having discovered that while people would believe in Holmes, no one was ready to accept, Dr. Watson, Crime Doctor. When Reginald Kincaid, the actor he has hired to play Holmes becomes insufferable, Watson fires him and tries to go out on his own, but finds that he has done all too good a job building Holmes up in the public's mind.</p>
<p>A drunken Sherlock Holmes is really just a cover for the real detective - Dr Watson.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of Michael Caine's funniest performances and he and Ben Kingsley worked quite well together.  The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Jeffry Jones as LeStrade is very good and Peter Cook has a fine supporting turn.  As for the premise-that Holmes was a front for Watson, given the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was himself a physician and that he grew so sick of Holmes he tried to kill him off, I suspect he would have enjoyed the whole thing enormously.  Twists and turns throughout, as a good mystery should and enough comedy to keep you laughing.  Some interesting twists at the end.  Poor LeStrade!  Recommended.</p>
