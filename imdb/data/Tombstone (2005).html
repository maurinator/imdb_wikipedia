<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this episode of Law And Order, Dennis Farina and Jesse Martin catch a case involving a young female attorney who is found in her office with her skull bashed in with an award she received. Apparently it's the custom in this particular firm to give plaques to those attorneys who work on some really tough, but successful cases. The plaques are euphemistically called 'Tombstones' hence the title.The deceased was beautiful and sexy young attorney who liked to enjoy life. Forensics reveal she was both 10 weeks pregnant and had sex that evening and the fetus and the sperm from her last tryst show no match. Already any competent defense will be putting her sex life on trial.Farina and Martin settle on young Paul Fitzgerald who may have gotten into this firm on an affirmative action deal so to speak and not on race. Everyone else there seems to have graduated from Ivy League law schools, Fitzgerald came from Hofstra. But he's brilliant and the fair haired boy of the senior partner Fritz Weaver, who alibis him up and down for reasons of his own that have nothing to with this case, but some problems Weaver is having.One of the witnesses and a former cop who was involved with the deceased is Robert Clohessy. When he's reluctant to testify, Martin is sent to bring him in. Clohessy is killed and Martin wounded in a driveby shooting. That case gets solved on Law And Order, Trial By Jury. This was done so that Martin could be in the film version of Rent which he appeared in on Broadway.Fritz Weaver shines in this episode as the senior partner in a white shoe law firm who's in one big jackpot anyway he turns.</p>
