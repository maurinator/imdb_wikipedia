<h1>Arizona Dream (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Innuit hunter races his sled home with a fresh-caught halibut. This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there, but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding. It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet turtles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember when I first realized that you really learn what people are like when they're drunk. There are the happy lushes who love the world & fill it with hugs & sloppy kisses when they've had too much. Then there are the ones who get mean, real mean - violent even, all the rage coming out. Some movies bring out the same thing in people. This is one of them. Personally, I think it's a superb movie, but then I was always a lovesick sloppy drunk, too.What more can I say? Everyone in this movie, especially Jerry Lewis is a thousand times better than they have ever been in any other movie. And Kusturica? Not only today's greatest living director, but one of the most creative & original visionaries ever to work in the medium. Breathtaking!</p>
