<h1>The Leopard (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the 1860s, a dying aristocracy struggles to maintain itself against a harsh Sicilian landscape. The film traces with a slow and deliberate rhythm the waning of the noble home of Fabrizio Corbero, Prince of Salina (the Leopard) and the corresponding rise to eminence of the enormously wealthy ex-peasant Don Calogero Sedara. The prince himself refuses to take active steps to halt the decline of his personal fortunes or to help build a new Sicily but his nephew Tancredi, Prince of Falconeri swims with the tide and assures his own position by marrying Don Calogero's beautiful daughter Angelica. The climatic scene is the sumptuous forty-minute ball, where Tancredi introduces Angelica to society.</p>
<p>1860 Sicily. Don Fabrizio Corbera, the Prince of Salina, and his family have long lived a life of privilege, largely isolated by the palace walls from the poverty and squalor experienced by the masses due to government corruption that pervades the island. It is however because of that corruption and squalor that he believes that Sicily would be better served being annexed by Italy, and the reason he supports his dashing and ambitious nephew, Tancredi Falconeri, joining Garibaldi's redshirts, who are currently battling the royalist army on the island. Despite loving his family, Don Fabrizio seemingly loves Sicily more as he does whatever he needs to ensure Sicily's strong future. As such, despite learning that his meek daughter Concetta is in love with Tancredi, who would marry her if given the opportunity, Don Fabrizio believes Tancredi needs a stronger wife to support his role in leading Sicily into a bright future with Italy. Who Tancredi eventually chooses is Angelica Sedara, the daughter of nouveau riche, ambitious and unrefined Don Calogero Sedara, and whose beauty is unrivaled against any other young woman she is around. Regardless of the thoughts of others on the matter, Don Fabrizio knows where he fits within the new Sicily.</p>
<p>The Prince of Salina, a noble aristocrat of impeccable integrity, tries to preserve his family and class amid the tumultuous social upheavals of 1860's Sicily.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Could it be that Visconti's 1963 epic--long lying in ruins until its 1983 partial restoration--is the greatest movie ever made? The real subject of this movie, surely the wisest and most beautiful of all "period pictures," is the twentieth century--what has been gained and above all what is lost. Only a Marxist duke like Visconti could have had the split sensibility, and the anecdotal knowhow, to render Sicily just before its entry to modernity with the splendor and the caginess that radiates through every frame of this masterpiece. As the prince making final compromises before leaving the faded world he has inherited, Burt Lancaster gives one of the greatest performances in movies. Possessed of both an elegiac melancholy and a shrewd, dry-eyed appraisal of the failures and the glorious extroversion of its aristocratic world, THE LEOPARD is like a dream you can't bear to let go of. Contemporary viewers will see echoes of THE DEER HUNTER, 1900 and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE--and will see those films shrivel to the size of cocktail franks.</p>
