<h1>City Hunter: Bay City Wars (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rival private eyes Ryo Saeba and Umibozu must find a way into a high-tech luxury hotel to rescue their friends who are being held hostage and stop a mad South American dictator's plans to use the hotel's supercomputer to unleash a nuclear holocaust. Highly reminiscent of Die Hard, right down to a scene where Ryu bunjee-jumps off of the roof of the hotel skyscraper with a fire hose.</p>
<p>Once again, the City Hunter team finds themselves in hot water as they get caught up in a hostile takeover involving a Central American dictator named General Gillium who has just been overthrown from his country and has been in hiding. But Gillium refuses to accept this and with a band of soldiers carrying high-tech weaponry, he takes over the Bay City Hotel during it's grand opening and to make matters worse, Kaori and Miki are present. Meanwhile, a starving Ryo is wandering the streets of Shinjuku trying to find a bite to eat when he suddenly runs into a lovely young woman named Luna, who for reasons unknown, is being staked out by Falcon, Ryo's rival. When Luna escapes his clutches and accompanies her father to the hotel, the plot begins to fit together. It seems that Luna is an expert hacker with advanced intelligence in computers and she plans to use the hotel's central computer system to launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. in retaliation for her father's coup de tat. Now, it's up to Ryo and Falcon to free the hostages from the hotel and prevent a nuclear holocaust from wiping out the U.S. Will they succeed in freeing Kaori, Miki and the others in time? Will they be able to keep the U.S. from disappearing off the map? But most of all, can Ryo ignore his sensation for 'nookie' long enough to realize that Luna is the enemy?</p>
<p>In the reception for Tokyo Metropolitan Hotel's opening, all the guests are taken hostage by forces working for Central American dictator General Geliya, just deposed by the Pentagon. Two of them are Kaori (Ryo's partner) and Miki (Umibozu's wife). Ryo (the City Hunter) and Umibozu (the ex-mercenary) must rescue them. But meanwhile Kaori and Miki are not the girls who wait for their knights to rescue them!! Fights, bombs, hi-tech weapons, bazookas, big explosions, buildings destroyed...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cause the guys seems more interested in scoring with them ladies than fighting terrorists.  But that doesn't take away the fun of the flick.  The interaction between Falcon and City Hunter is hilarious, the action is constantly high octane and the fun is fast and hard.  Oh, yeah and there are a lot of explosions.  Enjoy!</p>
