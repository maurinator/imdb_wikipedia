<h1>The Bridge (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After a brief separation, David, a photographer, and Marina, a Greek flutist, meet again accidentally. Marina knows what she wants, but David's desire to get back together with this warm and affectionate woman is impeded by his deeper fear of any emotional commitment. Looking at reality from behind his camera, he allows himself to be fascinated by what is alien and distant, but is terrified by what is familiar and close. The moment his lens catches a homeless beggar girl stealing, David - intrigued and curious - starts pursuing her. Eventually, and unaware of his presence, the vagabond girl leads him into her reality, the Bridge. But when he comes here, the reality he witnesses is much harsher and bares no relevance to the aesthetically interesting image his lens has captured, the image his imagination has created.</p>
