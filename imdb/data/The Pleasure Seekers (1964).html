<h1>The Pleasure Seekers (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three American lovelies room together in Madrid and all manage to get themselves into seemingly unhappy relationships with fellows.</p>
<p>Twenty-something American Susie Higgins is visiting her old college roommate, Maggie Williams, a secretary at Continental News Service, and Maggie's current roommate, entertainer Fran Hobson, who are living in Madrid. Susie admits that one of her main goals on this visit is to meet a man. She gets her wish when she catches the eye of wealthy Emilio Lacayo. Because of Maggie's warnings about Emilio being a womanizer - Susie suspects Emilio is what Maggie refers to as her "last year's problem" - Susie tests Maggie's assertion to see if Emilio really does love her or is only trying to get her into bed. Regardless, will Susie be able to resist his charms? Maggie is having her own current man troubles. She's in love with her married middle aged boss, Paul Barton, who also seems attracted to her. One of the news service's reporters, Pete McCoy, who Maggie sees as an irresponsible cad, knows that Paul is also in love with Maggie. But will either be able to do anything about it? Or is Maggie really in love with someone else without yet realizing it? And Fran meets and is immediately attracted to Dr. Andres Briones when he helps her when she's in medical distress. Andres seems to be avoiding her, but it's not quite for the reason she initially believes. Will Susie, Maggie or Fran find true happiness in Madrid?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this one, too. Beautiful locations and great stars! I was a kid when this came out, but it was neat to see a movie about young women who weren't all in a "Bachelor in Paradise" situation. You know, just old men with young girls! (Although, I guess Maggie had to figure her way out of a similar situation! Didn't we all?)Oh well, Madrid was beautiful! I loved Ann-Magret singing "The Pleasure Seekers" and the end song when she sings "your standing there and your grinning, like you don't know you not winning and all the time we're beginning the next time" (It just came to me- its called "The Next Time!)I did wish that Pamela Tiffin's character's wasn't so dumb- but then, all of her characters in films were dumb.</p>
