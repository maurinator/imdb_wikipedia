<h1>The Mechanic (2013)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The transition from childhood to adolescence is challenging, yet an inevitable one. This change is endowed with excitement, emotions, and most significantly with establishing an identity in a world full of epiphanies. While many have an easier time progressing through this phase, others who lack various support systems develop a more ambiguous outlook towards the world. This is one such story about a teenage girl and her struggle to understand, shape, and establish her identity- body, mind, and external relationships- amidst realizations that threaten her innocence. When her innocence is threatened by an older man who follows her around on his bicycle and makes pervert advances on her, her secured world is shattered and her perceptions of world being a small safe haven is no more so. The already tough transition into adulthood is plagued by fears generated by the man. The story fast forwards a few years to show that the girl is married to an affluent powerful man who dotes on her. One day, a mechanic comes to their house to fix the broken refrigerator. As the girl answers the door bell, she realizes that it is the same man who used to follow her and he is the one responsible for her ingrained fears. While rationalizing her thoughts, she realizes that she is no more this scared little young girl, but rather an affluent established woman married to a distinguished person in town. She can no more be a victim of fear. The older man too recognizes his meager place and has remorse for his actions. Thus, this story is not just about one-way forgiveness, but it also takes into consideration the relationship that the perpetrator shares with the victim and his need for atonement.</p>
<p>The film is about the journey of an adolescent girl and how different experiences in her life transform her into the woman she is today.</p>
