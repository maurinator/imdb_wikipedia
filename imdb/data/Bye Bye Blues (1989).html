<h1>Bye Bye Blues (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Story about a WWII wife & mother who joins a local dance band to provide for family while husband at war. Romantic involvement with one of the band members make her decisions difficult when husband returns from war. Story watches the progression of the band as it grows into a popular, successful recording and touring group. Excellent music and soundtrack.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This heart-warming & poignant story is beautifully filmed & well directed. Excellent acting and well written screenplay. This low-budget creative endeavor deserved much more press & critical acclaim. I hope it gets a re-release as previous comment suggested is made available on a DVD.A must-see for people who appreciate good films. Also, wonderful music. A gem!</p>
