<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Adam and Barbara are a normal couple...who happen to be dead. They have given their precious time to decorate their house and make it their own, but unfortunately a family is moving in, and not quietly. Adam and Barbara try to scare them out, but end up becoming the main attraction to the money making family. They call upon Beetlejuice to help, but Beetlejuice has more in mind than just helping.</p>
<p>After Barbara and Adam Maitland die in a car accident, they find themselves stuck haunting their country residence, unable to leave the house. When the unbearable Deetzes and teen daughter Lydia buy the home, the Maitlands attempt to scare them away without success. Their efforts attract Beetlejuice, a rambunctious spirit whose "help" quickly becomes dangerous for the Maitlands and innocent Lydia.</p>
<p>After Barbara and Adam Maitland were killed in a car crash, they find themselves trapped as ghosts in their beautiful New England farmhouse. Their peace is disrupted when a yuppie family, the Deetzs, buy their house. The Maitlands are too nice and harmless as ghosts and all their efforts to scare the Deetzs away were unsuccessful. They eventually turn to another ghost 'Beetlejuice' for help.</p>
<p>This is the story of Adam and Barbara who live in a beautiful house in New England. One day while driving home they are involved in a terrible auto accident. They manage to walk home only to discover later that they have died and now haunt their house. When their house is purchased by an out of state family, they feel their home is threatened by the over-the-top artist wife and real-estate idea-man husband. Their only relief is the Gothic daughter of the family. Their attempts at scaring the family out of the house are ignored or laughed at. Finally they fall to the temptation to use the people-exorciser Beetlejuice. When they find his tactics too dangerous, they attempt to contain him and save the family they were trying to boot.</p>
<p>The Deetz's gothic daughter discovers the Maitands in the attic and befriends them. She finds their after-life handbook which is eventually confiscated by the family's interior decorator who is fascinated by the paranormal, and during a seance, conjures up the Maitlands. Most of the trouble starts as the free-lance bio-exorcist Beetlejuice gets involved.</p>
<p>A couple of recently deceased ghosts contract the services of a "bio-exorcist" in order to remove the obnoxious new owners of their house.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A+One of my favorite Tim Burton films ever, one of the movies I've loved since a time I can't remember. Where else could I possibly start other than with Michael Keaton. H embodies a distasteful, rude, and ultimately awesome character known as Betelegeuse. It's a role I highly doubt any other actor could play as well as Keaton did. He is an odd cross between anti-hero and villain, while still very far from just the general comic relief. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are pretty good as the newly-dead couple, and Winona Ryder is always a treat. The rest of the cast is also awesome in their roles, not a weak spot in sight.The cast is only the beginning of why this movie is so great. The production design is dark yet beautiful, each set so haunting. The makeup and good old stop motion are used with great effect, both adding to the horror-like atmosphere. During it all Burton breathes nicely done comedy into it all. Heightening all this is Danny Elfman's awesome score. And the black humor is superb, making it one of the most unusual yet original films out there.I guarantee with this movie you will never get a funnier portrayal of what the afterlife must be like. Each time you watch, you only notice more and more little details. "Beetlejuice" is recognized as a genre-breaking one-of-a-kind film, and rightfully so.</p>
