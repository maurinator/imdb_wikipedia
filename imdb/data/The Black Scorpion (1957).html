<h1>The Black Scorpion (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Giant scorpions demolish Mexico City. They have been released from underground caverns by a series of volcanic eruptions, and it's up to Hank, an American geologist to stop them.</p>
<p>Volcanic activity frees giant scorpions from the earth who wreak havoc in the rural countryside and eventually threaten Mexico City.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Giant scorpions are unearthed by an earthquake and threaten to attack New Mexico.  By the numbers script, but the acting is (surprisingly) good...it's just that the script is VERY dull.  And when the giant scorpions (and worms and spiders) are on screen the movie is fantastic.  These creatures look terrifying (the close ups of the scorpions' face are not pleasant) and the stop motion animation is superb.  So...dull except when the monsters are on screen.  Worth seeing for monster fans.</p>
