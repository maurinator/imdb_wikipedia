When she picks up her younger brother at a Brooklyn gym where he boxes to please his father, she decides she wants to train. Hector, a coach, reluctantly agrees to teach her. It's soon clear to him that Diana has talent; he pushes her.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have become a huge fan of Michelle Rodriguez ever since machete,i think she is an awesome screen presence,beauty and brawn,a tough streetwise pretty woman.girlfight is a very well made independent movie about a tough young girl who wants to become a boxer.its like cross between rocky and the karate kid.she trains hard to become a boxer in the mainly male dominated sport,shes at odds with her father and her classmates.not to give any spoilers away but the movie and the acting especially by Michelle Rodriguez are excellent.after this film Michelle went on to star in two fast and furious films,avatar,blue crush,s.w.a.t. and the best out of all of them;machete.i think that Michelle Rodriguez is by far the best action star and actress of the new millennium.i enjoyed girlfight more than million dollar baby with Hillary Swank.all i can say is Michelle Rodriguez is an one of a kind actress who is a combination of beauty,brains,and brawn.with attitude.</p>
