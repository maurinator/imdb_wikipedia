<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bingo is a great kids' movie, especially for kids that love dogs. I loved it so much as a child that I named one of my dogs Bingo.Bingo is an adorable mutt who lives with a circus. After his fear of fire messes up a circus act he is thrown out of the circus and runs off to the woods. While there he finds a lonely boy named Chuckie, who fell off his bike and passed out. Chuckie sneaks his new friend home and they have all sorts of fun, skateboarding, playing video games, and even doing homework. But Chuckie can't keep Bingo a secret from his family for long, and Bingo is left behind when Chuckie's family moves across the country. Bingo then makes it his mission to follow and find Chuckie. Along the way he encounters good guys, bad guys andÂ…weird guys as he tries to find his best friend and save the day! Bingo is corny. It's nothing new. But it's cute, it's charming, and it's entertaining for kids. Along with that, it's not so childish that parents will want to destroy the DVD. I even find myself enjoying it as an adult. It's definitely better than most children's movies made now (like the "Buddies" series), so give it a look.</p>
