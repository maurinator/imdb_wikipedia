<h1>Cruel Intentions 2 (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A few years before the events depicted in the 1999 film. It follows the lives of rich step siblings Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil as they playfully manipulate the people surrounding them at their exclusive New York prep school.</p>
<p>This takes place several years before Cruel Intentions (1999), back to when Kathryn first meets Sebastian, their sexual attraction to each other and their enjoyment in destroying the lives of their peers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>They had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat. In the first Cruel Intentions, we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do. There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me. It was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything. The writing was just terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as "down boy", or the kissing scene, and a few others I can't remember. I was not impressed at all by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job. That's about the only thing that reconciled this movie.</p>
