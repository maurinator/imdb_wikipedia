<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Rose is about a woman whose sole purpose in life was to give of herself completely.  Protected from adult responsibilities by her manager, "Rose" dug further and further inside herself, alienating all those who loved her. With an adolescent attitude toward life, she indulged in every excess. The poignant scene in the phone booth, where she overdoses on a lethal combination of pain killers, heroin, and booze is certainly worthy of an Academy Award.  We feel her pain, and we really believe we are seeing a woman in the last hour of her life.  Killing herself before our eyes, yet we are helpless to stop her. We can't stop watching.  The final scene, and the final song Rose sings, Stay With Me, is filmmaking at its best. It sums up her life, and the life of so many talented musicians (Kurt Cobane, Jim Morrison, etc).  Rose was desperate to have someone, anyone, who was there just for her.  Yet she pushed everyone away who truly cared about her.  Bette Midler's passionate and inspired performances in concert footage is unforgettable.  The Rose is one of the best movies ever made.</p>
