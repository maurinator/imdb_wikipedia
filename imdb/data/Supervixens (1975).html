<h1>Supervixens (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Clint Ramsey has to leave his job working at Martin Bormann's gas station and flee after his wife is murdered by psycho cop Harry Sledge, who tries to pin the murder on Clint. Crossing America, Clint gets sexually harassed on all sides by various voluptuous nymphomaniacs, and it all ends in a literally explosive climax.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie follows the hilarious odyssey of a nice young fellow, on the run for one man and an army of very very voluptuous bigbreasted women. The production and the visualization is low budget, but very effective and moody, the humor is really incredibly weird (especially the Nazi-jokes are very sick) and the violence is convincingly sadistic. One of the most exciting films ever made and absolutely Meyer's masterpiece. Nice, nice, nice!</p>
