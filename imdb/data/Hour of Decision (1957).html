<h1>Hour of Decision (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An American journalist solves the mystery of an unpleasant columnist's murder and clears his own wife, one of the many suspects.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is standard fare for the 1950's British crime/ drama/ mystery B movies that were endlessly churned out in that period. An American newspaper reporter (Jeff Morrow), now domiciled in England is married to the delicious Hazel Court.Our Hazel has something in her past, and a blackmailing cad has letters she has written that she would rather the husband not be aware of. Things become quite messy when the blackmailer is murdered not long after being seen with a mystery woman (Hazel). Hazel tells all to her husband, the detective investigating the murder enlists the help of the husband who attempts to shield Hazel from being identified, as the detective is convinced the mystery woman is responsible for the death of the blackmailer.The movie climaxes with an Agatha Christie style of assembling everyone involved in the drama while the detective and husband Jeff play out a charade which reveals the true murderer. This then leaves Jeff and Hazel to live happily ever after, and Scotland Yard to be eternally grateful for newspaper reporters who solve crimes for them.The movie shifts along at a great pace and the acting is very good. Watch for a couple of wonderful character actors of the period, Lionel Jeffries and a cameo appearance by Arthur Lowe (Dad's Army). Four stars from five.</p>
