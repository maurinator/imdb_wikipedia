<h1>Heathcliff: The Movie (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a rainy day as Uncle Heathcliff is forced to babysit his nephews, and spends the time recounting his adventures, he meets a cat who looks just like him, one where he winds up working for a mob boss, one where his dad gets released from prison but he thinks he escaped, one where he actually tries to be good, and a few others. In one tale, Heathcliff's pop gets parole, although Heathcliff thinks he's escaped; in another, Heathcliff's "good angel" conscience makes a short-lived appeal to his saintly side. Nostalgia reigns as the tabby holy terror plays various roles of television star, wrestling champ, and neighborhood bully.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Heathcliff the movie was released at the movies in 1986 by clubhouse pictures.The film is just a clip show. Think of the bugs bunny clip movies and you'll get the idea.The film has a wrap-around story of heathcliff telling stories to his nephews. The nephews try to escape the boring stories and fail each time.The stories are from the cartoon series, heathcliff and catallac cats.The catallac cats only show up in the opening and end credits and never talk.Mel blank does the voice for heathcliff! The film is on DVD, but is missing the clubhouse pictures intro the original release had.The film aired on the Disney channel in the 80's.</p>
