<h1>Gunman's Walk (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Widower Lee Hackett (Van Heflin), a cattle rancher who is a product of the old west, tries to bring up his two sons, Ed (Tab Hunter)and Davy (James Darren), in his image, but Ed is wild and unruly. The two brothers are both attracted to Clee Chourard ('Kathryn Grant(I)') but she prefers Davy. Ed's efforts to outshine his father and brother and everyone else leads him into a career of a gunfighter, and a confrontation with his father.</p>
<p>Rancher Lee Hackett is one of the old breed, used to making his own laws and settling things with a gun. He has tried to make his two sons in his own image, and with the elder he has more than succeeded, to the extent that he is accused of murdering a half-breed. But his younger son is different, eschewing the old rules and even becoming drawn to the sister of the murdered man. Lee starts to find that his way of doing things is no longer working.</p>
<p>A powerful rancher always protects his wild adult son by paying for damages and bribing witnesses, until his crimes become too serious to rectify.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An outstanding and unjustly neglected western from that fine genre director Phil Karlson who, if he never quite made it to the front ranks, could nevertheless be counted upon to produce first rate and thought-provoking entertainments of which this is one. Karlson had no problem juggling the pieces' myriad themes, (the Freudian relationship between a martinet father and his hot-headed son, miscegenation and racial prejudice, gun culture and the changing ways of the West), without ever sacrificing the solid entertainment value of what is essentially a good old-fashioned western.As the father piling all his affection on the wrong son, Van Heflin is as reliable as ever. The real surprise of the picture, however, is Tab Hunter as the son who both hates and idolizes his father. Hunter was never much of an actor but here, cast against type as the villain of the piece, he manages to bring depth and feeling to the role. Perhaps he located the misfit nature of the character. After all, being gay in Hollywood in the fifties and living a life that was fundamentally a lie, surely can't have been easy.</p>
