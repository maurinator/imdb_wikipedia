<h1>Casanova's Big Night (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Italy, 1757. Lowly tailor Pippo Popolino disguises himself as the great Casanova in order to romance attractive widow Francesca. He little suspects what he's getting into: locked into the incongruous role by the desperation of the real Casanova's creditors, Pippo must journey to Venice on a delicate mission far beyond his capabilities.</p>
<p>A meek tailor thinks his wooing will be helped if he assumes the identity of the famous Casanova...who's deeply in debt.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow, what a cast! This Bob Hope film sure sported a long list of wonderful supporting actors, such as Joan Fontaine, Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone, Raymond Burr, John Carradine, John Hoyt, Lon Chaney, Jr.and even the ex-boxing champ, Primo Carnera! It's really amazing to see so many familiar faces in a rather ordinary sort of film.Hope plays a tailor's apprentice who is roped into impersonating the famous lover, Casanova. It seems the real Casanova is a deadbeat and his many creditors have devised a plan to use Hope in his place. All Hope needs to do is try to seduce a young lady (Hope Emerson) to see if she is or is not virtuous--as her prospective mother-in-law wants to test her. He is assisted by Rathbone and Fontaine (who is WAAAY to old for this role). Naturally, things don't go as they all planned and soon Hope is running for his life.As for the film, it's pretty much a typical 1940s-50s Bob Hope film--very pleasant and fun, but not particularly outstanding--even with the excellent supporting cast. High points would include a cute prison cell scene and a cute ending. And, among the lamest moments was Hope in drag. While cross-dressing is usually a sure laugh-getter, Hope's routine is pretty poor and this good idea falters.</p>
