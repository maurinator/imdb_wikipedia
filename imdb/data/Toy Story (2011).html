<h1>Toy Story (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>With Cinema Connection.com's award columnist out of town at the worst possible time, our cheerless hero inherits coverage of Hollywood's most prestigious (and pompous) ceremony. When new chief editor Sue demands he review Best Pic nominee Toy Story 3, Ducks draws a line in the sand, refusing to support the barefaced commercialization embedded in a cartoon about toys...but its not easy for cranky film crusader to stay firm in his morals when his inner child manifests himself in the garb of a certain plastic cowboy, or when his boss is as stubborn as she is easy on the eyes. Come join the fun as Greg Ducks reminds us all about everything we love about Oscar season: vapid materialism, shameless self-promotion, and the ritualistic deification of people who are more beautiful than we are.</p>
