<h1>Operation Bikini (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>With posters featuring a stylized-drawing of Eva Six in a bikini, a tagline reading..."Temptation in Paradise...neither hell nor high heels could stop them", and a Dream Sequence Technical Adviser credit for Bob Marcucci, American-International once again proved it had no peers when it came to sleight-of-hand advertising selling a war-movie when war movies weren't selling. This one starts in the Pacific in 1943 when an American submarine staffed by the likes of Scott Brady, Jim Backus and Michael Dante (the old guns to get the old folks in) has a rendezvous with a cruiser to pick up an underwater demolition team comprised of the likes of Tab Hunter, Frankie Avalon, Gary Crosby and Jody McCrea (the young turks to get the kids in, which probably only worked in Southern California), and there is conflict right off as the sub crew feels like they are being denied a chance to revenge the sinking of a sister sub because they have to deliver Tab and Frankie to an island on a super-secret special mission guaranteed to affect the entire course of the war in the Pacific. These guys are landed on the Japanese-infested island and find their guerilla support consists of an old man, a teen-ager and three girls.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>1st watched 6/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Anthony Carras): Unfocused war movie that tries to throw in video clips from Frankie Avalon and dancing girls in bikini's at the end to lighten it up?  If it would have been a war adventure from beginning to end it would have been better.  This film is basically about a special mission being sent to Bikini Island in the south Pacific to rescue a sunken U.S. submarine(for what reason I wasn't sure).  A miniature romance begins  with Tab Hunter and an island girl, but she gets killed in the next scene, and supposedly Frankie is enticed in his dreams by a seductive island girl and is tempted by her in his song  while his girl is at home waiting for him(of course this is just a setup for his singing - he never encounters the temptation).  Silly little things like this, and Jim Backus trying to throw in lame humor when his character really doesn't seem like he should have any, is also silly.  This movie reminds me of something the studio chopped up and sold for what it wasn't about, to try and make some money(which I hope it didn't). Bottom line this is a lame attempt at a war movie with a couple of lame songs song by Mr. Avalon.</p>
