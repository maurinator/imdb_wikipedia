<h1>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Originally filmed in December 1968, "The Rock and Roll Circus" was originally intended to be released as a television special. The special was filmed over two nights and featured not only the Rolling Stones but The Who, Jethro Tull (with future Black Sabbath guitarist Tommy Iommi filling in for the recently departed Mick Abrahams), Marianne Faithful and an all-star jam featuring John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Micthell. Sadly, this also marked the final appearance of the Stones founder and original guiding light, Brian Jones, who would be dead within six months after filming the special.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At the time of this film (Dec, 68) Jethro Tull was a virtually unknown group. The circus show opens appropriately with the odd-ball band doing 'Song For Jeffrey'. Great to see Tull when they were nobody but on their way up. Too bad we only got one song. 'The Who' was next. If you are a Who fan then this is vintage. Keith Moon is on fire. Taj Mahal brings the blues out like few can next. What a presence that man has/had. His singing is so very strong you can feel it come deep from his soul. It vibrates. Next a very thin looking John Lennon and Eric Clapton collaborate to do some bluesy numbers with Keith Richards on bass and Mitch Mitchell (of Hendrix Experience fame) on drums. Other than the material being clich√©, weak blues songs, the playing is world class. Then we are subjected to Yoko squeaking, which you can FF through. Do not waste your time there is nothing redeeming about her 'performance'. After this Marian Faithful does a number. We get a great view into her vocal strength and blue-eyed-soul. It is kind of spooky to realize how many of these people were doing heroin at the time of this film. Next of course are the Stones. We get to see Brian Jones before he passed away. Mick unveils his devil tattoos at the end of the film during 'Sympathy For The Devil'. I wonder if he really did those permanently.Not a bad film - great music - except Yoko. She is a dear person but has no place on a singing stage. I would have preferred maybe 2 or 3 more Tull songs over 12 minutes of her screeching.</p>
