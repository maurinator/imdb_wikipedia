<h1>Die Berührte (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Doctors say that Veronika, a woman in her 20s, is schizophrenic. She is compliant, which makes her an easy target for men. She's religious, believing she is God's favorite child; she searches for Jesus. She has sent a letter to a filmmaker suggesting her life as the subject for a movie. We see her raped than take up with a series of men she believes are Jesus, each willing or insistent on sex. A young man with his own crisis of faith invites her to join a cult. We see her involuntarily committed to an asylum from time to time where medication and constraints await. Her wealthy parents are helpless. Will a medical professional ever talk to her? If one did, would it help?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"No Mercy No Future" is based on the letters of schizophrenic woman Rita G.The main character Veronika Christoph is suffering from this type of mental illness.She wanders the streets of gray and bleak Berlin looking for Jesus Christ and has sex with desperately lonely and poor men.Veronika joins a religious commune,but she only finds hypocrisy there.Her various suicide and self-cutting attempts are shown quite graphically.When she delves into depression Veronika wants to die.The director said that she wanted to film madness from within,the madness of a female schizophrenic,the madness of the ice-cold society which she wants to warm with her small body.Overall,the film is bleak and depressing with its scenes of menstrual sex and hen butchery.7 out of 10.</p>
