<h1>Psycho (1992)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Standard setup, moments of twisted humor as two college kids travel cross country and take the scenic route and run into Billy Badd (aka Motorpsycho), a messed up little mussolini biker freak that models himself after the road warrior and speaks in pop-culture speak.  Good biker chase for a superlowbudget film.</p>
