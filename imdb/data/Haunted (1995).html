<h1>Haunted (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Professor David Ash is invited to Edbrook to calm the fears of the elderly nanny of the Mariell family. Nanny Tess is seeing things, and Ash's book debunking such phenomenon makes him a good choice to set her mind at ease and convince her she is just tired and stressed. But soon after arriving David too begins to doubt his senses, and watching the odd behavior of the three grown Mariell children doesn't make his task any easier. In fact, he begins to think Nanny Tess isn't really just tired and stressed out after all.</p>
<p>In 1905, in Sussex, England, the young boy David loses his twin sister while playing with her nearby a lake. The girl falls and drowns in the lake, and David feels guilty for her death. The grieving family returns to USA, and twenty-three years later, David Ash comes back to England, to be the professor of psychology in the University of Camberley. The skeptical David is specialized in psychic phenomena and exposition of false mediums and frauds, and wrote a successful book about this subject. After a countless number of calls from an elder lady called Miss Webb claiming to be haunted by ghosts, David is informed that the lady lives in Edbrook, and he decides to accept her invitation to visit her. When he arrives in Edbrook's train station, the beautiful young woman Christina Mariell is waiting for him. She drives him to her remote mansion, where she lives with her two brothers and their former nanny, Miss Webb. After being introduced to the family, David finds the behavior of Miss Webb very weird and disturbed, but decides to investigate the existence of any psychic phenomena in the place. Meanwhile, Christina and him fall in love for each other. Their romance and his investigation come to surprising revelations.</p>
<p>After the accidental death of his twin sister, David and his family move back to the United States. In 1928, David returns to England to teach at Cambridge. Besides teaching, David is an author who exposes false mediums and spiritualist. While he has never found a person who can communicate with the "dearly departed", his continues to accept challenges. For this reason, and the desperate letter he receives from Miss Webb, he heads to Edbrook to investigate her claims of spirits who torment her. At Edbrook Hall, David meets beautiful Christina and her two brothers who live in the house with Nanny Tess.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>About once a year, a film impresses me so much that i have to call or write to all my friends immediately, demanding that they watch it too. Haunted is one of the finest movies i've seen in many years, and it's really a shame that not many people have seen it.The cast is superb, with each character standing out, even those with just a couple lines (the fortune teller who reads David and Christina's palms is a good example). The stars, Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale, are in excellent form, but Anthony Andrews steals the show in this one. He plays the character of Robert, the jealous and controlling big brother. There is a brilliant shot of his pale, depressed face surrounded by mocking darkness that perfectly defines the tortured-soul of the character. Anthony Andrews has such a strong, masculine English voice that makes him wonderful for all sorts of different roles. Just as entertaining is the younger brother, Simon (played by Alex Lowe), who is an obnoxious prankster with a playful soul. The late, great John Gielgud is also memorable in this movie for his portrayal of a kind, but mysterious doctor. Lewis Gilbert's direction is absolutely flawless, and i definately look forward to seeing his other films. Haunted is such an attractive movie: everything looks so heavenly and enticing. In the daytime, Edbrook is such a charming place; a wonderful place to spend your childhood, but when night creeps up, it shows a perfect gothic presence. Haunted is probably the best ghost story i've ever experienced. It's unpredictable, charming, touching, frightening, and constantly entertaining. Perhaps my favorite scene is when David tries to trap a possible ghost outside of the Mariell mansion, and from out of nowhere, a cloud of dust spins in fascination. Soon after, a distorted ghost that sobs uncontrollably is conjured that floats away, beckoning David to follow it to the angry lake. This is one of the many truly magical moments found in this one-of-kind film. The sound effects are just as impressive as the visuals (the sounds of the howling wind and crashing rain are terrific). Also, the score is heartbreakingly lovely.Even if you don't like horror movies, you need to give this one a shot because it has so much to offer. There is no gore, so squeamish-stomach people should have a pleasant time with this one.  Rent or buy Lewis Gilbert's Haunted now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* * * * * (out of 5)"You had your chance to leave, David"</p>
