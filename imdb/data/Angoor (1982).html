<h1>Angoor (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ashok R. Tilak lives in Dinkapur with his widowed mother, and a servant named Bahadur. He travels to another town on a business trip to buy several acres of grape-bearing trees, with Bahadur accompanying him. Although this is his first trip to this town, however, everyone appears to know him and Bahadur, including the Ticket Checker at the Railway Station, the taxi-driver, the Hotel Manager, local Police Inspector Sinha, a Jeweler named Chhedilal and his assistant Mansoor, and to top it all a woman named Sudha claims that she is his wife, and another woman named Tanu claims that she is his sister-in-law, while a third one named Alka claims that she is his mistress. All's not well for Bahadur either for he bears the brunt of this confusion when he finds out that he has a wife named Prema; a normally sane boss, who keeps on sniffing snuff and smoking alternatively, and who yells and slaps him frequently. After a nightmarish night, the hapless duo decide they have had enough and decide to return home, only to have the police arrest them for theft of a diamond necklace. Watch what happens when the truth is hilariously revealed at the Police Station of this town that has never these comedy of errors - ever.</p>
<p>Based on Shakespeare's 'A comedy of errors', this is a story of identical twins (2 pairs) and mistaken identities.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perfectly casted into a fabulous movie, perfect in comedy and fun. Inspired by William Shakespeare's The Comedy Of Errors, this movie displays a general confusion regarding two characters (each in a double role), having same name. This movie illustrates the beauty of acting and superb performance by every character. This movie is worth watching to everyone. Acting performance is natural and really really funny. This movie is one of the best movie (comedy) that I have ever watched in my life. I rate this movie 9/10, as it is perfect and natural. There are no villains, no fight scenes in the movie, yet it is very effective and influencing. The movie makes us laugh at the very start of the movie, and makes us laugh till the end. This movie is directed by Gulzar, who is, in my view, one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. Songs are not bad, and the song "Pritam aan milo" makes movie superb and Worth to watch.</p>
