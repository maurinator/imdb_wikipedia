<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It seems this movie gets watched either because of Jon Bon Jovi or in spite of him. I'm one of the latter - it was on TV right after my supper and i said ok, now i'll watch this movie even if JBJ is starring... i must say that my prejudice wasn't based on his acting, as i never watched him act - it's more that i find his music trash. But he turned out quite a ok actor. But even better was the movie overall - a smart relationships- and looking-for-love story with a nice plot revolving around 5-and-a-half characters and taking sharp turns every 10 minutes, with (almost) everything happening at wrong times. I did find the style of some of the main characters' various confessions slightly over-styled for the confidant at hand, but i did like the idea of every character having his own way of analysing him/herself aloud (confession booth, support-group, taxi-dispatcher, shrink, diary); but i also didn't mind the glitch in light of the rest of this witty, funny, honest, warm movie. I especially liked the acts of Josh Charles and Annabella Sciorra.</p>
