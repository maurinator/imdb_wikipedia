<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A professional thief is hired by the FBI to steal a data tape from a company under investigation. The analysis of this tape, will prove the criminal activities of this company. As this thief is discovered in his attempt, he hides the tape inside a prototype car, but unfortunately there is someone else interested in this vehicle.</p>
<p>Former burglar Quint is forced by FBI-agent Johnson to steal a tape with incriminating evidence from a suspicious company. Unfortunately he is caught in the act by guard Ringer, a ruthless ex-colleague. Running from the scene, Quint hides the tape in the "Black Moon", a prototype super car made by inventor Earl Windom. Shortly thereafter, this car is stolen by Nina, who works for top car thief Ryland. Chased by Ringer and Johnson, both thinking he still has the tape, Quint's only way out is to steal the car back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nice little film this though some may disagree! Of course, I'm a fan of this kind of low-budget action/sci-fi fare, and the fact that John Carpenter wrote the screenplay is a bonus. While it does come across as a TV movie, or a pilot for a series that never was, it keeps rolling along with enough action to please the most hardened of late-night, post-pub film fan. It's funny how many programmes featured suped up vehicles in the 80's, and while Black Moon should be linked most closely to Knightrider, I think it has a lot more in common with Streethawk. Tommy-Lee Jones is excellent in the lead role and it's nice to see him in a younger incarnation, getting involved in all the gritty events.All in all, a good, hidden gem of a film. Give it a try!</p>
