They must become adults.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nowhere to Run is like two movies smushed into one film. It's the 1960s. You have the plot of the coming-of-age high school seniors lead by hot shot Howard (Jason Priestly) and followed by the timid Jerry Lee (Kieran Mulroney). Just a bunch of kids looking for a good time.On the other hand, you have the murder mystery aspect with Harmon (David Carradine) who pays off the cops and junk to get himself out of jail. And he's come back to that biayou town looking for his money. He's a very creepy, quiet kind of guy.Then the two stories merge when the teengers figure out that the Mayoral candidate helped pay Harmon's way out of jail, and suddenly they become Harmon's new target as he tries to shut them up.The first time I watched this movie, I was slightly satisfied, only having watched it in the first place because Matt Adler was in it. But, watching it again, I was disappointed by how slow the story moves along, which is quite annoying. First, you have to wade through all this "what are you going to do after high school" sentimental falling in love crap that could have made a separate dull drama in itself. And then, you have what could have been an interesting mystery plot, but it gets bogged down in all of the corniness of the horny teenagers in love mess.It is far too slow and too ridiculous to enjoy.</p>
