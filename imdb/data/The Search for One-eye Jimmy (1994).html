<h1>The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While working on a documentary on his old neighborhood, a young film school graduate shifts the focus of his production onto the disappearance of a local resident and the strange characters who are conducting the search to find him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The idea of the movie struck me as strange, so naturally, I rented it. It was worth it, though!  This movie was incredibly funny, and there were so many memorable characters (most notably the notorious "One-Eyed Jimmy" and Samuel L. Jackson's character).  A very ironic, and ingenious movie!</p>
