<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>PLOT Vijay Babu (Sanjeev Kumar) is a sentimental poet with a tragedy in past looses his mental balance. Chand (Mumtaj) - a poor girl - is hired for his recovery, who initially refuses but later falls for Vijay. How she helps Vijay out of his trauma is the story.ACTING AND DIRECTIONDirection is good. Sanjeev Kumar is outstanding. Mumtaj beautifully summarizes her role. In a smaller role Jeetendra is effective. Shatrughn Sinha excels in a negative role.MUSIC The music is excellent and the songs picturised on Sanjeev Kumar are outstanding. "Khush Rahe Tu Sada Yeh Dua hai Meri, Bewafa hi sahi dilruba hai meri...", "Khilona Jaan kar tum to mera dil tode jaate ho.." are excellent. Mohammed Rafi's singing from his heart is evident.A Movie Worth Watching 9/10 from me.</p>
