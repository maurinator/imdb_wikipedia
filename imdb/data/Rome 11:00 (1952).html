<h1>Rome 11:00 (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on an actual incident, this is the story of five girls (told in a slow beginning) who are among the 200 women who answer a want ad for a modest secretarial position one rainy morning in Rome in 1951. They crowd and push their way into the old building and fight their way up the stairs to await an interview, only to be told there is not enough time to interview all. A scuffle breaks out and the stairway collapses sending many of them hurtling down in a mass of bodies amid brick and mortar. Among them are the well-born wife of a poor artist;, a streetwalker making an attempt to change her life; an unhappy servant girl; and the desperate wife of an unemployed factory worker. How the event changes or fails to change their lives is told.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Roma, ore 11" (1952) is another great neo-realist picture, one that has not achieved broad circulation, leaving it quite obscure compared with more famous pictures. There's a region 2 DVD but the subtitles are Italian only. Nevertheless, there is a good print with English subtitles somewhere to be found because I secured one at some point from a web site that now has disappeared.Italian pictures like this usually have some intensely emotional moments that make me cry, which is why I space out my viewing of them. This one is no exception. This picture has everything, meaning a full canvas of human beings behaving like human beings but also within the unique Italian culture. The writing and directing bring out many fleeting instances of emotional reactions and attitudes throughout both the larger and smaller parts. I can't think of another cinema that could have or has produced a film like this.Several hundred young women arrive to be interviewed for a single open typist position. We get to meet and understand a handful of them, along with a few men in their lives as they experience a big accident, which is the collapse of a several-story staircase under their weight and jostling.Here are a few of the main applicants with the actresses who played them. The very first arrival is the shy Eva Vanicek, pushed along by her mother. Then comes the pregnant and unmarried Elena Varzi; her condition is not known by her father. She never smiles until near the end. Lea Padovani has a notable presence as a prostitute looking for something better. Delia Scala is a servant, miserable under her masters, she too looking for another job. Raf Vallone, a struggling artist, has a mistress, Lucia Bos√©, who is injured. Her well-off parents disapprove of Vallone. Massimo Girotti is paired with Carla Del Poggio. Another applicant, Maria Grazia Francia, makes eyes and contact with a sailor.</p>
