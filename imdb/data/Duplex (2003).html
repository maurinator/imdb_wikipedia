<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Danny Devito's Duplex is a winking little slice of dark comedy, in the vein of Throwing Momma From The Train. It's not quite as pointed or unique as other notches in Devito's satirical belt (Death To Smoochy, War Of The Roses) but it has a pleasantly naughty vibe and knows it's silly, which adds to the fun. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore play perky New York yuppies who find their dream home, at an unbelievable price. The only catch: it's a shared residence, and upstairs lives an adorable 90 year old Irish woman (Eileen Essell is a tornado of comedic joy, and whisks the film into awesomeness territory with her unrelenting vigor). She's sweet as pie, or so their dubious real estate agent (Harvey Fierstein, turning the sleaze meter up to 11) informs them, with a foretelling smirk. Only, she's not. She's a bothersome, insufferable nightmare, pestering Alex, whos a writer and works at home, no end with mind numbing chores and delusional household concerns. The law dictates they can't evict her without severe reasons, and they are left tormented by this polite, good natured harpee of untold resilience. Their desperation eventually turns to thoughts of killing her (as any self respecting Devito film must, of course). There the plot fires up with a merry go round of their hapless attempts to 'off' this charming dame, each attempt more ludicrous and chaotic than the last. Some include hiring a scary hit man (James Remar), pushing her down the stairs, trying to give her a nasty pandemic, and many more. Stiller is sometimes annoying, sometimes great when he has the right script, and here he fires on all cylinders as a man at the end of his rope, taking the audacious tone that Devito is going for to orbital heights of hilarity. Devito provides colorful opening narration, and there's knowingly absurd work from Justin Theroux, Wallace Shawn, Reba McIntyre, Robert Wisdom and more. Not a great film, but one I have great nostalgia for. Irreverent, sardonic and gleeful, and unless you have a stick up your ass, sure to make you giggle at Devito's unending silliness.</p>
