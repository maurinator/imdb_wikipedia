<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two ex-cons, Harry (Aiello) and Roy (Pantoliano) execute a robbery they think will net them $250k. When they find the safe empty, Roy, decides to kidnap Gary, the eight year old son of their victims. Gary's hypochondriac mother has told the boy he is allergic to everything, keeping the lad from having a pet, going anywhere or doing anything. The boy is even home schooled and therefore has no friends his own age. When frustrated Roy wants to hurt and later kill the boy, Harry protects and then runs off with the kid leaving Roy tied up. Naturally Roy is angry, and being rather psychotic, he comes after Harry for revenge. Meanwhile, Gary has formed a strong attachment to Harry and the two have a wild adventure and wind up hiding out at a motel owned by a former sixties flower child. She falls for Harry and wants to help him escape the law. Then trouble starts from two directions and Harry must make a difficult choice about the future - both his and young Gary's.</p>
<p>A lonely and emotionally neglected rich kid forms an attachment to one of the men who kidnap him during a botched robbery of his father's safe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was aired recently on WAM and I didn't get in on the very beginning of the film. I thought the film had it's touching, moving aspects, especially the development of the relationship between Danny Aiello and Alex Zuckerman's characters. Perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, it follows what happens sometimes when the kidnapped bonds with the kidnapper. And it helped the plot to have one of the kidnappers be the "baddie" and Aiello's character the "good guy at heart."If there was one aspect of the film which bugged me, it's the same thing that always bugs me. Why is it necessary to get a kick out of seeing and hearing a child use profanity? Yeah, I know it was supposed to illustrate the level of bonding, and yeah, I know they use it in the real world in some homes, but I think most parents get tired of letting their kids watch what is supposed to be a family film, and then have to go through....."I don't care that the kid said 'Son of a *****' in the film, we don't use language like that in this house." It just simply isn't necessary, and I can't help wondering if filmmakers do it on purpose just to get a rise out of people like me. Probably! :) It's also sad that a kid actor with hopes of advancing his/her career probably couldn't refuse to do what he was told too often. I remember Austin O'Brien and Henry Thomas in interviews saying once that they didn't want to use some of the language they were asked to use, but there was a hassle over it. I wish family films could be family films, and that the industry would realize that not everyone out there has a garbage mouth.Other than this, I thought the film was fun, especially the ending. I don't think it deserved the low rating it was given by other critics.</p>
