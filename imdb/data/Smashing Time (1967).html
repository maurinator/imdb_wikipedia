<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't believe Leonard Maltin dissed this picture -- it's a rare gem of trippy brilliance, influential as hell on arbiters of style like "Absolutely Fabulous" and the "Austin Power" series.  Lynn Redgrave (!), fresh out of "Georgy Girl", bumbles through looking like a great big blonde lovable cow in a succession of astonishing wigs, while her costar Rita Tushingham (!!) veers back and forth from frumpy/frowny to slapstick/mime to The Face of the 60's.  The humor is broad and scatological, but cutting when its satire -- sample song lyric: "I can't sing, but I'm young!!"  If you can find it, grab it.</p>
