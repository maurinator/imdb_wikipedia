<h1>Kung Fu Cult Master (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A wild and rollicking martial arts fantasy extravaganza that features prized swords -- and swordsmen, a crazy monk attached to a rolling boulder (yup!), serious clan and cult rivalries, and lots of magic and flying.</p>
<p>Set during the Yuen Dynasty, many sects compete for possession of the two golden swords which contain the secret to dominance of the world of martial arts. The first faction, led by Shaolin, consists of Shaolin, Wu Tang, Ngo Mai, Kun Lun, Hung Tung and Wah Shan. The second is the Ming Sect, otherwise known as the Fire Sect or Evil Sect, led by branch leaders Queen of Purple Dragon, King of White Eagle, King of Gold Lion and King of Green Bat. A student of Wu Tang, befriends Gold Lion and marries the daughter of White Eagle. He is killed for the secret of the location of the missing sword. His infant son witnesses this and vows revenge on the heads of the sect. Unfortunately he has a jinx which prevents him from learning martial arts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an all star cast film with Wong Jin directing, so you can expect high caliber action, and production. It was probably the peak of silver age of Hong Kong cinema when this movie was made, and we see two gorgeous actresses Chingmy Yau, and Chun Man as the two lady leads, and Jet Li and Sammo Hung doing the male lead. The story is little contrived in the middle, but they save all the good actions until the end. Wong Jin's directing and production is good. There's always one more treat at each scene that makes watching this movie rewarding.I only wish that there are more actresses like Chingmy Yau these days, who are pretty and gorgeous at the same time. Jet Li saves all his talent until the very end. He was not so well known outside of Hong Kong back then. Sammo Hung is spot on as the master. All this makes this movie an entertaining piece.Good movie from the '90s that almost looks like it was made in the 21st century.</p>
