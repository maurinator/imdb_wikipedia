<h1>Teen Knight (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young teenager wins a contest for a "Medieval Adventure" from a soda company. The winners, plus a film crew from the soda company arrive at the castle for the adventure. During the night, a spell cast over 600 years prior brings the castle and all the people in it back to 1383. The evil Lord Drakin plans on retrying to take the castle. It is up to the group to stop him, and thereby return to the 20th century. They enlist the help of the former court magician, Percival, to help them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My only theory is that this movie was some sort of tax write-off for the producers.  Otherwise, how do you explain actors who seemingly have never rehearsed?  How do you explain a script that sounds like it was read off of a finished game of Scrabble?  How do you explain sets and effects that would make Ed Wood proud?The basic story is a kid who wins a trip to a medieval fantasy camp run by androids.  Other winners include Token Nerd, Token Snobby Rich Kid, Token Snobby Girl.  The film crew taping this camp for the sponsors of the contest include Token Nice Girl Who Is So Involved In Work But You Know Will Learn Not To Be So Uptight And Have More Fun By The End Of The Movie.As luck would have it, a giant storm sweeps over the land causing calamity (*cough* Jurassic Park *cough*).  The next morning our hero figures out in roughly two minutes that they've all been transported back to medieval times, wherein hijinks ensue.It seems as if whoever made this film has never seen a movie before and has no idea how to shoot, write, or pace one.  At no point did it seem like anyone knew or cared what was going to appear on screen.This is the worst movie I've seen that wasn't on Mystery Science Theatre.</p>
