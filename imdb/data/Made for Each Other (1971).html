<h1>Made for Each Other (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An eccentric woman meets an equally odd man at a group therapy session and they begin a relationship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Joe Bologna and Renee Taylor hit a homer with this one. Unfortunately, the critics must have been busy at the concession stands when they rounded the bases. Where is the DVD? You might not find a better acted script or one that seems so believable despite its over-the-top characters. Giggy and Pandora are unforgettable as evidenced by the resonance the film left with me even after these 35 years since its release, the first and last time I saw it. The scene in which Pandora meets Giggy's parents and relatives at dinner is a classic. Director Robert Bean allowed the top notch cast to relate as they would in a real life situation, and it worked wonderfully. Joe Bologna and Renee Taylor are under-appreciated national treasures!</p>
