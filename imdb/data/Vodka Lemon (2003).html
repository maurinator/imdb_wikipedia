<h1>Vodka Lemon (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a remote, isolated Yazidi Kurdish village in post-Soviet Armenia, Hamo, a widower with a pitiful pension and three worthless sons, travels daily to his wife's grave. There he meets the lovely Nina, who is communing with her late husband. The two are penniless--she works in a local bar that is about to close down, while he has been forced to start selling his meager possessions. All seems hopelessly bleak, yet when Hamo begins to court Nina, their unexpected love revitalizes them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is at best a distant cousin to the Eastern European Life Really Sucks genre. The story of the slow dissolution of a society, where the young move out and the old quietly die (often before the grave) plays out so frequently in Western art houses and film festivals. Is it a matter of exporting things you already have a surplus of? Anyway, nothing much happens. The few instances of "magic" aren't supported by the overall structure and theme. This is a snapshot of a dying town, somewhere out on the suburban steppes, just waiting to fade slowly into the white background of the near-eternal northern winter.</p>
