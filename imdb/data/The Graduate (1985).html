<h1>The Graduate (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mona has finally graduated from college. Tony throws a glee party for her and skilfully switches the camera to flirtatious Carla. Mona's professor Jake Emerson enlists her for a set-up test to prove shoe manufacturer Sid Hadley is among the many employers who discriminate against seniors. She tells the family only she's applying, so Tony convinces Angela she should pull strings with ex-client Hadley to get her hired. It works, alas, so now Mona is stuck with a job she didn't want and a failed test.</p>
