<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Woody Allen's masterpiece will always be "Annie Hall."  What is most remarkable today about this film is the way Allen presents it.  It's a movie about a relationship.  But rather than taking a linear approach, Allen plays with time.  We see the middle, the begining, and the end. And not always in that order.  Allen also breaks the fourth wall a lot and has many dream sequences and asides which add to the complexity of the characters.  This is a highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie is not about romance in the way that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is.  Rather, "Annie Hall" is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny and heartbreaking and always classic.  "Love fades," indeed.</p>
