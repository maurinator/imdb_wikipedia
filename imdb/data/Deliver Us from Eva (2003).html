<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I never got a chance to go see this movie when it hit the theaters. I rented it not knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have minded paying the price of the movie ticket to see this movie. It's not all that glamorous, but what it is is a nice feel-good, respectable movie. Gabrielle Union does a nice job playing a rude, obnoxious, man-hating sister by the name of Eva. At times she takes it over the top, but that's acting and that's what she gets paid to do. Eva is bent on taking care of her little sister's who all lean to her for advice instead of their men. The sister's love Eva and listen to her as if her word were the gospel. The men, on the other hand, hate her guts and want nothing more than to see her leave town. She often interferes with her sisters' relationships and makes it a point to drive her sisters' men crazy. So, in order to bring proper order to their respected relationships the men plot to get Eva out of their lives. Thus the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a smooth-talking playa with serious game. The men talk Ray into dating Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and thus the story begans with two people falling in love with each other that weren't supposed to fall in love. That's when things get messy for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the movie were a little outrageous and the ending was not the best, but all in all it was still a pretty good movie. I've read some of the reviews on this movie and other movies as well. My thing is that if you want real life situations, go watch a drama or a real life story. This is comedy...comedy's not supposed to be real. It's really an escape from reality. Don't we all need that right about now? Anyway, besides the ending, this movie was well done with the supporting actors doing a great job of playing out their respected roles. Furthermore, the women in this movie are pretty fine. Also, LL did a nice job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He didn't over play his part, but he made it believable.</p>
