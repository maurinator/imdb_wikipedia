<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now this is a combination that has been responsible for giving many memorable movies to the Indian cinema...And Sharaabi is a gem of a cinema from the so called "Golden period of Indian cinema" 26 years down the line, the movie is far more intriguing, entertaining and relevant than the modern era Blockbuster movies of bollywood. Its a kind of movie which can please each and everyone. Comedy,drama,action,music,acting,emotion and whatever you would seek for are all properly embedded in a nicely written plot. Amitabh Bachchan has given a towering performance and he is the best we have around and the witty one liners and shayaris are also doing no harm to his presence. Om prakash as Munshiji is good and you will feel for his death in the movie.But the lack of subtlety in his character works against him. Jaya Prada is beautiful and that all I've to say for her. Pran may seem to be too harsh but its all for making the contrast when he's transformed.Much said It would be better if you Catch this movie and then evaluate this reviews.</p>
