<h1>Skin Deep (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Zach Hutton is a womanizing, drunken, allelic writer whose life seems to be falling apart at the seams. He's still in love with his ex-wife (whose family can't stand him), writer's block is keeping him from completing his latest novel, and he repeatedly finds himself in trouble of one sort or another with the law, ex-girlfriends, and jealous boyfriends.</p>
<p>Blake Edwards's return to the male-in-meltdown territory he explored in "10" and "That's Life," stars John Ritter as unemployed writer named Zach, who is not only suffering from writer's block, but his drinking is out of control, as is his obsessive womanizing, and, not surprisingly, his wife wants to end their marriage. To add to his problems, his house has just burned down, and his agent is knocking at death's door. But since this is a Blake Edwards comedy, Zach has enough charm and relative affluence to continue his pursuits, which the director regards with a bemused detachment. One of his girlfriends sets his piano on fire, and another gets him to wear a glow-in-the-dark condom, allowing him to engage in a condom duel with her jealous, similarly clad rock-star boyfriend. Eventually, Zach turns to fatherly bartender Barney, who should have long ago cut off his bar tab, and psychiatrist Dr. Westford, and both tell him to stop destroying himself through drink. Ritter rings some surprisingly complex changes in the wildly farcical film, and, in the condom battle, participates in one of the funniest moments ever committed to celluloid while suggesting an interesting new subtext.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Ritter makes Zach and the film memorable. It's more or less a one man show by him, though the character hardly has an element of heroism in it. He wonderfully transforms himself into Zach Hutton, a writer by profession with a weakness for drinks and women. He faces the fury of boyfriends of the women, and later, the revenge of the girls themselves, after they break up.The movie progresses with hilarious sequences, at times slap-stick. Be sure not to miss the dialogues, for there are many instances when humour makes its presence in the most unexpected of situations. Altogether non stop entertainment is warrantied..</p>
