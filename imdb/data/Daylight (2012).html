<h1>Daylight (2012)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>First person adventure game of the "find hidden objects" variety that also features other types of puzzles. In a dark near future, vampires legally live in the open among humans. Dahlia, a high class imposing goth vampire with a sense of humor, is asked by her elder to investigate a strange murder case where a vampire supposedly killed someone in broad daylight. Since sunlight is deadly to vampires, this might mean that the perpetrator had access to a legendary mythical potion that allows vampires to walk under the sun for a period of time. A recently disbanded macabre vampire circus troop may have something to do with it. To track down each member of this troop, Dahlia must look for hidden objects, find ways to get various necessary items and talk to various strange people, vampires and ghouls she crosses path with. A funny odd young man who may or may not work for the government keeps popping up every now and then, and a sect of insane ancient evil vampires is killing anyone who might get the potion before them.</p>
