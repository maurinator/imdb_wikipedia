<h1>The Valachi Papers (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Joe Valachi (Charles Bronson) has a price put on his head by Don Vito Genovese (Lino Ventura), he must take desperate steps to protect himself while in prison. An unsuccessful attempt to slit his throat puts him over the edge to break the sacred code of silence.</p>
<p>It's 1962. Fifty-nine year old Joe Valachi is convicted for drug trafficking and imprisoned. Inside, someone is out to kill him. He learns that it is his mob boss, Don Vito Genovese, who is in the same penitentiary as him, since Genovese mistakenly believes he was the snitch who put him behind bars. Because of the bounty on his head from his own, a federal agent named Ryan convinces Valachi really to be a mob informant in return for safety inside. Valachi tells a story that starts in 1929, when he was first imprisoned in Sing Sing and met Tony Bender, who introduced him into the life of the mob. Through internal struggles for control of the mob, Valachi remained faithful to the mob family, including through Genovese's reign starting in the late 1930s. As Valachi nears the end of his story, he learns that what has happened in the time leading up to and during his latest incarceration was by no accident, which is all the more troubling to him if only for the safety of his family including his wife Maria, the daughter of a mobster, who he was only able to marry through assistance by Genovese.</p>
<p>The gangster Joseph "Joe" Valachi has worked for the Mafia for more than thirty years in New York. When he has been imprisoned for fifteen years, he learns that the mobster Don Vito Genovese is offering a reward for his life. Without any alternative other than stay in the solitaire, he accepts the DA offer of protection. In return, he has to disclose the secrets of the Cosa Nostra.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Valachi Papers was shot at a time when common wisdom had it that gangster pictures were box-office poison, so the very American tale of Charles Bronson's Cosa Nostra soldier spilling the beans on his life in the mob in return for protection by the Feds ended up being shot at Dinocitta in Italy with French money and an English director (Terence Young, reunited with Dr No villains Joseph Wiseman Â– wonderfully hammy here - and Anthony Dawson) only to end up being discounted as a Godfather ripoff when Coppola's film became a surprise huge hit. Based on Joe Valachi's congressional committee testimony that lifted the veil on the way the mob worked and was organised after years of denial of its very existence by J. Edgar Hoover, it's a well-crafted and enjoyable saga with none of the operatic grandeur that Coppola, Leone and De Palma would bring to the genre. There's not much in the way of historical or social context, more a catalogue of hits and internecine feuding, but it's done with some flair and is surprisingly entertaining. Bronson makes a good lead, with decent support from Walter Chiari and Lino Ventura, both surprisingly well dubbed. Unfortunately the dire Mrs Bronson, Jill Ireland, is along too, but she's not in it enough to do any damage.Cinema Club's UK widescreen transfer and Sony's US DVD are the only two versions worth picking up, however.</p>
