<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the funniest beach party movies made by AIP (or anybody), with a great cast and pretty funny script with no story involved.  Such as it is involves the arrival of the Potato Bug (Avalon in a double role), a John Lennon-esque Britisher that all the beach girls swoon over.  Annette seems to decide the endless summer might never end, and jumps ship to the Bug.  Frankie and the Bug have to drag race it out at Don Ricle's aptly named "Big Drag" -- Rickles is anything but a drag, constantly mugging with the lines they throw him and everyone else's too.  Frankie Avalon's double performance may not go down in history as the modern equivalent of John Barrymore, but it's all good fun worth a hundred minutes of my lifetime.  Looks like Mike Myers might have been watching this one pretty closely too.</p>
