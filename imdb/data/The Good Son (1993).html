<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In many ways this is just a standard thriller.  How I loathe the word "thriller".  It suggests roller-coasters; and the genre it denotes, at its best, deals in quiet tension.  Where was I?  Yes: standard thriller.  A is really an evil person, intent on performing great harm in the future; B knows this but can't convince anyone else.  I heard that sigh.  But make A and B children, on the verge of adolescence, and not only is this tired formula invigorated, but it makes a great deal more sense.  (Especially if B is in the slightly awkward position of a cousin on an extended visit.) The creaky old scenes where B goes to the police and either he is strangely incoherent or the police are strangely obtuse, are gone.  There is now a perfectly good reason why B can't go to the police, or indeed anyone.  Nor is there anything strange about the obtuseness of A's parents.  The rotten adult seems so commonplace that we scarcely bat an eyelid; the rotten child, who is in fact far more commonplace, we like to pretend doesn't exist.So I'm glad Hollywood took this step.  I also, for the most part, like the way the step has been taken.  B has no accomplices - he must battle A alone and his plight is keenly felt.  There's an air of plausibility about itall.  Elijah Wood is an unusually good boy, Macaulay Culkin is an unusually bad boy; both look perfectly real.  (Wood, who has the harder task, does especially well.)The climax - or what is meant to be the climax - is HIGHLY contrived.  It will probably come as a shock that the writers chose something at once so obvious and so ludicrous.  The mood of the audience I saw this with - it may just have been my mood - was one of grudging acceptance, granted only because we had been treated so well in the events leading up to it.</p>
