<p>A man sees a way out of monotony by way of an impulsive crime.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A bookkeeper named Gus steals a check and buys a new house to surprise his wife. When he comes home, he finds his wife in the bath with another man. Later on this day, his boss calls him and asks for the checks.That's the beginning. As you can see, the film has dark humor. It seems as if whenever Gus tries to be smart, he fails inevitably.The son shows a lot of the Gus' inner world. Also the atmosphere, the airplanes going somewhere or the rain outside reflect his inner world. The grainy black and white production amplifies the dark perspective.I liked the movie. It is intense. All you need is look and be open to understand what moves the character. It's a movie about hope in a conformist's world.</p>
