<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Reena is a young Indian American lesbian who lives and works in New York. Her sister Sarita, who is happily married, discovers that she is infertile. Reena offers to be a surrogate mother for her sister's baby, hoping to improve her relationship with their mother, who disapproves of Reena's sexual orientation. Reena has second thoughts when her girlfriend Lisa feels left out.</p>
<p>When married Sarita discovers she can't have children, for the first time in their lives Reena can do something her perfect sister Sarita can't: get pregnant. Obsessed with helping her sister and winning her mom's approval, Reena decides she'll have the baby and then give it to her sister and brother-in-law, Mitch. Now she just needs to convince her commitment-phobic girlfriend to go along with the idea. With Indian traditions on the one hand and modern New York City values on the other, Chutney Popcorn is a provocative new comedy that shows you can find family somewhere between the two.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film which I saw an early cut of was refreshing, captivating, and needs to be seen.A brave combination of culture, family and sexual orientation, blended into a universal story of poeple.Breaking stereotypes and wholly unpredictable, i can't wait to see her next project!!</p>
