<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Michael Winner has directed the great Charles Bronson in several films, all of which can be described shortly as 'bad-ass'. Their collaborations include some truly great films including the 1974 vigilante masterpiece "Death Wish" and the hard-boiled Western "Chato's Land" (1972). All the films that the actor/director team Bronson/Winner made together are highly entertaining, and while "The Stone Killer" certainly isn't one of their best collaborations (in fact, its arguably their weakest besides the hugely fun but very silly "Death Wish 3") it is definitely another testosterone-driven flick that will not leave my fellow Bronson-fans bored.Bronson stars as Lou Torrey, a tough New York detective who gets transferred to LA. Soon after arriving in LA, hints lead Torrey to a Mafia-Don's plot to use Vietnam Veterans as assassins... My fellow reviewers seem to either love or hate this film, the division being between Bronson fans and non-Bronson fans. As a huge fan of Charles Bronson, I tend to be on the 'love it' side, though, as mentioned above, it is nowhere near one of the most interesting flicks of his. It pales in comparison to other Bronson/Winner Vehicles such as the first two "Death Wish" films, "Chato's Land" or "The Mechanic", but then, these are all great 70s cult favorites, and while "The Stone Killer" is, in my opinion not quite as good, it is still a decent enough film that promises action and bad-assery. Bronson is his great self once again. To me personally, the man's presence alone makes it impossible for a film not to be at least entertaining. Apart from Bronson, the film features another truly great cult-actor, the magnificent Martin Balsam, who plays the role of a mob boss. Michael Winner has been unfairly scorned by critics throughout his career. Fact is, that the man is actually an outstanding director of gritty cult-cinema, who has been successful in any genre he has worked in, be it Action/Thriller ("Death Wish", "The Mechanic"), Western ("Chato's Land", "Lawman") or supernatural Horror ("The Sentinel"). Some folks only seem to be satisfied when they can claim intellectual superiority over other people's work. Some people seem to complain about this film's lacking depth and not bringing up any ideas. I wonder what these folks expect. This is a Bronson flick: It's meant to be hard-hitting, bad-ass entertainment, not melodramatic drivel. "The Stone Killer" features Bronson, loads of action and is filmed in typically stylish 70s style. What else could one ask for? Recommended to all my fellow Bronson fans.</p>
