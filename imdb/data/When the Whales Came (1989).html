<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This one sneaked up on me a Thursday afternoon and the Fox Movie Channel tossed it in. God bless 'em for that. Hope they repeat it soon. (They have that tendency).This film about life on a remote, barren English island during WWI (it is by no means a war flick) is, in words of one, MAGNIFICENT. The direction, superb photography, excellent music (unobtrusive, unlike too many of today's noisy movies) and the acting all combined to choke you up, or bring tears to your eyes, depending on your level of emotion.This well told, beautiful tale has the big plus of some fine, fine performers, particularly the youngsters Helen Pearce and Max Rennie. For whatever ungodly reason neither of these two achieved any kind of fame. Young Max only made one other movie, "Hard Road," while Helen did nothing else.Both youngsters received the Young Artists Award, an honorary but justified recognition.Paul Scofield and Helen Mirren the entire cast were heavily responsible for the success of this G-rated movie.The accents were not too heavy so, no problem in understanding. It was a tad slow at first, but that is nit-picking. Overall, it can be rated as one of the best movies of its kind hell, any kind ever made.</p>
