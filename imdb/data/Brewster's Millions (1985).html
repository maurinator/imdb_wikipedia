<h1>Brewster's Millions (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brewster is a minor league baseball player. Unknown to him, he had a (recently deceased) rich relative. In order to test if Brewster knows the value of money, he is given the task of disposing of $30m in 30 days. Brewster isn't allowed to have any assets to show for the $30m or waste the money in any way. If successful, Brewster gets to inherit $300m. The biggest problem of all however, is that Brewster can't tell anyone what he's doing, so everyone thinks he's crazy. Add to this the fact that if he fails, two scheming trustees will get their hands on the money, Brewster's task is not an easy one.</p>
<p>Montgomery "Monty" Brewster is a baseball player who has been going back and forth from the minors to the majors back to the minors for nearly 15 years. After getting into a brawl in a bar, he and his friend and team mate, Spike Nolan, they end up in jail. They learn that their team has not only decided not to bail them out but to cut them. At his hearing Monty doesn't know what to do but a man who has been following him for sometime appears in court and offers to pay his bail. Monty assumes that he's a baseball scout but when they arrive at where he is bringing them, Monty is taken to a law office and informed that he is the sole heir of a man who is one of the richest men in the country, who is also his long lost uncle. His uncle's last will and testament is that Monty must spend 30 millions dollars in 30 days, which if he accomplishes, he will get 300 million. But at the end of 30 days he must not own anything. He also must not give the money away and must not destroy anything valuable and he also cannot tell anyone why he is spending all this money. He thinks that he's on his way to doing that but Spike unwittingly invests some of the money and recoups everything that Monty has spent. And he also doesn't exactly have the support of the lawyers, cause is he fails they will take control of the estate and administer it into a charity and give themselves a healthy fee for handling it. And also a lot of people especially the woman he is attracted to, thinks he is jerk.</p>
<p>A minor-league baseball player has to spend $30,000,000 in thirty days in order to inherit $300,000,000. However, he's not allowed to tell anyone about the deal.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is consistent with it's humor throughout.  So many 80s films start out with an original idea but seem to lose site of it halfway through as it becomes a love story.  Not this film, Brewster is trying to spend that money right up until the clock chimes midnight.  One of my favorites by Richard Pryor.  John Candy only added to it's hilarity.</p>
