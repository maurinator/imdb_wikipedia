<h1>Little Tragedies (1979)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember seeing this one when I was 6-7 first time. I liked it very much then. Perfect and charisma actors, great words of Alexandre Pushkin, the mysticism and some horror inside. First of all these series include some brilliant people of those days, such as Visotskiy, Smaktunovskiy.. Good directing, costumes, outstanding music by great composer Alfred Shnitke-altogether is a real monument for A S Pushkin, the most respected afro-Russian poet. The best Pushkin screening ever. One can hear and see true life depth here. the original stories mean the most disturbing questions that Pushkin head in his mind for a long time , so the film gives some answers on the destiny of poet and shows the fears that he was struggling with all his life.</p>
