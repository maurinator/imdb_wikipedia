<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A black uniformed policeman is recruited by a devious drug enforcement agent to infiltrate a smuggling organization seeking to expand into designer drugs. This 'ugly side of the war on drugs' explores the context of race, identity and hypocrisy within a brutal and alienating investigation.</p>

Russell shall work his way up from the bottom undercover, until he reaches the boss. First step is to get the lawyer and hobby dealer David Jason to trust him. Jason wants to switch to legal designer drugs, but hasn't got the capital yet, so Steven's ambitious help is welcomed. To keep his cover, Steven has to go farer than any officer before: he has to really sell the drugs he buys, and some day even eliminate a competitor... and gets problems seeing the line between the good and the bad.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie exceeded my expectations.I thought it was going to be a big action movie, but it was quite different. It is a very dark thriller.While it still had some action this wasn't the main focus. It is very story orientated. Plenty of good twists in the plot line.The acting was good. Except for at the beginning when there is a kid acting but he was still OK. Laurence Fishburne did well as past reviews have mentioned. Another good actor in this one was Jeff Goldblum, the Lawyer. The rest of the cast were good as well.Overall I thought it was an interesting and dark thriller which should prove entertaining even with some brutal violence.</p>
