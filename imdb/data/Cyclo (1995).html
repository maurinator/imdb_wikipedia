<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen this movie for several times, and can't get enough of it. There are a lot of reviews here, I mostly can agree with (redanit and others). So I will just add some thoughts of mine. The camerawork, composition, acting and plot(s) are all absolutely exceptional, the (Vietnamese) cultural aspects about family (father-mother-child) are omni-present (mentioned by redanit, also "the egg"); HCMC is a really captivating,noisy and ugly city in this movie, but Tran Anh Hung also shows the "other side" of Vietnam in his new one, "À la verticale de l'été", again on family and relation. Tran Anh Hung has created a real masterpiece with Cyclo (Xich-Lo), worth 10 for sure ! See it and you will know why Vietnam has banned this one !</p>
