<h1>Summer School (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A high-school gym teacher has big plans for the summer, but is forced to cancel them to teach a "bonehead" English class for misfit goof-off students. Fortunately, his unconventional brand of teaching fun field trips begins to connect with them, and even inspires ardor in some.</p>
<p>Mr. Freddy Shoop, the high school coach, is as unenthusiastic as the weakest pupils when the vice-principal forces him to take charge of the dreaded summer school program. Shoop tries to bribe the pupils, but gets to know and understand them better, even comes to care for their futures when helped by a motivated colleague he has a crush on.</p>
<p>Thirty-five year old Freddy Shoop, a high school Phys Ed teacher at Oceanfront High School, chose teaching as a profession solely because he thought it would be an easy job, having the entire summer off. He does not take his job seriously. Just before he is to head off on his summer vacation to Hawaii with his girlfriend Kim, he is blackmailed by the school's Vice-Principal, the officious Phil Gills, to teach the remedial English class during summer school. The class is populated by a bunch of underachievers, who have just failed the English skills test, which they have to retake and pass at the end of their summer school term. Like the regular school year, Freddy doesn't take this job seriously, which is made all the more easy for him as the students don't seem to care. Gills extends that blackmail to make Freddy need to care with his status as tenured teacher, the review for which is for this upcoming school year, on the line. The students need to pass the test as a collective or else he loses not only that tenure, but his job, period. Beyond Gills' threats, Freddy has to find a way to motivate the students. In the end, he may find that getting his students to pass the test to keep his job may not be his primary goal. Through it all, Robin Bishop is literally by his side as the American History teacher in the class next to his. Beyond Robin wanting to see the students and Freddy succeed, Freddy has in mind her as a replacement for Kim as his girlfriend, which may be difficult as Robin is already dating another man, namely Gills.</p>
<p>When the teacher who is suppose to teach the Summer remedial class, decides not to do it. The Vice-Principal, who is responsible for Summer School, ropes Freddy Shoop into teaching it, and he is not an academic teacher. And all of the students are not exactly willing to meet him half way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Summer School" is a prime example of a film that over-achieves.  It appears to be a typical teen comedy, but its screenplay is so smart that it is hard dislike.  Carl Reiner's direction is substantial as he never tries to make the film more than it is.  Mark Harmon does some of the best work of his ho-hum career as a high school physical education instructor who must teach a group of lazy students who all have more personality than brains.  Kirstie Alley stars as the next-door teacher who teaches Harmon a few things about education.  All of the students have their moments as well.  However, it is Dean Cameron as "Chainsaw" who steals every scene and makes the film fun throughout.  A strange over-achiever.  3.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
