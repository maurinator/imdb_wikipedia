<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>" for the happiness of the people Im ready to kill or die " Simhadri movie revolves around this principle. The lead role in this movie is done by Jr.NTR, I have to admit that he has done a very decent performance in this film. And director Rajamouli known for his continuous hits maintains his standard.This movie contains hardcore action which is added for the fans of N.T.R so anyone who are not familiar with the mass of the hero might find the film extreme. I was really impressed with the story of the movie Mr.Rajamouli has done a fantastic job in this aspect. Main attraction in the movie is its interval band and its flash back fights. Another big asset to the movie is its music it is perfect the especially the background score is too good. Another good thing in the movie is its comedy track, even though lot of action and emotional scenes are running there is sufficient amount of comedy in the film. Finally Simhadri is a visual treat for the fans and movie lovers. But the people who are unfamiliar with the mass of the hero might find the film very extreme.</p>
