<h1>The Sea Gull (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Film adaptation of Anton Chekhov's story of life in rural Russia during the latter part of the 19th century. An aging actress Arkidana pays summer visits to her brother Sorin and son Konstantin on a country estate. On one occasion she brings with her Trigorin, a successful novelist. Nina, a free and innocent girl on a neighboring estate, falls in love with Trigorin. As Trigorin lightly consumes and rejects Nina, so the actress all her life has consumed and rejected her son, who loves Nina. The victims are destroyed, the sophisticates continue on their way.</p>
<p>Konstantin is an emotional and passionate young man. He is an aspiring writer, who wants to write on his own terms, and not in any conventional manner. He has written a play, which is unconventional both in structure and theme. He wants to show to it to a small group of people at a makeshift outdoor theater at his Uncle Sorin's lakeside estate in the Russian countryside, that group which includes his actress mother Arkadina, and her lover, famed writer Trigorin. Arkadina and Trigorin are both self-absorbed with their own fame, and dismiss Konstantin's writing ability. The only person who seems to have any faith in his writing is Dorn, Sorin's doctor. Konstantin has gotten Nina, the daughter of a neighboring landowner, to appear as the lead in the play. Konstantin loves Nina, his love which is unrequited. Although she carries on with a poor local schoolteacher named Medvedenko, Masha, the daughter of Sorin's estate's bailiff, loves Konstantin, that love which too is unrequited. Nina wants to become an actress, but seems more enthralled with the idea of celebrity than being a real actress. The question becomes whether any of these individuals can reach ultimate happiness with their competing desires.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why is that art is not appreciated? This film was directed by the very same Sidney Lumet of DOG DAY AFTERNOON, TWELVE ANGRY MAN etc fame, and it gets a 5 from 38 IMDb voters!! Sidney Lumet captured the essence of Chekhov's Russia as no other English speaking director ever has. James Mason, Simone Signoret and David Warner are all superb in their parts, but Vanessa Redgrave as Nina crawls into the skin of the character and delivers (yet another one of her) absolutely brilliant portrayal(s) Her rendition of the play within a play - not particularly well received by her mother (Signoret was truly a diamond) is heartbreaking and the symbolism of the sea gull and Nina herself fuse into an eternal unit. Perhaps Vanessa Redgrave, despite so many accolades, is the most underrated British actress. Her versatility is astounding. [Compare her in this with her portrayal of Andromache in Cacoyannis' WOMEN OF TROY.]  But the interplay between all the characters, the subtleties of their longings, passions and disappointments are supremely brought to life albeit on the silver screen by Mr Lumet. Any serious filmgoer/lover should see this beautiful, touching and thought-provoking film. Bravo!</p>
