<h1>Time After Time (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The aging Swift family of one brother, Jasper, and three sisters, April, May and June, are forced to live together in the run-down family mansion and they all get on each others nerves. One-eyed Jasper is the only one who does the cooking and he has occasional meetings with a monk from the nearby monastery. April was left some money when her husband died and is now practically deaf. May is a spinster who gives talks on flower arranging and also steals ornaments. The youngest, still called Baby June, was an avid horsewoman, but now relies on her farmhand Christy Lucey to train and ride her horse. One day, to their surprise, cousin Leda comes to visit and elicits various embarrassing family secrets. Leda, who is half Jewish and used to live in Vienna, stayed with the family when she was a teenager, but they thought she died in a concentration camp in the war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What I liked most about this movie was the synergy between actors. Sibling rivalry amongst the Swift family has been a driving force that has placed a wedge between the sisters and brother ever since they were children. Jealousies so strong that it engulfs their spirits well into their golden years. The movie begins with all the siblings living together in the home they were raised in somewhere in England. Each in their 60's, the movie flashes back to a sibling's childhood experience when a point of reference needs to be made to support a jealous or angry thought one sibling might be feeling toward another in real time. Just a really funny host of sibling competitiveness that at times explodes into a pretty severe tounge lashing amongst sisters and brother.  However all done with true English dignity and reserve. Petty jealousies and rivalry is the order of the day for this movie. But did I mention family secrets involving....s_x.  That's where the movie starts to get really good.  When a much disliked, nosey, gossiping cousin comes to visit with the sole intention of stirring up ONE of the families most guarded s_x_al secrets.  Yes, a cast of senior actors. Resulting in the acting at it's best.</p>
