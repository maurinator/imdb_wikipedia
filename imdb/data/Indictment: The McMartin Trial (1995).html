<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a real-life court case, the film finds members of the McMartin family on trial for alleged sexual molestation and abuse of children at their well-regarded preschool. Publicity-seeking attorney Danny Davis initially defends the McMartins for selfish reasons, but he slowly begins to believe that they are innocent. Davis has his work cut out for him, however, since the media have demonized the family, and prosecuting lawyer Lael Rubin is a tough opponent.</p>
<p>The McMartin family's lives are turned upside down when they are accused of serious child molestation. The family run a school for infants. An unqualified child cruilty "expert" videotapes the children describing outrageous stories of abuse. One of the most expensive and long running trails in US legal history, exposes the lack of evidence and unprofessional attitudes of the finger pointers which kept one of the accused in jail for over 5 years without bail.</p>
<p>Who really decides who is guilty or innocent among us? Where is justice when a person's life hangs in the balance? Indictment: The McMartin Trial looks at these and other questions during a trial whose nature would strike fear into the hearts of parents anywhere and tear apart the lives of the accused. A family dedicated to looking after young children are arrested for the horrifying crime of child molestation. However their guilt or innocence was not determined swiftly by their fellow countrymen in a court of law. Rather it was determined by the media and thus making up the minds of a whole country. The system we live in and who holds the power is exposed leaving a family devastated in its wake.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie reveals the nature of man so well. It is a portrait of us human beings under pressure, psychologically, socially, economically and egoistically. It is mindboggling in this movie to see how we demand scapegoats, even in the name of justice. There's one line in the movie that sums the problem up, 'People doesn't listen to God. People listen to TV.' The power of media is being displayed like never before and we get an insight in how the justicesystem is influenced by this. The movie deals with one of the most difficult subjects there is to the modern day american, childrape, and in the light of this we get to follow how blinded we become in the search of someone to release our fears, angers and frustrations on. The McMartin Trial should be mandatory in psychology and socialpsychology classes. It is brilliant, tremendously touching and after the film is over you might have some serious pondering ahead of you. This is not entertainment, this is real life!</p>
