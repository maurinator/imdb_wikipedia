<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lots of good gags, but the situations are just too stupid to believe.  It also has a few new gross-outs to make you want to spit your popcorn out.Knowing the ending won't make a difference.  If you're going to see this, don't let anyone tell you the gags.  That and the acting are what pull this movie along.</p>
