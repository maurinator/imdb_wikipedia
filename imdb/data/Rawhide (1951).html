<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was a teenager when I first saw this movie at the Carmel Theater in Hollywood. Tyrone Power was a WW II hero, and was a personal favorite from the 1940 western "The Mark of Zorro."Hugh Marlowe had a nice, sympathetic role the year before in "All About Eve." So consider this teenager's surprise when he learns that Hugh is the bad guy.Tyrone and Susan Hayward have appeared in several film together and here make a very good team once again. The rousing opening music theme was used before in the film "Brigham Young." Both films were directed by Henry Hathaway who might have said, "Let's use that music from Brigham Young." The strange thing is that there are different music credits for each film, so someone is not getting his just rewards and someone is getting credit undeservedly.A previous review of this movie stated that this film was so predictable. Well, in the 50's all the heroes survived in motion pictures. The fun is here you don't know how the hero will survive (without a gun) and how he will save the others.There is real suspense here and fear for the safety of the baby. This film is an excellent effort by both cast and crew and truly deserves a viewing.</p>
