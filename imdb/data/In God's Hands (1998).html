<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In God's Hands is the story of big wave riders that go all over the globe searching to ride bigger and bigger waves. The story mostly follows Shane Dorian and his obsession with surfing. It also follows how they train for waves like that.</p>
<p>Three pro surfers - gifted Shane, once-great Mickey and rising young star Keoni travel to Madagascar, Bali and Hawaii in search for the ultimate wave.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My boyfriend is a surfer and one night I rented this movie for us to watch. When he was out of the room I started it and as soon as he heard the waves crash he ran into the room.  The movie is great because it has great action to keep the guys interested but there is an underlying romance between the extremely gorgeous Patrick Shane Dorian and a really pretty costar that makes it a good movie for couples to watch.  My boyfriend was very appreciative and I'm sure any other guy would be too.</p>
