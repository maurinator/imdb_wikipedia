<h1>The Pirates of Penzance (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie is an adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operetta of the same name, with parts of other of their operettas stirred in. Frederic has fallen in love with sweet innocent Mabel. Yet his vocation is an impediment to their union. Perhaps the situation can be rectified by his old nurse, Ruth, who made a dreadful blunder years before. A highlight is the song/dance A Policeman's Lot is Not a Happy One.</p>
<p>Fredric was meant to be an apprentice to a pilot but his maid mistakenly makes him an apprentice to a pirate. He is ready to leave the Pirates of Penzance. When his maid pleads him to take her with him, he agrees but shortly after he meets the daughters of the major general and falls madly in love with them, so he rejects his maid Ruth. After they say no to loving him for he was a pirate, the fairest of them all, Mabel agrees to love him. But something stirs up in the story and he and his sense of duty as a pirate are stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>Frederic, son of a wealthy 19th century man was to be apprenticed to a pilot, but due to a hard-of-hearing nursery maid, was instead apprenticed to a pirate. Not just any pirate, but the Pirate King, leader of the not-so-fierce "Pirates of Penzance". But now his indentures are over, Frederic's sense of duty calls him to rid the seas of these rather simple ruffians. Despite their track record, the pirates believe that they have an ace up their collective sleeve...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am a true G & S Aficionado but this surprised and delighted me.  The cast are brilliant but Kevin Kline has the edge.  Agile, in great voice, lots of humour and quick, funny bits in his performance (blink and you miss them). His dancing and acrobatics are superb.  The police also had me howling with laughter along with their police dogs and the major general romping through the fields with the pirates singing UNDERWATER  in the babbling brook has to be a classic.  This scene has to be seen to be believed.  Bravo, cast !! This should have had a lot more publicity.  I would adore seeing it in the large theatre, at least we had "Topsy Turvy" this year. This Pirate is fun for all ages.</p>
