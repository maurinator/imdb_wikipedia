<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film version keeps much of the eroticism in Sir Richard Burton's original translation, which previous movie treatments saw fit to water down Great care was taken in the details: it was shot on location (Africa and the Middle East) and a dark skinned girl was cast as the princess The acting is extremely good, and the stories connect in and out in intriguing fashion...The film selects some of the more popular of the Arabian Nights stories, but intertwines them in strange ways Like the original, many stories lead into other stories and again into others One of the most erotic sequences is when two supernatural beings decide to play a trick on a virginal girl and boy The beings make each young person seduce the other while he or she is asleep In another scene, one of the heroes finds himself in a pool with a group of very pretty, very nude Arabian women, who tease and tickle him into an intense joy</p>
