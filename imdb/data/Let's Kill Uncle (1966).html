<h1>Let's Kill Uncle (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A 12-year-old orphan who has just inherited a fortune is trapped on an island with his uncle, a former British intelligence commander who intends to kill him. A young girl is the boy's only ally against the sarcastic uncle, who uses hypnotism, a pool of sharks, fire, and poisonous mushrooms as weapons.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Imaginative lad, orphaned and living on an isolated (some say haunted!) island with his uncle, learns quickly that his bug-eyed relative wants him dispatched permanently in order to cash in on the lad's five-million dollar inheritance. The boy then involves his bickering playmate in turning the tables on the nefarious grown-up, who seems to take delight in this deadly game of cat-and-mouse. Adapted from a novel by Rohan O'Grady, this William Castle thriller is curious and intriguing without being provocative. The kids plot to poison Uncle with mushrooms but are somehow thwarted, while Uncle--armed with a can of gasoline--attempts to set the two on fire (but how would he explain this to the authorities?). You absolutely cannot look for logic in a Castle screamer...but imagine how good (if not great) his films might have been with a little smarts! *1/2 from ****</p>
