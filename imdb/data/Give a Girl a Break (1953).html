<h1>Give a Girl a Break (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The star of an upcoming Broadway production, Janet Hallson, walks out during rehersals. The producers of the show, Ted Sturgis, Leo Belney and Bob Dowdy begin to search a replacement. After a quick audition, each favors someone else: Madelyn Corlane, Joanna Moss, Suzie Doolittle. The rest of the movie tells in a series of musical and dance scenes how they finally pick ...</p>
<p>Janet Hallson is the star of Felix Jordan's musical revue "Give a Girl a Break", which is in rehearsals. With only weeks until the opening, Janet quits the show over a disagreement with the dance director, Ted Sturgis, who refuses to treat her like the prima donna she believes she is. Knowing that all the other star performers are already booked, Felix decides to cancel the production. Ted, however, convinces him that he would be able to find a talented unknown to fill the part in an open casting call, which would provide great publicity for the show itself. After the open casting call, the decision makers have it narrowed down to three girls, each who has a different look and a different strength with which they come into the process. Each has her own champion, whose interest is both professional and personal. Tapper Suzy Doolittle is the choice of Bob Dowdy, the production's Boy Friday. Modern ballerina Joanna Moss is the choice of Leo Belney, the musical director. The wild card is Madelyn Corlane - Ted's ex professional and personal partner - who left show business for many of the same reasons Janet left the show. After being away from the business for a few years, Janet, who came in solely as a favor to Jordan, realizes that she is ready to resurrect her musical stage career. The outcome of the process could play a role in what happens in the budding romances. The outcome may also be ultimately dictated by the personal priorities and motivations of the three girls themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While certainly not one of MGM's "classic" musicals, GIVE A GIRL A BREAK has its moments of fun and suspense. Of the three girls auditioning for a role in a musical, which one will land it. The audition itself is quite strange in that each of the three girls just dances a couple of minutes and all three do a different number. Shouldn't they be doing the same one? Also, this is supposed to be a musical revue, yet no one is asked to sing or do a scene. Aside from that, there are many moments of real entertainment, especially be two soon-to-be Broadway choreographers, Bob Fossee and Gower Champion. Debbie Reynolds is in there doing her usual perky singing and dancing to good effect. The unknown Helen Wood, while not very convincing in her acting scenes, is one hell of a dancer. Reminds one of Cyd Charisse, but with a warmer quality. GIVE A GIRL A BREAK is part of the Warner Archive collection with a fairly good disc pressing. For those who enjoy the "old style" musicals with a weakish plot but great musical numbers, this is one to see.</p>
