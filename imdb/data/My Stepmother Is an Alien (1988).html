<h1>My Stepmother Is an Alien (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An alien is sent on a secret mission to Earth, where she appears as a gorgeous, attractive, and single lady. Her mission is to make contact with a rather nerdy young scientist, who's quite overwhelmed by her attentions, and isn't aware of the connection between her arrival and his work.</p>
<p>After a widower scientist accidentally sends a death ray to a planet of super advanced aliens, a femme fatal alien secret agent is sent to Earth to reverse the ray within 48 hours, if her super alien powers and complete lack of understanding human culture don't give her away first.</p>
<p>Widowed astronomer Steven Mills accidentally sends a great surge of energy out into space, threatening life on another world. They respond by dispatching one of their race disguised in deliberately attractive human form (Celeste Martin) to Earth to sort things out, accompanied by a rather less attractive superior (Bag). Steven is indeed attracted, as is his untrustworthy brother, while Celeste becomes increasingly fond of Steven's young daughter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was fun.  I don't know why everyone is ragging on it. Deserving, nerdy guy gets the girl and saves the world. Nice salutes to movies of the '40s. If the plot's weak, it's because there's not much conflict, no diabolical scheming bad guy.  The characters are all sweet and real enough that you care about them. Ms. Basinger is pretty, but if you want to see her do sexy, see _Cool World_.</p>
