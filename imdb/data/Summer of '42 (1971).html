<h1>Summer of '42 (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Silent as a painting, the movie shows us day-dreamer Hermie and his friends Oscy and Benjie spending the summer of '42 on an US island with their parents - rather unaffected by WWII. While Oscy's main worries are the when and how of getting laid, Hermie honestly falls in love with the older Dorothy, who's married to an army pilot. When her husband returns to the front, Hermie shyly approaches her.</p>
<p>Hermie, in middle age, reflects on the summer of 1942 when he was fifteen, the Americans had recently entered fighting in World War II, and he himself was just entering puberty where thoughts of girls were top on his and his friends' minds. He and his two best friends, Oscy and Benjie, and their respective families, spent the summer on an island off the coast of New England, Hermie the sensitive one, Oscy the forward one, and Benjie the meek scared one still closer to being a child than an adult. Although Hermie and Oscy attempted to get as far as second base with girls their own age, they didn't really comprehend the full act of sex, let alone protected sex, only reading about intercourse and seeing the pictures in Benjie's parents' medical book. As they contemplated perhaps trying to go all the way with girls their own age, Hermie could not stop thinking about the young war bride on the island, Dorothy, her husband who was just shipped overseas into combat. Hermie, who did whatever he could to spend time with Dorothy, had no expectations of her in that manner, as he wanted their friendship to be grown-up yet classy and as she only saw him as a nice young man who sometimes helped her with chores she couldn't manage on her own. But an event that happened in her life would change the nature of their friendship, if only for a brief moment in time, out of emotional necessity.</p>
<p>During his summer vacation on Nantucket Island in 1942, a youth eagerly awaiting his first sexual encounter finds himself developing an innocent love for a young woman awaiting news on her soldier husband's fate in WWII.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is truly a wonderful film and a classic. It has everything: romance, comedy, sadness and the reminiscence of puberty and coming of age. The dialog between Hermie and his two teenage buddies wile exploring their emerging sexuality is a wonderful and hilarious, i.e., "Do you think I'm in love with Vera Michaels. I hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her." Who couldn't relate to those things in our youth.Jennifer O'Neill, as Hermie's crush Dorothy, is gorgeous and well suited for her role. The scenes between her and Hermie go from funny and clever to sad and wondrous. One can only guess the emotions going on inside Dorothy's head when she finds out her husband has been killed in the war. I always felt she just wanted to experience closeness with someone during that time and Hermie just happened to be nearby. She also knew he cared about her and it was important for her to be needed . . . by someone.A glorious film and one I can watch tons of times and discover something different each time. Highly recommended.P.S. Michele LeGrand's musical score is beautiful. Just another plus for the movie.</p>
