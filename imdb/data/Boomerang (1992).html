<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marcus is a player who woos and beds women with great ease  but never settles down with any.  When a company merger sees him working for the glamorous Jacqueline, he finds himself being played but still falling for her.  However a relationship with the more stable Angela beckons if he can change his ways  but will Jackie allow him to leave her?Part of the Eddie Murphy come back after the years of Harlem Nights, Golden Child, Another 48 hours, BHC 2 and other weak films.  This and the Distinguished Gentleman saw him try to come back with a fresh approach.  Boomerang is a good film  it uses Murphy's playa persona and turns it on it's head to good effect.  True some of it is plain silly and it is quite predictable but it is pretty enjoyable and quite sexy too!Murphy is good simply because he is the butt of many of the jokes via his playa image  plus it's good to see him be outdone after so many big-headed films.  Givens is very good as the man-eating boss but I found Berry to be too sweet to be believed  but though she was the better looking.  Lawrence and Rock are well used in small roles but Kitt and Grace are pointless and stupid cameos.  Witherspoon is very funny and I personally love to see Lela Rochon in anything (and those aren't her feet).Overall it may not win any awards or being shockingly innovative but it's fun, sexy and has a good bagfull of laughs in there.</p>
