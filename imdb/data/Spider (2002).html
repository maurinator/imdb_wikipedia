<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dennis Clegg is in his thirties and lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in London.

He has never truly recovered, however, and as the story progresses we vicariously experience his increasingly fragile grip on reality.</p>
<p>A mentally disturbed man takes residence in a halfway house. His mind gradually slips back into the realm created by his illness, where he replays a key part of his childhood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this film! The novel that is based on, must have a lot of Freud psyche theories, because the film just reflects it. And in such a perfect manner. Cronenberg has reached a point where he has got a mature talent.It is a brilliant exploration of the Unconscious, of The Edipus Complex, and of Guilt. Cronenberg does for The Edipus Complex here, what Lynch did for The Nightmare in "Mullholland Dr." We really get into Gleg "Spider"'s mind. And it's very terrifying and disturbing inside. Not pretty at all.The cast did an outstanding job. All my praises should go to Fiennes, and especially to Miranda Richardson who plays three different characters with a master talent. She's living prove that there's no justice at the Oscars.If you study psychiatry or psychology go and see it! It's a must see. If you love cinema, go and see it also. One of the year's best.</p>
