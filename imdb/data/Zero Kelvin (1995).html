<h1>Zero Kelvin (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Larsen, an aspiring poet in 20's Oslo, leaves his girlfriend to spend a year as a trapper in East Greenland. There he is teamed with a seemingly rough old sailor/trapper, Randbek, and a scientist, Holm. Trapped in a tiny hut together as the arctic winter sets in, a complex and intense love/hate relationship develops between Randbek and Larsen, who are more similar than either would like to admit. A powerful psychological and physical drama set against stunningly bleak arctic scenery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although that's not a bad thing, that is not exactly what the Kino Video release implies about the film. I was expecting some sort of exciting Arctic adventure story. Something fairly simple-minded, in other words.Since expectation and actualization in this case are as different as snow and ice, it's a little difficult to assess the film fairly.Suffice it to say that Stellan Skarsg√•rd is unrecognizable as the foul-mouthed hunter. In Scandinavia, is he well known for his versatility? If he's not, he should be. Stellan is lousy in this film. I mean that literally. He's infested with lice. He's grubby. You would not want to be locked all winter in a claustrophobic room with him. His character is the heart of this drama.This may not have been the Arctic adventure I was hoping for, but then it didn't leave me cold either.The film was shot on the island of Spitzbergen (Svalbard in Norwegian), but I couldn't tell that I wasn't looking at Greenland.The last credited performer, Tinkas Qorfiq, played the part of Jane, the dog, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
