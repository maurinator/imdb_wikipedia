<h1>St. Louis Blues (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Will Handy grows up in Memphis with his preacher father and his Aunt Hagar. His father intends for him to use his musical gifts only in church, but he can't stay away from the music of the streets and workers. After he writes a theme song for a local politician, Gogo, a speakeasy singer, convinces Will to be her accompanist. Will is estranged from his father for many years while he writes and publishes many blues songs. At last the family is reunited when Gogo brings them to New York to see Will's music played by a symphony orchestra.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A terrific cast, which depicted Southern Black religious traditions and values versus changing times for true opportunity (in the early days). It's a heartfelt movie suitable for the entire family, and should be a suggested viewing in school (if not already).</p>
