<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film barely if ever turns up on TV. It has never been given a DVD release, but it was released on Key Video in 1984 on VHS. David Niven and Art Carney are great to see in this film. Lionel Jeffries is quit funny as Hargreves the somewhat absent minded attorney. Maggie Smith turns in a nice performance as the governess. The film was directed by Bryan Forbes, who made such wonderful films in the 1960's like the Wrong Box, and the L shaped Room. The film was produced by David Niven Jr. I remember seeing David Niven on the Merv Griffen Show talking about working with his son as producer. The photography of Niece is absolutely beautiful. I hope to see this film get the DVD release it deserves. ****</p>
