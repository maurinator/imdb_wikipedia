<h1>Trail of the Pink Panther (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Pink Panther diamond is stolen once again from Lugash and the authorities call in Chief Inspector Clouseau from France. His plane disappears en-route. This time, famous French TV reporter Marie Jouvet sets out to solve the mystery and starts to interview everybody connected to Clouseau. Each interviewee Dreyfus, Sir Charles & Lady Lytton (an ex-wife of Clouseau), George Lytton, Hercule Lajoy (assistant in "A Shot In The Dark"), and Cato tell of their run-ins with Clouseau. She is also kidnapped by mobster Bruno Langlois who doesn't want Clouseau found but she continues and finds Clouseau Sr., Clouseau's father. Is Clouseau alive or is he dead? Each interview has not-yet-seen or famous clips from the previous movies (since Peter Sellers has sadly passed away) as Marie continues to get a honest view or impression of the great French detective...</p>
<p>Inspector Clouseau mysteriously disappears and a journalist attempts to uncover the mystery. New scenes are interspersed with old footage of Peter Sellers from the previous films.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some might call this movie a felonious grave robbery but I think this is a fine tribute to a late comedian master. I don't think it was such a bad idea to take some unused scenes and older highlights and put together a completely new film after decease of masterful Peter Sellers.Even though sequences with Jacques Clouseau don't fit the plot perfectly, it works. There are couple of brilliantly hilarious never-seen-before scenes with Sellers in here and to me that's a reason enough to make this film, I'm sure. I also have to admit Richard Mulligan is superb in the role of Clouseau's father. Bit strange sequel but cool stuff and great fun.</p>
