<h1>The Letter (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Saunders rankles his squad members by showing too much concern for a young replacement who bears a disquieting resemblance to the Sergeant's recently-enlisted kid brother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Letter is a story about Sergeant Saunders living heavy action at the front vicariously through a letter he received from his younger brother. Private Jim Hummel (excellently played by Randy Boone) becomes the Sarge's younger brother.Shirl Hendryx wrote a great screenplay telling a duel story of Saunders' internal fraternal struggle and Private Jim Hummel's drive for acceptance. There's excellent character development amongst the entire squad. The backdrop is terrific combat - 3 great sequences graphically portrayed: Kirby's BAR blazing, machine gun fire on both sides - terrific action.Georg Fenady's outstanding directing could not have displayed the action any better. In conjunction with A.D. Flowers special effects, the episode is flawless.The ending sequence makes one understand why a clutz would not survive in combat scenarios; fleetness of foot is everything.Extremely entertaining, "The Letter" seems longer than 50 some odd minutes and will not disappoint the viewing public.</p>
