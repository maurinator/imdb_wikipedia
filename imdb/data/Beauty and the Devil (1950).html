<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is such an excellent movie.  It's worth calling a masterpiece.  I just want to tell everyone I know about it! Gerard Philippe is amazingly handsome.  To lots of people, he might look not only handsome but also smart, sophiscated and sexy and he is as a matter of a fact. Plots, performance, direction, casting, music and background.  These essences of movies are just outstanding. Told by my friends that he was an amazing actor, I understood that they were right after watching this movie.  I felt deeply satisfied by the quality just like I had wonderful meals in the 3-star restaurant.If you want to explore French movies, I will recommend you this one.</p>
