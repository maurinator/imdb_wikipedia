Flavia pursues him to North Africa, dispensing sexual favors to promote her schemes.</p>
<p>An aging Sir Hector Geste takes a young greedy wife who's after his famed Blue Water sapphire but his sons hide the gem and join the French Foreign Legion in North Africa.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had not seen the original Beau Geste, with Gary Cooper in the title role, when I saw this movie. After seeing this movie, including a *hilarious* 'cameo' of Gary Cooper, I watched the original. It only made me appreciate the humor in the Last Remake even more. The Last Remake (were there ever previous remakes?) parodies the story completely, but every other scene makes you laugh. The scene with Gary Cooper would almost certainly not be allowed on TV today due to censorship so you'll have to buy this movie on, ick, VHS to see it. But at a time when new releases are $10+ to see not including popcorn, paying about $20 for a VHS of this movie, and being able to show it to friends and watch it over and over, is worth it. Trust me on this :)."So that's why you talk so slow Big G."</p>
