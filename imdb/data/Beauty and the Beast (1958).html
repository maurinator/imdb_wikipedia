<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hi. Perhaps my opinion can be seen as an exaggeration. But to me all of those films, displayed in those years, when I was just a little girl, were one of the most beautiful presents any channel has been able to give to childhood audience. I am looking forward to finding the way to download or buy all of them to show my children and grandchildren the beauty and magic of them. If you can teach me the way to do that I would really appreciate it a lot. The performance of almost of the actors and actresses, the customs, the ambiance, the vocabulary used by the characters were so well cared that you could feel part of the play. In this specific tale, Charlton Heston's performance was beautiful, tender together with the fear he could get children felt when he was still a beast. Nobody after that, neither TV program producer nor movies ones have taken the challenge of creating the same programs but using the advance of the new technology in computers and it is very sad. Children nowadays deserve to enjoy TV programs like those ones which gave to children from those old years so nice and special moments and then dreams. Thank you a lot for your attention.</p>
