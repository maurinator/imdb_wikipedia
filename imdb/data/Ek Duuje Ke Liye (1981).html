<h1>Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hindi-speaking collegian Sapna lives a wealthy lifestyle in Dona Paula, near Panaji, Goa, India, along with her Professor dad, Kundanlal, and mom. Their immediate neighbors are Tamil-speaking vegetarian tenants, V. Sivaramakrishan, his wife, Vandana and son, Vasudevan, and detest the Kundanlals' meat-eating habits. Both families are aghast with surprise and anger when they find out that Sapna and Vasudevan are in love with each other. Strong opposition only strengthens their romance, forcing the families to compel the couple to stay away for a year, and not to communicate to each other in any manner. Both agree, and Vasudevan leaves for Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, to work for G. Haribabu, a Chartered Accountant. Vasudevan befriends a widow, Sandhya, and learns how to dance as well as read and write Hindi, while his dad arranges his marriage with Tamil-speaking Tulsi. While on a trip to Mangalore he finds out that Sapna has got married to Chakravarty, and instantly decides to propose to Sandhya, who agrees to marry him. Does this signal the end of their romance? What impact will Vasudevan's past have on Sandhya when she eventually finds out about his feelings about Sapna?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The scene is a small town in India before liberalisation and globalisation. In fact, I don't think America or any foreign country is mentioned in the script or any picturisation done there. contrast this with Bollywood of 2000s where the only Indian part is language and actors.The people are simple and the life of young ones are sans complications. If today's Indian youth were not panting after career, America etc., then they would fall in love exactly like this.The story is well executed on screen. There are no contemporary obsessions like morality, or Indian versus American values or saas-bahu conspiracies. Even the numerous plots by girl's mother (Shubha Khote) to separate the lover duo are almost poetic and are received by the lovers as tests of the path of love.The songs and the ending are the highpoint of the film. Rakesh Bedi adds comic relief. This is one of the few films where no villain / negative characters is trying to marry either lover.</p>
