<p>Wonderful Ann-Margret never fails to amaze me. She's just adorable in this movie, and I loved her character Rose. I found the relationship between Rose and Bubber to actually be quite believable. A-M just never does wrong by me. Loved this movie, Love Ann-Margret, It was sweet! Especially the ending!=) ~Tina~</p>
