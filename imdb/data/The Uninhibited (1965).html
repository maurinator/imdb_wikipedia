<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Vincent" (Hardy Krüger), recovering from a nervous breakdown, reaches a village on the Costa Brava for a holiday. Upon arrival, "Regnier" (James Mason), an alcoholic writer, introduced him to the bar regulars "La Estrella", and its owner "Jenny" (Melina Mercouri), an attractive woman that Vincent is immediately smitten. Moreover, the son of Regnier will relate "Serge and Nadine", two teenage lovers, whose story will end tragically.In the early 1960s led Juan Antonio Bardem "Nunca pasa nada" and "Los pianos mecánicos," both with music by Georges Delerue. In "Los pianos mecánicos" we found a sexy and curious soundtrack at the same time, since it gives us to build a dump Delerue score of jazz, which also fit other types of music. The presence of jazz is linked to the plot of the movie, since some of the players will be linked to a nightclub, while the rest of the score includes style themes "Delerue", in which the presence of the rope leaves an important note. The set provides a soundtrack for very nice to hear, with the added value of the influences of jazz and Delerue that work in Spain, with one of the producers of our cinema charismatic as Barden.Not bad cast that movie (James Mason, Melina Mercouri ...) that adapted a novel by Henri-François Rey but treating their existential conflict-loving bohemians in Cadaqués (named in the film as Caldella) do not has enough rhythm for this film.</p>
