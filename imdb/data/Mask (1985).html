<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has moved me since it first came out in the 1980's. Theperformances- particularly by Cher and Eric Stoltz as Rusty and RockyDennis- are fantastic, the camera work (by the great Lazlo Kovacs) fluidand superb, the make up won an academy award, the music perfect, and thestory, well, it's almost too good to be true. It's real life we'rewatching here, and knowing that it's also a true story makes it all themore touching and wonderful. I watched it with my boyfriend, then myhusband, and now with my children. It's a simple tale of triumph of thespirit, but it goes deep and really stays with you if you let it. If youhaven't seen this movie yet, go out and rent it tonight, you won't bedisappointed.......</p>
