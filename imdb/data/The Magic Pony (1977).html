<h1>The Magic Pony (1977)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this movie as a young child when TV was fairly new. The movie was in black and white and the voice track and music were completely different. I am going back at least 50 years so I know this is not the original since Erin Moran, one of the voices was not even born at the time.I have always found this movie enchanting in spite of the new voices but it is not quite as good as the original. I have searched for an original copy but apparently it is no longer available. If you have young children, this is a must for your library of tapes. The animation is exceptional, the story line is a classic and children still seem to enjoy it very much as do adults.</p>
