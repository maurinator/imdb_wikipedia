<h1>Rocketship X-M (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Astronauts (Lloyd Bridges, Osa Massen, John Emery, Noah Beery, Jr., and Hugh O'Brien) blast off to explore the moon. Because of craft malfunction and some fuel calculations, they end up landing on Mars. On Mars, evidence of a once powerful civilization is found. The scientists determine that an atomic war destroyed most of the Martians (who surprisingly look like humans). Those that survived reverted to a caveman-like existence.</p>
<p>An astronaut crew on their way to the Moon are unexpectedly propelled by gravitational forces and end up on Mars instead.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some films are blessed (though the producers would  argue) by having less money with which to work.   "Rocketship X-M" (the initials represent "eXpedition  Moon") relies therefore upon, ahem, a real Story,  with Acting, rather than flash and effects.  That's  why a half-century later, the well-remembered "RX-M"  has held up so well.  (An analogy could be drawn  with the co-incidental 1949-1955 television series  "Captain Video and His Video Rangers", where the  bulk of budget also went towards quality writers and  cast.)  John Emery is - surprise!- a good guy here.  Osa Massen, one of the screen's most photogenic  stars ever, is radiant.  The whole cast carries  through the forgivable inconsistencies with style.   Ferde Grofé's music takes us from exultant triumph  to eerie mystery and, finally, into bitter  realization of what the RX-M crew discovers, the   utter waste of an entire civilization.  (Remember the real-life "face" on Mars?)  Grofé  well-illustrates the withering madness in the crew's  panicked escape and return attempt.  And the final  moments aboard the doomed RX-M are of the stuff that  makes for great film.  I saw this in theatrical  release, and you, too, will find "Rocketship X-M"  one of your most memorable.  Highly recommended to  all.</p>
