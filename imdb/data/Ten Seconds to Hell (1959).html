<h1>Ten Seconds to Hell (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At the end of the Second World War six German ex-soldiers return to Berlin and set up as a bomb disposal group. The pressure of the dangerous work starts to affect them, the more so as they have agreed to pool half their pay so that if only one survives he takes it all. Casualties and friction are inevitable, and having to handle British 1000lb bombs seems particularly bad news.</p>
<p>Shotly after Germany's defeat in World War II, Karl Wirtz (Jeff Chandler) and Eric Koertner (Jack Palance), and three cronies return to a bombed-out Berlin from a prisoner-of-war camp. Being demolition experts, they accept the dangerous but high paying job of defusing many of the still-unexploded Allied bombs throughout the city. At the suggestion of Wirtz, each man is to pay half of his earnings into a joint fund- If a man dies in the course of the job, his share is to be divided among the others---until the last men or man (if any)alive at the end of six months collects the residue of this macabre "estate." Nearing the end of their job, only Wirtz and Koertner are still alive...and both are in love with Margot Hoefer (Martine Carol). This situation does not bode well for somebody.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this in a colorized version (shudder, I know!), but I guess it's better than nothing!! This is yet another war-themed film for Aldrich but a novel one, dealing with a six-man bomb-disposal unit in Germany after the end of World War II.As such, it's much closer in spirit to the stark (and often hysterical) ATTACK! (1956) than the sweeping blockbusters - THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967) and TOO LATE THE HRO (1970; see review above) - of the next decade. Indeed, here, Jack Palance is again given a sympathetic role - while Jeff Chandler, uncharacteristically, essays the villainous type. Interestingly, the film was made by Britain's House of Horror - Hammer Films (in association with United Artists) - with shooting taking place at Germany's celebrated UFA studios! Plot-wise, however, the film is somewhat contrived: Palance and Chandler hate each other's guts but still lodge together and, of course, fall for their attractive - and lonely - French landlady (Martine Carol); by the end, only they have survived their dangerous line of work and the two face-off in a literally explosive climax! While no classic, it's professionally handled and has undeniable moments of power (one of the deaths is filmed in a way that we never see the man's face but, when the remaining members of the group are reconvened, we realize that Wesley Addy is missing; Chandler's story about his uncle teaching him to always look out for himself first and how the latter was the first to suffer for it).</p>
