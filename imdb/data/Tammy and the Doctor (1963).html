<h1>Tammy and the Doctor (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Mrs. Call's heart condition acts up, Tammy tags along in the trip to Los Angeles when the old lady is getting her surgery. Since there are no guest quarters in the hospital, Tammy gets a job in the hospital as a nurse's assistant. Peter Fonda plays Tammy's love interest, Dr. Mark Cheswick, while Adam West has a small part as Dr. Eric Hassler. This is the final entry in the canonic film series, and Sandra Dee's last appearance as Tammy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a young teen, I watched all of the " Tammy " movies that came on TV. It did not matter if the part was being played by Sandra Dee or Debbie Reynolds. I just couldn't wait to see what Tammy had to say next or how she was going to say it, to see the reaction on other faces and how they take it. I could really relate to this movie being from Alabama. I understood some of the sayings from her grandfather that the people in the movie didn't. I dreamed of being on a river boat having the adventures that Tammy had and I would sit with Tammy and listen to her stories. Sandra Dee is captivating, a wonderful actress, plays a loving friend role and is just so funny especially when she is trying to be so serious. I think everyone should see it, especially those in the medical profession.</p>
