<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1981 film is supported by a great cast and film score.  The careers of Rubinek, Cattrall and Mancuso were boosted by this excellent film.  An anti-cult film, "Ticket To Heaven" (1981) shares a similar subject with "Split Image," released the following year.  TTH, for me, is a much more entertaining and realistic film.  Filled with dramatic moments and fine performances, it deals with the true story of a depressed young man drifting into the cult of Sun-Yung Moon. "Split Image" (1982) portrays the identity crisis of a young man seeking answers beyond the illusions of his own shallow life and those of his family and friends.  His search leads him to a new-age cult, where he finds the leader and his goals to be more sinister and empty than the life he ran away from.  Carried by the cast and a fine music score by Bill Conti, "Split Image" doesn't provide the realistic, powerful performances from the lead characters that make TTH the choice between the two.  Both films communicate worthy messages and deserve a look. While many of life's questions can be answered by the Bible, proper spiritual guidance and direction is essential, particularly for those who are not mature enough to seek God on their own.  At the time these films were released, cults were very active and predatory.  Today's youth are more likely to drift into new-age or satanic cults than Christian ones or, perhaps more likely, choose a life that is without spiritual goals or substance.  Both these films can help by providing some answers or by stimulating thought on subjects that might otherwise be avoided.</p>
