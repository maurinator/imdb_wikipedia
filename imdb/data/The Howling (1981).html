<h1>The Howling (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a red light district, newswoman Karen White is bugged by the police, investigating serial killer Eddie Quist, who has been molesting her through phone calls. After police officers find them in a peep-show cabin and shoot Eddie, Karen becomes emotionally disturbed and loses her memory. Hoping to conquer her inner demons, she heads for the Colony, a secluded retreat where the creepy residents are rather too eager to make her feel at home. There also seems to be a bizarre connection between Eddie Quist and this supposedly safe haven. And when, after nights of being tormented by unearthly cries, Karen ventures into the forest and makes a terrifying discovery.</p>
<p>Serial killer Eddie Quist has been preying on the homeless, and Karen White is the only newswoman he communicates with. After a near fatal encounter with him at an adult video store, she is ordered by Dr. George Waggner to take a vacation. Eddie was killed by police officers, but Karen's role in capturing him had been quite traumatic and she can't picture his face. She discovers that he came from a small community in the woods where she decides to vacation with her husband Bill Neill. What she does not realize is that Eddie was from a pack of werewolves who are trying to keep a low profile and does not want any interviews. Now she must not only fight for her life... but for her very soul.</p>
<p>After a bizarre and near fatal encounter with a serial killer, a television newswoman is sent to a remote mountain resort whose residents may not be what they seem.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes! For a change in the horror genre this film does deserve all of the praise, hype, cult following and respect it receives, even from the critics. I would go so far as to even admit that I find this Joe (Gremlins, Innerspace, The 'burbs, Matinee, Small soldiers) Dante flick one of his best crafted works, followed by PIRANHA.It's always been a toss up between THE HOWLING and AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON for the most effective lycanthropy picture of postmodern horror cinema (anything since Psycho). Where John Landis used comedy more blatantly, the humour in THE HOWLING is far more satirical and subversive. Undoubtedly, Rob Bottin's  effects steal the show as well as they did for John Carpenter's THE THING. The transformation of Eddie Quist, especially on the revamped DVD is something to behold.For anyone with a passing interest in the horror genre this is a film to include on that 'TO SEE' list. For fans of werewolf movies this should go on that 'MUST SEE' list.</p>
