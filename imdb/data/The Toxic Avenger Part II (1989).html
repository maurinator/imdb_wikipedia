<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Toxic Avenger II i(1989) is the sequel to The Toxic Avenger. Troma received funding from a Japanese investor to help make a sequel about a superhero from New Jersey. After all the filming was completed, Lloyd Kaufman ended up with a three hour picture. Figuring out that you can make two dollars instead of one, Kaufman edited the film into two different movies. The results being Toxic Avenger II and III. The Toxic Avenger II is campier and cheesier than the first film (if that was even possible)and it has more of a comic book feel. With no more evil left to combat, Melvin is bored with his mundane life. Because of his toxic condition job opportunities are very limited. That's until the evil corporation Apocalypse Inc. moves into Melvin's hometown of Tromaville. Adding to Melvin's personal conflicts, word has it that his father is alive and residing in Japan. What happens next has to be seen.Highly recommended for Cult film fans!</p>
