<h1>The Money Pit (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Walter Fielding and Anna Crowley have to start looking for a new house- but there's not much they can afford! This soon changes when they meet a lonely old con artist who sells them a beautiful mansion at a ridiculously low price. Only there's a catch. The second they move into the house it falls apart, starting with the stairway collapsing to the bathtub falling through the floor to eventually the chimney falling into the house! Finally, they have to renovate the house before the frame collapses but the renovations also prove to be a disaster.</p>
<p>Walter and Anna want a home of their own. When Walter's real estate agent friend offers him what looks like the perfect home, Anna and Walter buy it. The house has many problems; structural, plumbing, electrical... These problems only come to light after they've moved in. Hence, the house is a 'money pit'. Also worthy of note are the comical builders and the terrible ex husband, Max, who still chases Anna.</p>
<p>A young couple sinks their life savings into a house that is falling apart to the extent that it no longer has a main stairway or water. This creates strains on their relationship. Every home owner will recognize some of the situations they encounter.</p>
<p>A young couple struggles to repair a hopelessly dilapidated house.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another film, I love from 86, sees Hanks, again impressing us, with great comic timing, and soon to be wife, Shelly Long (always good in any role) buy the lemon from hell. There are laughs here and there, but the fun is in just watching this place come apart and crumble. Not sounding morbid or dastardly here. Here, anything and everything comes apart, you have to ask yourself, "How the hell did they stage all of the faults". It must of taken hours. Some of the defects are bloody dangerous to watch, mostly concerning wires blowing apart and power outlets. Poor Hanks getting sucked in through a hole in the second story floor, was one of the fun moments. No other actor could fit this role, and I wouldn't want to see any other actor in this role. Joe Mantegna as a randy carpenter who makes the moves on Long, I liked. Shelly's ex-Alexander Gordonuv provided a likable character of flair, despite being shallow, and narcissistic. After not seeing this film in a very long time, I still enjoyed it today as I did then. By the way, in the house is amazingly, revamped, where in the end, for first home buyers, hope is possible. Lets face it, at the start, this crumbling house made the one in Emoh Ruo, look like a dream, it's faults, coming in small pittance.</p>
