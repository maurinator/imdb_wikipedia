<h1>Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry Bannerman, a Connecticut suburbanite who becomes involved in various shenanigans with his wife Grace Oglethorpe, leads a protest movement against a secret army plan to set up a missile base in their community.</p>
<p>The Bannermans and Hoffas are neighbors in suburban Putnam's Landing, located fifty miles north of New York City on the shores of Long Island Sound. Harry Bannerman, who owns his own PR firm, loves his wife Grace Bannerman and their two young children, Peter and Danny Bannerman, despite Grace spending most of her time volunteering to lead one community project after another resulting in Harry feeling somewhat neglected and romance having largely left their marriage due solely to lack of time. Conversely, Angela Hoffa being neglected by her businessman husband Oscar Hoffa results in Angela coming to the conclusion that she doesn't love him, she who sets her sights on the next closest man, namely Harry. From this point, the Bannermans' life takes a downward turn starting with announcement that the army has purchased property in the community to conduct a top secret project. Grace gladly accepts the appointment as head of the team that will try and stop the army from conducting this project in their community - at least until the army discloses the nature of the project - she appointing Harry, using his PR skills, to be chief liaison with the army. The officer heading the secret project is Captain Hoxie, a man with as much tact and finesse as a bull in a china shop. These actions set off a series of incidents leading to Grace believing that Harry is having an affair with Angela. While Harry deals with the army and tries to fend off Angela, he has to show Grace in a meaningful way that he really does love her and that there is nothing going on between him and Angela, he deciding to use Grace's annual pet project of the very public fourth of July pageant to achieve everything he wants. But as they say about best laid plans...</p>
<p>All about the citizens of Putnam's Landing and their reactions to an army missile base in their back yard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You've gotta feel sorry for Harry (Paul Newman) in "Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!". His wife (Joanne Woodward) is ALWAYS busy with committees and projects and never has time for him. No sooner does he convince her to take out some time so they can go off to a romantic hotel than she agrees to head up yet another committee--one to fight a new army base coming to town! This time, she not only agrees to be the head but volunteers Harry for it as well! All Harry wants is to be with his wife....alone! At the same time, a VERY sexy neighbor (Joan Collins) is suffering from the same problem with her husband--a man who is practically never home. However, she deals with it very differently--she decides she wants Harry! And, she'll do ANYTHING to get him--even ruin his marriage. For a 1950s film, "Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!" is an amazingly sexual film. Think about it--the premise is that Harry is very sexually frustrated through no fault of his own! And, again and again, his libido is unfulfilled.So is this little comedy worth seeing? Yes. However, just because it has Newman and Woodward does NOT mean it's a great film--which it isn't. The film suffers from two main problems--the unfulfilled libido and the marital problems in Harry's marriage do seem to go on a bit too long. Additionally, I found it difficult to enjoy at times because Woodward's character is really difficult to like. Plus, towards the end it all just degenerates into a bit of a mess. Still, it's a cute film and a decent way to spend 106 minutes of your life provided your expectations are not especially high.By the way, the pageant about Pocahontas was perhaps even more insanely inaccurate than the Disney film. Imagine--Pocahontas greeting the Pilgrims lead by John Smith at Plymouth!! Firecrackers! Crazy.</p>
