<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Oscar-nominated Israeli film tackles the awakening of a teenager as he becomes acquainted with the turbulent socio-political era in Israel.  Mizrahi regular Michal Bat-Adam convincingly plays the destitute mother who struggles to make her family earn a living by washing clothes, though problem arises when his eldest son falls in love with a librarian while being influenced with the unstable condition in the land.  At times, the proceedings look like a daily TV soap opera, as obvious with the camerawork and the over-the-top performances.  But the ending justifies the theme that it wants to explore.  A deserved viewing, if you can find one in your video shop.</p>
