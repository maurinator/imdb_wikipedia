<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>GOOD - Simply an enjoyable movie; lots of fun to watch and highlighted by a humorous Basketball game. Also, the surround sound is very good, the colors are beautiful, the cartoon effects well done and funny. Some of the humor is laugh-out-loud variety. As with a many good animated movies, there is so much to see and hear it would take many viewings to catch all the gags. With each viewing, you'll laugh at things you never noticed before. As far as "live" actors working with cartoon figures, this was much better done than the earlier "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," so progress has been made in that area. While there is a lot going on, there are enough lulls to give viewers periodic breaks. The basketball action is fun to watch and I was surprised how well real-life stars Larry Bird and Michael Jordan acted.BAD - The story gets a little too juvenile in spots. The PC-minded female character (rabbit) is overly feminist, to the point of irritation and the occult gets far too much credibility in this story. Also, there are a few sexual innuendos in here that adults would catch but, hopefully, not little kids.OVERALL, a movie that appeals to adults and kids. Basketball fans will really enjoy it.</p>
