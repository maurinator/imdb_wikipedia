<h1>She Couldn't Say No (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As usual with most of the RKO films from this era "presented" by RKO-owner Howard Hughes, the PCA number is usually 500-1000 digits lower than the one from other studios being released at the time, indicating it was released a year or more after it was completed. This one finds heiress Corby Lane (Jean Simmons) coming to a small Arkansas town to play Santa Claus because, when she was a small child traveling with her impoverished father, the townspeople saved her life by donating money needed for medical treatment. She meets and falls in love with "Doc" Sellers (Robert Mitchum), an easy-going doctor who enjoys fishing and the unhurried pace of the town. Corby's gesture of handing out money and lavish gifts to the citizens backfires when, after it has been publicized, the town becomes the destination of every wayward traveler and fortune seeker.</p>
<p>A wealthy heiress returns to a small Arkansas town to furtively reward the townsfolk who helped to save her life when she was a young girl.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those movies that is improbable but fun, with one of the most important features (in my opinion) for a movie - it is entertaining.Bob's pairing with Jean Simmons is almost as good as his pairing with Deborah Kerr, although the chemistry is different; perhaps more paternal on his part.I am, admittedly, a big Mitchum fan, but I won't buy a movie just because he is in it.  The other actors in this film do a fine job and help give it a little more substance than the plot would have otherwise.If this ever comes out on dvd, I'm buying it!</p>
