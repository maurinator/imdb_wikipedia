<h1>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a tale that almost redefines sibling rivalry, faded actresses Blanche and 'Baby' Jane Hudson live together. Jane was by far the most famous when she performed with their father in vaudeville but as they got older, it was Blanche who became the finer actress, which Jane still resents. Blanche is now confined to a wheelchair and Jane is firmly in control. As time goes by, Jane exercises greater and greater control over her sister, intercepting her letters and ensuring that few if anyone from the outside has any contact with her. As Jane slowly loses her mind, she torments her sister going to ever greater extremes.</p>
<p>In 1917, Baby Jane is a famous, but spoiled child star that performs a show with her father under the jealous look of her sister Blanche. In 1935, Blanche Hudson becomes a famous and glamorous actress in Hollywood and the untalented Baby Jane Hudson only acts because Blanche forces the producers to give parts to her. One night, they go to a party and there is a car accident. In 1962, Blanche is a crippled woman that has been left wheelchair-bound after the accident that lives with her alcoholic sister Baby Jane in a decaying Hollywood mansion. Baby Jane does not recall the accident since she was drunk and is in absolute control over Blanche that is completely isolated without any contact with the outside world and dumping her correspondence in the trash. As Baby Jane becomes more insane, she decides to return to the stage and hires the idle Edwin Flagg to play piano. Meanwhile she continues to torment Blanche and her cruelty increases.</p>
<p>Elderly sisters Blanche Hudson and Jane Hudson, who now live together in a house owned by Blanche, have each had their brush with fame. As a child, Jane, better known as Baby Jane, was a spoiled vaudeville star, doted on by their manager father to the exclusion of timid Blanche, who was hidden behind the scenes. As young adults, Blanche became a movie star, and used her fame and power at the studio to get Jane movie roles, much to the studio's chagrin, they who felt Jane more a liability than asset. Blanche's stardom continued until her "accident" which has left her wheelchair-bound and now largely dependent upon Jane for the most basic of needs. Blanche is enjoying a resurgence in popularity with her old movies being shown on television, which irks A-type Jane, whose celebrity is largely forgotten. As such, an angry Jane is in the process of trying to reestablish her career by resurrecting her Baby Jane act. To take Blanche down another notch, Jane also uses total control and other forms of psychological torture to torment Blanche, who feels largely helpless as she can't get messages out of the house or receive incoming messages without Jane knowing or approving. Blanche believes Jane is emotionally disturbed and wants to drive her crazy, or worse kill her. The truth behind some long standing Hollywood gossip may be the tipping point in resolving the battle between the sisters, but not before some collateral damage.</p>
<p>Two aging sisters, Blanche and Jane, share a large house. Jane was once a child star and Blanche was, in adult life, a star of the silver screen. Blanche's career ended when she was left paralysed from the waist down in an accident involving Jane. Now Jane looks after Blanche in the house, though not very well. Filled with bitterness at her own cinematic career never taking off, envious of Blanche's career and money, an alcoholic and a touch deranged, Jane goes out of her way to torment her sister.</p>
<p>Two aging film actresses live as virtual recluses in an old Hollywood mansion. Jane Hudson, a successful child star, cares for her crippled sister Blanche, who's career in later years eclipsed that of Jane. Now the two live together, their relationship affected by simmering subconscious thoughts of mutual envy, hate and revenge.</p>
<p>A former child star torments her paraplegic sister in their decaying Hollywood mansion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently viewed this film with a friend who had never seen it before.  Much to my surprise, we had to turn it off early because this friend actually found Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? boring.    I'll admit that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a dated piece of work.  By today's standards, there is no shock value.  The actresses are not well known by the younger crowds out there.  There is a lot of dialogue and very little action. It simply doesn't fit in with today's expectations of horror and suspense.  So why does it hold up as a great film, at least by my standards and by the standards of so many others?To truly appreciate this film, it would be necessary to understand the background.  What actually contributed to the making of this film is what I find truly fascinating.  The story itself is about two elderly sisters.  One, Baby Jane, (played by Bette Davis) was a child star in the early part of the century.  She was hugely popular on the vaudeville circuit. Backstage she was a spoiled brat.  Later on in life the other sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) became a popular Hollywood movie star, overshadowing her now 'has-been' sister.  A supposed car accident leaves Blanche crippled during the height of her popularity and a crazed Jane is left to care for her.In their later life Blanche is confined to her bedroom and Jane, still donning the make up and curls from her childhood runs the house.  Jane still believes she can resurect her career, but is tormented by her sisters continued popularity as her films are rerun on television.There are some fabulous lines throughout the movie that have become legendary.  Blanche says, "You couldn't do this to me if I wasn't in this wheel chair.'  Jane quips "But ya are Blanche, but ya are."Davis plays Jane to the hilt, looking hysterically eerie as she tortures Crawford's stoic Blanche.  My kid sister saw this film after seeing Mommie Dearest and aptly stated that this was just dessert for a woman who beat her children so badly.  I think my sister was most impressed when Davis kicks Joan in the stomach.  "Take that Mommie Dearest!"Back to my original point, I believe that in order to truly appreciate this story, one must appreciate the behind-the-scenes legend that truly is the essence of this film.  Davis and Crawford were, and are, two of the most formidable actresses in Hollywood.  Between them there are hundreds of films, three Oscars, and countless tidbits of gossip.  Both had to claw and chew their way to the top, and had to fight harder to stay there.  They both had stormy relationships, and bitter feuds with studio bosses and directors.  And both have a legion of fans that have survived long after they did.  And of course, lets not forget the fact that they may have despised each other. There is a fantastic book called Bette and Joan (I can't recall the author's name) that I recommend any novice viewer read prior to viewing this film.  In it, the lives of these two remarkable women are described in gossipy detail.  A lot of time is spent detailing the making of this film. At the time Joan was pushing her husbands company, Pepsi.  It was rumored, perhaps by Bette that her Pepsi bottles were half filled with vodka.  Bette also complains vehemently about the size of Joan's fake cleavage, and how they got in the way of some of those scenes.  It's even suggested that some of those beatings that Joan took from Bette were real.  With all of this background, one might soon appreciate, as I did, the importance of this film in documenting the lives of these two prominent women.  I don't think we'll ever come so close to true Hollywood Babylon as we will with this brilliant work.</p>
