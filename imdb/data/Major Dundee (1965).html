<h1>Major Dundee (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the last winter of the Civil War, cavalry officer Amos Dundee leads a contentious troop of Army regulars, Confederate prisoners and scouts on an expedition into Mexico to destroy a band of Apaches who have been raiding U.S. bases in Texas.</p>
<p>In 1864 Major Amos Dundee leads his troops into Mexico after a group of renegade Apache Indians, led by Sierra Chariba. On a recent raid, they kidnapped some young boys and Dundee is committed to retrieving them. His own Union troops are supplemented by Confederate prisoners of war. Led by Lt. Benjamin Tyree - he and Dundee were once friends - he gives his word that he will follow Dundee's orders until Chariba is caught. Over the course of several months, Dundee and his men not only have to fight the Apaches but also French troops. As the mission continues, tensions rise between the Union and Confederate troops leading to a final confrontation with their foe.</p>
<p>In 1864, due to frequent Apache raids from Mexico into the US, a Union officer decides to illegally cross the border and destroy the Apache, using a mixed army of Union troops, Confederate POWs, civilian mercenaries and scouts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why isn't there a "director's cut" of this movie in DVD format?  It's editing caused Sam to disown the finished cut.  During production Charleton Heston charged Sam on horseback with saber drawn, quick boomwork averted disaster. He also offered to forgo his salary to get it released. What an inigma.  My appreciation is for the accurate depiction of historical details.  Horse Cavalry at it's best even to bugle calls.  Pre-revisionist accurate depiction of Apache depredations.  Maximillian's French vs. Jauristas is also depicted without apology.  The whole pathos of Confederate P.O.W.s who galvanized Yankee to serve on the frontier.  Good drama with lots of action to keep the story rolling.  "Bring it on..." history "in your face". Please, please, please give us a Directors cut DVD. Hollywood are you listening to middle America? JAmes Coburn's cameo as one armed scout is worth the watch alone.</p>
