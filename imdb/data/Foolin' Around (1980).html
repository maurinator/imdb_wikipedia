<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A working-class boy falls for a girl from a wealthy family, and must compete for her with a rich boy who also wants her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie, but I love the songs from Seals and Croft more. I have searched everywhere to find the music with no luck. Please if anyone has any information about how to find the soundtrack I would greatly appreciate it. Gary Busey is wonderful, and the physical comedy by Randal and leechman is amazing. They should definitely put this movie and many more on DVD for further generations to see. I grew up watching the movie just to here the song by S&C during the opening credits and during the love scene by the lake in the van with Gary busey and Annette o'toole. For a good laugh and a sweet ending this is a must see. and it is a shame that it was never given the credit it deserves or the play time and attention.</p>
