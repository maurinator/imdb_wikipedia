<h1>Cry Danger (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rocky Mulloy, back in town after serving 5 years of a life sentence for armed robbery, hopes to clear his friend Danny Morgan who's still in prison for the same crime. It won't be easy. Even the witness who cleared Rocky thinks he's guilty; Danny's glamorous wife Nancy, living in a sleazy trailer court, seems lukewarm about getting Danny back; cynical cop Gus Cobb just wants to stir things up in hopes that the missing "hot" $100,000 will surface. Plenty of tough talk, night scenes, deceptive dames and double crosses in this typical film noir.</p>
<p>"Rocky" Mulloy is framed for a murder and a holdup he didn't commit and pulls a five year stretch in prison. He is finally pardoned when a friend returns from overseas to corroborate his testimony in court. "Rocky" then goes hunting for the real culprits so this his prison buddy, believed to be innocent, can also be pardoned. Nancy Morgan, wife of his friend, falls in love with him along the way, and he also has a few bullets fired at him by an oily character. "Rocky" finds the guilty party in a place he didn't think about looking.</p>
<p>Ex-con Rocky Mulloy seeks the real culprit in the crime he was framed for, in a night world of deceptive dames and double crosses.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good dialog and a fast-moving story make this one of the better somewhat-unknown film noirs of its day.Dick Powell and Jay Adler wisecrack their way through this film with some humorous sarcasm. Both are a lot of fun to watch. Powell was in his prime for this kind of role. He was much more mature looking than in his earlier musical days and he fits the part of a tough detective to a tee. His dialog with the tough cop, played by Regis Toomey, also is excellent stuff.Jean Porter provides added humor with her supporting role as the bimbo-thief date for Adler and Rhonda Fleming adds beauty. A younger William Conrad - with a dark head of hair and a mustache - also has a key role in here.Even though it is classified as film noir, I'm not sure it belongs in that category because it doesn't feature the brooding, dark type of characters and atmosphere one usually sees in that genre. One place is does belong is in your collection, if you like classic crime stories. This is another attractive film that still hasn't been issued on DVD.</p>
