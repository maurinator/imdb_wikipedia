<h1>Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Urban Legends: The Final Cut follows Amy Mayfield (Morrison), a student at Alpine University who struggles to complete her thesis film on urban legends - only to have her crew members fall prey to fatal 'accidents.' Suspicious, Amy investigates and discovers a much more sinister hand at work. Now she must unmask the killer before she, too, becomes an urban legend.</p>
<p>Studying at Alpine University, Amy Mayfield seeks help, especially from the late Travis Stark's twin brother Trevor Stark. She needs help to complete her thesis on Pendleton's 'urban legends' theme for Professor Solomon's film class. After the volunteers fall victim one by one to new urban legend-copycat-killings, both desperately dig for the truth to save themselves and hopefully their friends, all suspect as well as staff.</p>
<p>A film school is the center of a fresh spate of killings based on urban legends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Music composer John Ottman and editor for Bryan Singer films, tries his hand at directing and does a reasonable job with this entertaining derivative meta slasher. The slashings and goings on take place at the most prestigious and unrealistic film school imaginable and a fencing masked killer is wiping out one film student after another. The whole film is exceptionally dumb and doesn't really have anything to do with urban legends, with the exception of a tacked on waking up in a bathtub missing a kidney scene, but Jennifer Morrison is cute and does a good job with this material. None of the deaths are memorable, but the film has a cheesy playful side that knows it's B material and Ottman runs with it.</p>
