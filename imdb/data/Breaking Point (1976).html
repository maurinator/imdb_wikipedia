<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bo Svenson witness a beating, which turned into a murder and now he is in the witness protection program headed by Robert Culp. He was "tricked" into testify against John Colicos's oganization, which backfires when the system fails and now Colicos wants Svenson dead.  Good action at times, sloppy editing (one scene we have Svenson leaving, then quickly cuts to a middle of a car chase), cheap but a early (for its time) electronic syntherizer music, and the film has that slow Canadian 70's film feel to it that sort of put you to sleep. Supporting cast like Stephen Young or even Culp has little to do, and minus one sort of rape scene with nudity, and some foul language, the film is easy to cut for T.V, as the violence is rather mild.  This movie actually opened wide for 20th century fox, but is not on video (except Canada), but seems to be a cable classic recently.  Being a Svenson fan, it's great to see the film again, but something tells me the film was originally longer. I think its Svensons BEST non "Walking Tall" film, and Svenson does pick up a Bufford Pusser 2x4 wood as he hits one of the bad guy behind the tent in the last 10 minutes. Recommened to 70's action fans. And for a panavision film, the director didnt utilize the format well, as practically every shot is kept in the middle, as to not lose any image when viewed on TV!!</p>
