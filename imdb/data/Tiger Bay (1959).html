<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie on television as a child.  After almost 40 years, it still stays in my mind, and I can, even now, remember certain scenes, especially the ending.  To me, this is what movies are all about.  I don't own a DVD player and, unfortunately, this movie seems to be available only on DVD. Ah well, I suppose I'll have to buy a DVD player soon.  Give yourself a rare treat and watch this movie.  I guarantee you'll be moved.  You may even find yourself with a tear in your eye.</p>
