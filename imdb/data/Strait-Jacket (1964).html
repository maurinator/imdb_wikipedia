<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For die-hard Crawford fan's this movie is an absolute hoot!!!! To see our gal Joanie decked out in the horrible wig with bangs to the jangling bracelets, it's a camp classic. Joan plays a woman who catches her young husband in bed with another hoochie and murders them both with an AXE and is sent to the loony bin for a number of years. The fun starts when she is released and guess what, you got it, axe murders start up again, imagine that????? Only Crawford could deliver banal lines with a completely straight face and she does give it her all, but the movie is just too silly to be taken seriously. Please watch it if you are teetering on the brink of insanity.</p>
