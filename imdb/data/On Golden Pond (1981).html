<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed "On Golden Pond".  I wanted to see it, because Henry Fonda won his only Best Actor Oscar for it.  Since I'm a Henry Fonda fan, I thought I should watch the movie the Academy considered his best.  When I watched it, I really enjoyed it!  It makes you not want to take life for granted, in any way.  For Norman, he learns not to take life for granted by enjoying it.  He also learns not to be so crotchety, and not to dote on death.  His daughter, Chelsea, learned to forget about her differences with her father, and to love him while she can.  Katharine Hepburn also gives a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance as Ethel Thayer, Norman's devoted wife.  She helps him in more ways than the audience realizes, because she tries to make him feel young, which is what he needs.  "On Golden Pond" is a wonderful movie with a combination of drama and comedy that makes for an entertaining experience.  I recommend this movie to everyone!</p>
