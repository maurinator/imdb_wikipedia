<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Georgina throws a sleepover party for her friend Jamie, a moderately successful actress, on the night of Jamie's fianc√©e's bachelor party. Jill, Jamie, Marcy, Rachel, and Georgina have been friends since childhood, and as the evening progresses they talk about a variety of topics: Georgina's heterosexual fantasies and her uncertainties about Chris, her live-in lover; Jamie's doubts and insecurities about marriage; and all of their attitudes toward sex and sexual fantasies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this movie...whether you are 18 or 80, I think everyone can relate to this story. It is a group of friends that spend the night together before a major life changing event. it shows how they deal with certain situations. The title is misleading but I don't think that this movie should be shot down just because they don't deliver a porn. It's more of a movie for a night in with some of your closest friends. It has many instances that can be seen as points that every friendship goes through. there are secrets that are hidden from some friends that come out in the end and sibling rivalry is also apparent. the character of chris seems out of place at times but in the end she pulls everyone together.</p>
