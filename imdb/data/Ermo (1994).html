<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Appealing to one of the most basic themes of human nature-- the grass is always greener.... Ermo struggles to regain her family's lost prestige in a remote mountain village and win back her son's straying attention and allegiance(?) by winning the battle of keeping up (and beating) the Jones's-- Chinese style.What could have been a very heavy handed commentary on the perils of capitalist greed turns out of be a extremely charming comic satire instead. Clearly, one of the most overlooked and underrated Chinese films of its time! There's still a morality tale here but it's a genuinely delightful one replete with an endearing heroine, a whiny husband, and the delightfully wicked neighbor-lady-next door. There aren't many films that can serve up a palatable cautionary tale with a side of noodles to boot-- but this one certainly does. This film is definitely a must for Chinese film fans.</p>
