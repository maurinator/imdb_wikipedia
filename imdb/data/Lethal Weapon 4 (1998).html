<p>Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, after escaping death from the previous movies are put on a hit list by The Triads. When blood thirsty mercenaries are on their tail they team up again with Leo Getz and Lorna Cole, a newcomer (Chris Rock) to finally put an end to the Triads for good.</p>
<p>Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, each now feeling too old to be doing what they're doing, try to stop the Chinese Triads from doing their illegal business in the U.S. Uncle Benny, Chinatown's mob boss, has imported Chinese slaves to pay for an artist to create counterfeit Chinese currency which the Triads (led by Jet Li) will use to buy the Four Fathers (heads of the Triads) back from the Chinese military. Chris Rock joins the team as a new cop and Rianne's husband. Lorna is pregnant and considers marriage with Riggs, and Leo Getz is back, now as a private investigator.</p>
<p>Riggs und Murtaugh sto√üen durch Zufall bei einem Angelausflug auf ein Schiff voll gefangener chinesischer Immigranten. Der nichts ahnende Murtaugh nimmt die Chinesen bei sich zu Hause auf. Eine Entscheidung mit fatalen Folgen, denn die asiatische Mafia hat ausgerechnet an dieser Familie ein hohes Interesse. Damit ist ein Zusammenprall zwischen dem Copteam und der asiatischen Unterwelt vorprogrammiert.</p>

After a wild gunfight against a group of Chinese men who were on the freighter, it is discovered that the freighter is full of illegal Chinese immigrants. As Murtaugh sulks over what is left of his now sunken yacht, he discovers a hidden Chinese immigrant family and their patriarch, Mr. Hong, and decides to take them in. At the police station, Detective Ng expresses his belief that Chinatown crime boss Benny "Uncle Benny" Chan is behind the smuggling.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lethal Weapon 4 is an excellent,entertaining Action-packed and hilarious conclusion to the Lethal Weapon series that is filled with great direction,exciting Action,a memorable villain and a great score. Although not as good as the first three films,Lethal Weapon 4 is an Action to watch if you liked the first three Lethal Weapon's.Lethal Weapon 4 finds Riggs(Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)having to deal with Chinese criminals including a deadly criminal named Wah Sing Ku(Jet Li)who are smuggling Chinese slaves into the United States and have to stop them. With the help of new partner Lee Butters(Chris Rock)Riggs and Murtaugh have to deal with the Chinese criminals as well as Riggs becoming a parent,Murtaugh becoming a Grandfather and getting old and the gang is all back for more laughs and thrills.Lethal Weapon 4 is a Action-packed and funny conclusion to the Lethal Weapon franchise and every main character is back. Every franchise or film series comes full circle and the Lethal Weapon series is no exception and the Lethal Weapon series goes out with a bang with this film. Now,Lethal Weapon 4 since it's release has divided fans with some loving the film and some hating the film,I fall right into the former category because I liked this film and the other Lethal Weapon films for what they are:thrilling,Action filled,funny movies. Right from the explosive opening Lethal Weapon 4 is a film filled with Action and great laughs taking what worked in the first three films and adding it to this film. LW4 is funny and is probably the lightest of the films in terms of Comedy and Humor with the characters Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Butters and the moments and dialog between the characters is hilarious and memorable. While LW4 is an Action-Comedy the film at it's heart is about getting old and change especially with Riggs and Murtaugh because Riggs and Murtaugh have been through a lot of things throughout the series getting into crazy adventures and even though the two have survived and had success Riggs and Murtaugh realize that they are not getting any younger and success won't come as fast. The change comes when Riggs realizes he's going to be Father with Lorna Cole(Rene Russo)and Murtaugh being a GrandFather of Rianne's(Traci Wolfe)and realize they can't be cops and take risks forever. Each sequel introduces new characters throughout the series. In LW2 it was Leo Getz,in LW3 it was Lorna Cole and in this film it is Lee Butters and Wah Sing Ku. Lee Butters is a character who works with Riggs and Murtaugh and brings laughs and one liners and is the opposite of Riggs and Murtaugh and is the new generation of cop. The character will divide viewers some will like him and find him funny while others will feel that Butters doesn't belong in the film but I like the character for his laughs and loudmouth energy. The villain Wah Sing Ku is pure evil and is physically the most challenging bad guy Riggs and Murtaugh have ever have to face because Wah Sing Ku is so quick and can take your head in one second without hesitation and he doesn't have to say much words because he is that menacing. Every time Wah Sing Ku shows up a there is tension all around and you will feel like something is going to happen when Wah Sing Ku is around. LW4 like the other films moves at a wonderful pace and never slows down until the end. The Action and fight scenes are great and each Action scene is raised to a higher level each time and there is suspense and nice build up to each Action scene. The ending of the film is excellent because it is filled wonderful Action,Laughs and heart and will have viewers smiling at the end and it is a great cap off to this excellent series.The cast does amazing jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover do excellent jobs one last time as Riggs and Murtaugh once again having great chemistry. Joe Pesci is hilarious once again as Leo Getz and has great scenes with Gibson,Glover and Rock. Rene Russo is fantastic as Lorna Cole and has good scenes with Gibson. Chris Rock is great and funny as Riggs and Murtaugh's new partner Detective Lee Butters. Jet Li is menacing and believable as Wah Sing Ku,one of the villains of the film. Kim Chan is wonderful as Benny "Uncle Benny" Chan,a Chinese crime boss. Steve Kahan(Capt. Ed Murphy), Mary Ellen Trainor(Dr. Stephanien Woods),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)and Eddy Ko(Hong)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and energy especially with the Action scenes. Great direction,Donner.The score by Eric Clapton,Michael Kamen and David Sandborn is great and intense and matches the tone of this film. Another great score from Clapton,Kamen and Sandborn. There are also songs by War(Why Can't We Be Friends)and Eric Clapton(Pligrim). Wonderful songs.In final word,if you love Action films and the Lethal Weapon franchise you will love Lethal Weapon 4,an Action-packed,hilarious conclusion to a great series that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.</p>
