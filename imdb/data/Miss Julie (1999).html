<h1>Miss Julie (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Midsummer night, 1894, in northern Sweden. The complex strictures of class bind a man and a woman. Miss Julie, the inexperienced but imperious daughter of the manor, deigns to dance at the servant's party. She's also drawn to Jean, a footman who has traveled, speaks well, and doesn't kowtow. He is engaged to Christine, a servant, and while she sleeps, Jean and Miss Julie talk through the night in the kitchen. For part of the night it's a power struggle, for part it's the bearing of souls, and by dawn, they want to break the chains of class and leave Sweden together. When Christine wakes and goes off to church, Jean and Miss Julie have their own decisions to make.</p>
<p>A footman seduces a count's daughter.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The word 'Strindberg' enticed me.  How close this movie is to the play, I have no idea.  But there are a few questions that marred the movie for me:  Why would the stablemen take the word of a scullery maid over a footman in giving up the horses for his escape?,  Why would the woman want to commit suicide?  What drove her mad?Having had a friend who did commit suicide, I know that in her last stages of depression she fell in love with an ex-con who delighted in telling us how he and his buddies killed another inmate at Kilby Prison with a broom handle.  She was highly educated, artistic and giving.....we all should have seen the signs.  So this woman's dalliance with an ambitious footman (who at first seems quite virtuous) is to be understood.See the movie and tell us how close it is to Strindberg himself.</p>
