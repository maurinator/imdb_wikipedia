<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The 25th Hour depicts the last day of freedom for a young man before he begins serving a seven-year jail term for drug dealing. Prowling through the city until dawn with his two close male friends and his girlfriend, he is forced to re-examine his life and how he got himself into his predicament, which leads to a shocking, disturbing finale.</p>
<p>Monty Brogan is about to start his last day of freedom before turning himself into the authorities and serving a seven-year term for drug dealing. He's a charming young man who had always dreamed of being a fireman, following in the working-class footsteps of his father, who has had to put up his bar in Queens as bond so that his son can stay out of jail until his sentence begins. Monty, named for Montgomery Clift, does not know how he managed to get himself into this predicament. It was easy money and it carried so many perks, and you'll feel more than a little sympathy for this young man who has managed to kill his own dream for courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. But before he goes to prison, Monty wants to have one last night out on the town with his two best friends. Frank Slattery is a bond trader, one of the best and most successful risk takers in a very risky business. The other is Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who envies his friends' lifestyles but who has no intention of ever giving up his job for the easy money, despite the disillusionment of teaching high school students in a tough school. The three young men enjoy the night into the early morning as they eat, drink, and visit the hottest spots in town. It's a sad night for Monty, but he has a plan that neither Frank nor Jacob know about--and it makes for a shocking ending to this brilliant and disturbing story.</p>
<p>Cornered by the DEA, convicted New York drug dealer Montgomery Brogan reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before facing a seven-year jail term.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When my girlfriend saw Ed Norton on the cover, she begged me to rent it. I figured Spike Lee is a decent director, and I've enjoyed plenty of Ed Norton films, so why not. The film has some interesting cinematic angles, and some cool lighting, but after that the movie (I cannot call it a film for that would imply art) had no other redeeming qualities.Norton was decent in his role. Hoffman wasn't very believable. Peeper was believable as a sleezy Wall Street guy (I should know). Dawson was good, but not memorable.The plot was boring (at best, if you convince yourself a plot even existed), and the much anticipated "shocking" and "surpirse ending" promised by other reviewers doesn't even exist! My girlfriend's crush on Ed Norton couldn't even convince her to continue watching after 45 minutes. That's how bad this movie is.</p>
