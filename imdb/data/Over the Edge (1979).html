<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of bored teenagers rebel against authority in the community of New Granada after the death of one of their own.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a teen movie that wasn't a 'teen' movie.The best thing about this was how it showed that the parents imagined need to raise their kids in a sanitized environment can lead to mind-numbing boredom. Then to petty crime. Then to worse. But at the same time, the kids weren't made out to be these confused little angels either. You sympathized with them while knowing they needed to take responsibility.Matt Dillion's debut is also his best film.Most of the young actors were inexperienced. Some of them haven't been seen since. But they all still did a HELL of a job. Why isn't Michael Kramer better known? He was brilliant.The one complaint I can come up with was some of the parents emotional overacting. Great film though.</p>
