<h1>Operation C.I.A. (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young CIA agent is assigned to Saigon to stop a planned political assassination.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Burt Reynolds who has contributed some hard as nails characters over the years, provides his usual touch of class to this low budget 1960's flick.Plot In A Paragraph: Central Intelligence Agent Mark Andrews is dispatched to Saigon in an attempt to stop a potential assassination attempt on a US Ambassador.In his first leading role in a movie, a clean shaven Reynolds isn't really given much to do, except run around a lot and try ad make some of the worst choreographed fight scenes seem plausible.Reynolds would go on to greater things, I don't think anybody else in this movie did.</p>
