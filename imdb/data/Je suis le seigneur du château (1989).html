<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie 11 years ago, when I was almost the age of the protagonists, and it looked so real and intense to me that even for long later I still was impressed and didn't want to see it again. If you watch it, you'll probably understand why.Thomas (Régis Arpin) is the 12-year-old son of a millionaire who lives in a big mansion surrounded by woods in France. When his mother dies, his father hires a widow maid to take care of all while he is away. The woman brings her only son, Charles, to live with them and, hopefully, make company to lonesome Thomas. The rich boy and the poor one become enemies from the very first encounter. Moved essentially by jealousy and fear, Thomas decides to turn Charles' life into hell, especially after their parents eventually fall in love. As the title suggests, he wants to make clear to the 'invader' who is the lord of the castle.American audiences will compare it to "The Good Son", but Macaulay Culkin is a hundred feet below what Régis Arpin does in this movie. Childish cruelty here is not a psycho obsession, but rather a mean of defense which is later surpassed.Yet, it's the best French film I ever watched, even though I was that young boy the first time. By then, the end of the film seemed quite enigmatic to me. Years later, I thought I had found the clue and I had a certainty about it. By seeing it again, I believe it was really intended to be enigmatic, and there are no certainties to have: only a child's eyes are able to perceive.</p>
