<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maybe its because I remember seeing this movie on TV so often when I was younger that I still think its hilarious. Its not the best comedy, but some scenes are really funny in a cheesy, early '80s sort of way. Lily Tomlins smile could brighten up any film, and this was directed by Joel Schumacher. I never could figure out why the cinematography in some scenes is so soft, and he actually employs some of the same visuals he would use in later movies. I like how her entire neighborhood seems to be living in a commercial ("Pat, its BoatSheen!") and I think her narration is particularly funny. Give it a chance, don't expect much, and enjoy it for the character actors in bit parts.</p>
