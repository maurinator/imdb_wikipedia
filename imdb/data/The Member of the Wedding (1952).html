<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a small Georgia town, twelve year old tomboy Frankie Addams feels unconnected to the world, a fact troubling to her. Her unconventional views for a twelve year old girl make her an outcast among her peers, which she in turn blames for her situation rather than anything of her own doing. Her only real friend is John Henry, her younger next door neighbor, although she doesn't see him as a friend since she doesn't consider him a peer. As her widowed father is all consumed with running his small business, Frankie is largely left to the care of their housekeeper, Berenice. Berenice tries to provide as much true guidance to Frankie and what Frankie considers her problems, although Berenice has her own troubles looking after her wild foster brother, Honey Camden, her only surviving family. In addition, Frankie largely sees Berenice's advice as the rantings of a large, crazy black woman. Frankie believes that she has finally found her place in life upon the return to town and announcement by her older enlisted brother Jarvis that he is getting married to a woman named Janice. Immediately upon seeing Jarvis and Janice together, she falls in love with "them", believing she can be a "member" of "them" by leaving town with them immediately following the wedding. Frankie even wants to change her name to Jasmine to feel more connected to them as they will all then have a name "Ja__". Two negative situations following the wedding - one in reaction to her finding out that she can't go with Jarvis and Janice - may however put Frankie in the right direction to truly finding her place in life.</p>

<p>A young tomboy named Frankie is forced to face her own immaturity as a result her older brother's wedding.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On my very first viewing of The Member of the Wedding, I was stunned by its beauty, overwhelmed by its simplicity, captivated by its charm. A seemingly simple story of a young girl's attempt at growing up, this film takes us on a tumultuous and painful journey through the mind of Frankie Addams, a journey so fraught with twists and turns of emotion, we are barely able to keep up! Frankie's journey through adolescence is not an ordinary one. Her disapproval bordering on hatred of herself is bringing her to the edge of her world, and at times we are left wondering whether she has gone too far to ever come back. Her rebellion toward her journey is fierce, and Julie Harris is brilliant in her interpretation of a confused, angry young girl at odds with her world. If I had to make a list of the twenty movies that had the greatest impact on me in my lifetime, The Member of the Wedding would have to make the list. Ethel Waters is as charming and heart rending as she was in Pinky in this never to be forgotten film. I would suggest that it be used in the classroom as required viewing for students between the ages of twelve and fifteen, if only to give them a heroine with whom to share the sometimes chaotic journey from child to young adulthood.</p>
