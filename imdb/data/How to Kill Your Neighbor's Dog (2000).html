<h1>How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shy, chain-smoking, insomniac Peter McGowan is an L.A. playwright with a string of hits that preceded his current ten years of failed productions. His mother-in-law is sinking into senility, a stranger is meandering the neighborhood claiming to be him, neighbors have a new dog that barks all night; his wife wants to have a child, and he does not: he's become impotent. He's working on a new play when a single mom moves in next door with her 8-year-old daughter. His wife immediately invites the girl into the McGowan household. Will this child stir Peter's paternal feelings? Will she also help him get his dialogue right? And what of his doppelganger and the neighbor's dog?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog is a smart, funny, original comedy for grownups - a rare pleasure these days.  The witticisms fly fast and furious, but Kenneth Branagh, as playwright Peter McGowan, has the verbal dexterity to toss them off naturally.  It's a pleasure to be reminded of what a versatile and accomplished actor he is in non-Shakespearean roles.  The main plot of the movie, which involves Peter's reluctance to have children, and his growing relationship with a neighbor child, flirts with sentimentality, but avoids it thanks to the sharp writing and performances.  The style of the movie and its original, quirky subplots lift it well above the ordinary.</p>
