<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excruciatingly long and tedious comedy-drama from Walt Disney concerning "typical" Midwestern family on vacation in Europe. There's the worrisome father (Fred MacMurray, acting befuddled, like Jimmy Stewart); the giddy mom (Jane Wyman, dignified but dulled-out); the cold-fish daughter; the too-cool teenage son (in ascots!); and the mischievous little brother (named Skipper!). Directed by Disney mainstay James Neilson, whose pacing was always a little slow, the film is not only out-of-touch, but hammy and unfunny. It would make a torturous double-bill alongside another Disney teens-and-their-parents tale, "Superdad". * from ****</p>
