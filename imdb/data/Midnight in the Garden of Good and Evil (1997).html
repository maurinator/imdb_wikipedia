Along the way he encounters the irrepressible Lady Chablis, a drag queen commedienne, Sonny Seiler, lawyer to Williams, whose famous dog UGA is the official mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs, an odd man who keeps flies attached to mini leashes on his lapels and threatens daily to poison the water supply, the Married Ladies Card Club, and Minerva, a spiritualist. Between being Jim's buddy, cuddling up to a torch singer, meeting every eccentric in Savannah, participating in midnight graveyard rituals and helping solve the mysteries surrounding Billy's murder, Kelso has his hands full.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>`Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' hands one a magnifying glass, a mirror, and a chair by a sun soaked window while we read a published diary. After finishing the second trip into that Savannah party I realized why John Berendt's story brought me back.  John Kelso knew more about those amenities that surrounded him in the form of Faberge eggs, polite party kisses and mysterious covered up landscapes. Some have said that the film length was a negative not to be overcome.  On the contrary it seemed almost a necessityÂ… like those long lazy warmth soaked southern nights listening to the slowness of Spanish moss the two and a half hours seemed relaxing and intriguing.  Some things take time to soak in, like a stab in slow motion, the deception of Jim Williams set fades in and out in pools of gossiping chatter and thirstless drinkers. With a cast of smooth talking, cigarette toting originals, from ravenously stunning Chablis to ex-barrister piano banging Joe to prophetic Minerva there are eccentricities for anyone to appreciate and adore.  I have chosen to do so and will again I am sure.</p>
