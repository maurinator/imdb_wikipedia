<h1>Last Wedding (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three couples in Vancouver navigate their relationships: first jobs, first crises, professional jealousy, an affair, and lack of communication. Noah and Zipporah marry after a brief courtship. She wants to be a singer and stalls out when she fails. He's working hard at a business that may go under. Sarah and Shane are architects; he can't handle her success at a downtown firm. Leslie is a librarian, sour and prickly; her mate, Peter, is a college teacher whose head is turned by a student. Can any of these couples sort things out and stay together? Should they?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an amusing and believable story about three young couples who are not particularly well suited to each other.  They all discover this, but one couple has to get married to find this out.  The film is set in Vancouver, which, for once, is not dressed up to be some American city.  It was nice to see Canadian references, such as Canada Council grants and the Cambie Street Bridge.  The film is very funny in a low keyed, unhysterical, thoroughly Canadian way.</p>
