<h1>Cracking Up (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Warren Nefron is a hopeless klutz who has some of the worst luck in the world: when he tries to end it all with a foolproof suicide plan, he still manages to mess it up. In desperation, he goes to a psychiatrist to see if there is some way for him to end his troubles. As the doctor talks with him, the film cuts to a series of shorts about scenes from Nefron's life, and the lives of the people around him.</p>
<p>Suicidal nerd seeks help from psychiatrist, runs into various nutty characters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The final Lewis directed opus is his finest. He has never been funnier or more inventive. In the opening sequence, Jerry gets every laugh possible with vinyl. Of course the sequence goes on much too long, but that is exactly what you expect from Jerry. The French costume sketch is very clever. The best gag sequence in the film concerns the waitress and her listing of salad dresssings. I laugh every time I think of this sequence. Most people consider "The Nutty Professor" to be the best Lewis film, but this one is much more fun. I also recommend the first Lewis directed film, "The Bellboy", where Lewis is out to prove that he is a worthy writer-director.</p>
