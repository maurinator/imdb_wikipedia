<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first saw this film I thought that it was brilliant.  At first it seemed to have an amateurish quality about it, but this turned out not to be true.  What I thought was amateurish about it turned out to be the sound. The ever present ocean seems to add to the sound quality as if the viewer were really there, experiencing what actually happened.This is undoubtedly one of Oliver Platt's best roles.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the intriguing Mr.Fawkes.  Lee Evans was also unbelievably riveting in his portrayal as the mentally disturbed young man.This film is very representative of the small town in Britain with it's quiet undisturbed population that seems to be frozen in time, in contrast to Fawkes's father's life in America, which is busy and ever-changing, where the most important thing in life is money, as opposed to memories being just as important back in the small British town.The best part of the film is watching (in small parts) the unravelling of the horrific event that had happened so many years before and turned the young man (played by Lee Evans) into the person he is today.A riveting watch.  See it.</p>
