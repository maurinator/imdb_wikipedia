<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Navajo police officer is mixed up in drug smuggling and murder on the reservation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For using native actors, I give it a 10 of 10. The production values are rather poor, but then again, they used a lot of local people for grips, etc. Many shots with the sound boom in them.This film was never distributed, so the editing was never really finished. Those shots with the boom could have been optically cropped. The sound very often picks up too much..for instance late in the film, in Leaphorn's house, the ticking of a clock near the mic almost drowned out the conversation.Chee is supposed to be somewhat quiet, slow to move, but Phillips might have taken that a bit far.Overall, it's fairly faithful to the book.</p>
