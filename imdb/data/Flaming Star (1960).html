<h1>Flaming Star (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>West Texas in the years after the Civil War is an uneasy meeting ground of two cultures, one white. The other native American. Elvis portrays Pacer Burton. The son of a white rancher (John McIntire) and his beautiful Kiowa Indian wife (Dolores DelRio). When fighting breaks out between the settlers and natives, Pacer tries to act as a peace maker, but the "flaming star of death" pulls him irrevocably into the deadly violence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of Elvis's best films.   Legendary film director Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dirty Harry) gets the most out of Elvis and the King proves here that when he had something of substance to work from, he was more than capable. This film not only has a gripping and tragic storyline, it looks and feels authentic enough in dealing with an important chapter in American history.  The film is packed with emotional moments and action and an all round good cast.   If Elvis had gotten more film roles like this one, he could have become one of the great movie stars. 8 out of 10.</p>
