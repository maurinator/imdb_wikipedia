<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short film holds a special place in my heart as I remember watching it every Christmas on ABC.  Then my parents bought the movie, and we would play it every year while we were decorating the Christmas tree.Now, I get to watch it again on the 'Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse' DVD, and it's as good as ever!  The use of classic and obscure Disney characters in this timeless Charles Dickens story is fantastic!  Major characters like Mickey, Goofy, Donald, Daisy, and Jiminy Cricket fit in nicely to their roles, as does the rare characters (Scrooge McDuck, Pegleg Pete, The Giant, and the cast of Mr. Toad).For Disney fans, animation fans, and Christmas fans, this movie is a great addition to your collection.  For me this is truly a magnificent Christmas classic, and will be a favorite of mine for years and years to come!My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)</p>
