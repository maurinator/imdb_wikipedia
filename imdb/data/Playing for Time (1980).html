<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This moving human Drama is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen.Vanessa Redgrave is superb and strong as Fania FÃ©nelon, a jewish singer fromFrance ending up in Auschwitz, and makes the role of her life.I would say it is as important and grand as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist', about the horrors of the Holocaust.So, why is this not available on video? I've been trying for years to get hold of a copy of this moving drama.. and nobody seems to know who's holding thecopyright... It's really a shame that this classic is not available on dvd!!</p>
