<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this film on British television quite a long time ago.  I remember it as being a perfectly acceptable black and white British comedy, in the style of the better Carry On movies.  Despite a cast of successful British comic actors, it is really memorable for the performances of star Kenneth Connor, whose character I seem to recall disguises himself as a woman and a Scottish scientist (there may have been other disguises that I can't remember so well).  Connor was surely the most versatile and underrated actor of the Carry On ensemble, and this film showcases him at his best.</p>
