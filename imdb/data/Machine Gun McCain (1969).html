<h1>Machine Gun McCain (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tough criminal Hank McCain gets released from prison after serving twelve years for armed robbery. Hank hooks up with his son Jack, who has devised a daring plan to rob a Las Vegas casino. Unbeknownst to Hank, Jack is also involved with volatile and ambitious mob capo Charlie Adamo, who uses Hank as a pawn so he can gain control of Vegas territory that's currently being run by the formidable Don Francesco De Marco.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Falk's performance as a ruthless gangster was the best part of this movie.What undermines this movie is McCain's stupidity.  Even when he knows that the Mob is looking for him he goes to his friends and ex-wife for help. Doesn't he know they are the first places the Mob would look ?  Didn't he have a plan for how to disappear with the money ?</p>
