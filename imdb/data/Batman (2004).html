<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This animated adventure series of Bruce Wayne -- billionaire by day, crime fighter by night -- starts as Wayne balances life as a free-wheeling bachelor with his role as the Caped Crusader. He's joined on occasion by Robin and Batgirl. Black Mask, Killer Moth, the Everywhere Man and a brand-new Clayface join the Joker, Penguin and Riddler in ceaselessly tormenting Gotham City. Can Batman stop them once and for all?</p>
<p>A young Bruce Wayne is in his third year of trying to establish himself as Batman, protector of Gotham City. Living in Gotham, a metropolis where shadows run long and deep, beneath elevated train tracks, this younger Batman will confront each of his familiar foes for the first time.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like this show especially season 5. Having Batman team up with Justice League heroes is an awesome idea. I know that there is lots of people that don't like this show and I see why. I hate the look of several of a few of the villains. I don't like Joker's look the most. I'd like it if he looked close to the way that he looked like in Batman TAS. I have no problem with any of the episodes. Robin and Batgirl are great sidekicks. I don't like that Batgirl got introduced first. I think that Robin should have been introduced first. I'd like it if there was more of an origin story for Batman. I'd like it if the villains had longer origin stories.</p>
