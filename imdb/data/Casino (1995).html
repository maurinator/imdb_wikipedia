<h1>Casino (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This Martin Scorsese film depicts the Janus-like quality of Las Vegas--it has a glittering, glamorous face, as well as a brutal, cruel one. Ace Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, mobsters who move to Las Vegas to make their mark, live and work in this paradoxical world. Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence.</p>
<p>In 1975, bookie and expert handicapper Sam Rothstein - Ace to his friends - goes somewhat legitimate when the Chicago based Italian Mafia hires him to run the Tangiers Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Ace can do the job, applying for his gaming license despite his past, while having his ever changing job title be anything but running the casino and the actual license getting lost in the never ending process. Ace's best friend from childhood Nicky Santoro, eventually comes along for the ride, he who the Mafia hires to be Ace and the organization's unofficial protector. Ace is able to make a success of the casino, which includes the process of the Mafia bosses being able to skim profits off the top, while making the entire business look legitimate to the authorities. Ace's success is placed into jeopardy by Nicky, not only by his reckless, violent, volatile and ruthless behavior, but also by his want to eke out his own gangster fiefdom in Las Vegas. It is also placed into jeopardy by who becomes Ace's wife, Ginger McKenna, who he knew was a hustler when he married her and who he wants to trust in every aspect of the word in his love for her. She ends up being a self-destructive woman, her primary weakness being in wanting to help a friend, a hanger-on and loser named Lester Diamond.</p>
<p>Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a mob-connected casino operator in Las Vegas, attempts a civilized lifestyle with his money-conditional wife, Ginger. Nicky Santoro, a boyhood friend of Ace and now a Made-Man of the Mafia, arrives in town with an ambitious agenda of his own that soon disrupts Ace's life.</p>
<p>Greed, deception, money, power, and murder occur between two best friends, a mafia underboss and a casino owner, for a trophy wife over a gambling empire.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese "Casino" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tablesBut he had a fatal flaw 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money 'Ace' knew that but he didn't careWhat he wanted was to marry her Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desiresJoe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcerThe clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic</p>
