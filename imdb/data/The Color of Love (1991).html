<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Interracial love story told from the point of view of a white woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent film dealing with a black basketball star who has a child with a white woman and then sues for the custody of the child.Amazingly, his wife is understanding and wants the child for themselves.What makes the movie so appealing is that the white woman, a tramp in every sense of the word, matures as the situation develops and proves her competency as a mother to the black-looking child. The story, which really could have emphasized her bimbo way of life, does not and instead becomes a well-worth seeing sociological drama.After the black couple are denied custody, they appeal on the grounds that since the child is black, he would be better off with them for racial reasons. The defense will argue that this reasoning is discriminatory in itself, while admitting that the child will face discrimination in his life.This film takes place in Canada and the ending is worthwhile and quite conciliatory.</p>
