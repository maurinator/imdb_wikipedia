<h1>Cry, the Beloved Country (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>South African church minister Steven Kumalo is summoned from his village to Johannesburg. There he finds that his son Absolom has been jailed in connection with a robbery in which a white man was killed. The father of the white man, James Jarvis, is a supporter of apartheid, the separation of the races which is the law of South Africa. When they encounter each other, both Kumalo and Jarvis come to unexpected realizations not only about their sons, but about the nature of their own humanity.</p>
<p>A South-African preacher goes to search for his wayward son who has committed a crime in the big city.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a wonderful movie, based on the famous book.  It features excellent camera work, which took full advantage of the beautiful scenery in the South African countryside.  It also features an exceptional score by John Barry. In addition, the performances were quite good, although I've heard some people say they thought that James Earl Jones made Rev Kumalo too "soft around the edges".  In any case, this is a quite good movie.</p>
