<p>This is a truly marvelous little film. The world as seen through the eyes of young Japanese twin boys in a post-war rural village. Full of drama and humor, as well as magical criticism from a trio of old women. Not only an intimate look at childhood but at Japanese life as well. An excellent film.</p>
