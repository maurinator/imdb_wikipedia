<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked Jason Scott Lee's portrayal of Bruce Lee, but I noticed many inaccuracies in the story. If I had not seen the AMC special on Lee last year, I would not have a problem.-according to Linda Lee, Bruce was not hurt when competing for the right to teach whoever he wanted to. He hurt himself when he didn't stretch properly for a workout in 1970. That was the big inaccuracy-Bruce auditioned for another role in early 1965 before the role of Kato was offered to him.other roles he took in America were completely ignored: "Marlowe", hisappearances on "Longstreet", etc...the movie went right from 1967 to 1972 within a minuteIf you want to see a really good special on Lee, as well as see lost footage from a project that was butchered after he died, check out the AMC documentary. -</p>
