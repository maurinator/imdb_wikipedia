<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a masterpiece in all aspects.  Of course, it's not for those looking for action or a fast-paced plot -- this film allows you to meet and get to know the characters with their virtues and foibles.  The cinematography is incredible and John Barry's score is matchless; one of the very few scores which would diminish a film if absent.  Meryl Streep was robbed of the Oscar; her meticulous German/Danish accent was first-rate. If I had to name the weakest attribute of the film, it's the casting of Robert Redford as Denys.  He did a fine job, and it was understandable that he was cast in that role, due to his bankability, but in reality, Denys was not American.  Redford is a bit too all-American for this role, but it's a minor detraction.  This film is my next purchase on DVD -- I've seen it dozens of times and I never tire of it.</p>
