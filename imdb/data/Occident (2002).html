<p>Occident is a bittersweet comedy that focuses on the growing tendency of Eastern European youth to migrate west. When the amicable Luci (Alexandru Papadopol) and his beautiful lover Sorina (Anca Androne) are evicted from their apartment, Sorina decides they must visit her father's grave and ask for a "sign". Seconds later, Luci is hit in the head by a bottle and taken to the hospital by a Frenchman. Despite her love for Luci, Sorina believes a life with security takes precedence over romance, and moves in with the good samaritan. Meanwhile, a jilted bride (Tania Popa) and her mother (Coca Bloos) enlist the help of of a private agency to find a proper husband for her, but the wealthy Italian man they select has more than a couple of undesirable traits. Later, Michaela's (Popa) father, a police captain, finds out that Luci's cousin is dead, prompting him to remember when the two boys fled from Romania by swimming across the Danube on an inflatable doll. The cousin had made it across, but Luci had been arrested and thrown into prison.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are Romanian, Ex-Romanian, if you live or have lived in Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain, if you want to emigrate to the West, then you might suck up every detail of the film and find it good.If not, like me, you could fall into sleep already within the 15 first minutes already, wake up later on and try desperately to find a clue. Occasionally you have to smile a bit, because the film is not that bad. It will however be funnier for you to compare Romanian with Italian or Latin expressions: 'Politia' is written on the police car, for instance.This film consists mainly of views towards faces of speaking persons. The most sensational scene is the arrest of a thief by a police squadron. A dinner at McDonald's is also a special event. A ride and a discussion in the BMW of a temporary repatriate is another highlight.The cinema director informed the spare audience that it was hard to get a preview and a copy. Not on DVD and to be ordered directly from the film director in Bucharest. So why has this film found no distributor abroad? Because no one would go to watch it there.</p>
