<h1>For Pete's Sake (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Henrietta Robins works out of her home and her husband Pete drives a cab to try to support her. When Pete gets a tip from one of his fellow drivers that a deal will be made by the Americans and the Soviets over pork bellies, he decides to invest in the market, but needs to $3000 to invest. Henrietta then goes to extreme lengths to get the money by dealing with first a loan shark, then a madame, then the mob and finally cattle rustlers. All this in the name of love.</p>
<p>Young married Brooklynites Pete and Henry Robbins are madly in love with each other, despite their financial problems. Pete works as a cab driver, while Henry, the household money manager, does whatever odd part-time jobs she can, such as telephone sales. Pete learns through his dispatcher about a sure-fired investment in the commodity's market, specifically in pork belly futures, that will pay out huge dividends within a week. They need a minimum $3,000 to be able to invest, which is $2,700.38 more than they have. After trying through legal means, Henry, who would do anything for her husband, decides to borrow the money from a loan shark. Henry doesn't see the 20% weekly interest rate as a problem because the investment should pay off far more than that. Henry lies to Pete about the source of the money. Problems ensue for Henry when the investment doesn't pay off as quickly as Pete thought. So when the loan shark doesn't get his money back on time, he is after Henry unless he can "sell" Henry's contract. Even if the loan shark can sell the contract, will Henry be able to pay off the buyer any easier? And what will Pete do if he finds out either the source of the money and/or that Henry lied to him?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first 30 minutes or so of "For Pete's Sake" are amusingly on-target: Brooklyn housewife Barbra Streisand drops her husband off at work on their motorcycle and then pops a wheelie; she proceeds to forge a battle of the bills with the grocery store cashier, the insurance company, the banker, and the telephone company exec (Anne Ramsey, pre-"Throw Momma From The Train"). All this time, Streisand is in terrific comedic form, her expressions more and more incredulous. A dinner with her husband's relatives is equally funny, but "Pete" starts to give out somewhere after this. Barbra can't pay back loan sharks and has to work as a prostitute, a bomb deliverer and a cattle rustler. This last job gives the movie its big slapstick scene, which was a groaner even in 1974. Clearly a rip-off of Streisand's "What's Up, Doc?", it features a stampede of cows down the Columbia backlot accompanied by some of the silliest "country" music I've ever heard. If the filmmakers had kept the movie on a grounded level--and kept Streisand as the perfect Everywoman--this might have been a dead-on satire of the ailing economy. As it is, it's passable fluff. **1/2 from ****</p>
