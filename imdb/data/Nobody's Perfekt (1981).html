<h1>Nobody's Perfekt (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of a group of misfits living in Miami, and their revenge against government bureaucracy. After the city refuses to pay for the damage to their car caused by a pothole, the three friends, including one with constant short-term memory loss and another who is always jumping from personality to personality, decide to steal an army howitzer and 'persuade' the mayor to change his mind.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, it's far from fantastic and it's very unlikely that most people will ever see this movie, but for me it's one of my favorite silly movies from the 1980s.Kaplan, Karras, and Klein were all hilarious in this - especially Kaplan. I was a WELCOME BACK, KOTTER fan and I enjoyed him in that, but I think this movie was a far better showcase of what he could deliver as a comedic actor.I showed this movie to a friend recently and throughout it he kept saying how dumb it was, yet he was laughing a lot as he watched it. Yes, parts of it are "dumb" or downright silly, but this movie is a LOT of fun to watch.Bud Gott</p>
