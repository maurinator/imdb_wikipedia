<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Cadillac Man" is an in-your-face type of comedy, as it is a fast paced, relentless and very chaotic type of comedy. You might think that to be too much, but even though it never slows down or backs down, you are in for some good fun and good entertainment.The story is about Joey (played by Robin Williams), a car salesman pressed hard on his luck. Things are stacked up above his head, and everything comes tumbling down when his coworker Donna's disgruntled boyfriend Larry (played by Tim Robbins) show up at the car lot with guns and explosives.While this comedy is not one that will leave you in tears from laughing, the comedy used is straight to the point and it matches the outrageous feel there is to the entire movie.Robin Williams and Tim Robbins are performing quite well in this movie, and they do compliment one another acting side by side. I had seen this movie before, but I didn't remember that Fran Drescher was in the movie too, and she did a good job with her role as well.If you enjoy the Robin Williams movies and comedy then "Cadillac Man" should be watched. It is fast paced fun and is filled with great characters and good dialogue. Well-worth spending about an hour and a half on watching.</p>
