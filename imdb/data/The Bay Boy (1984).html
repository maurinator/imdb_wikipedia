<h1>The Bay Boy (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Roman Catholic teenage boy in Nova Scotia during the 1930s faces various growing-up problems: Should he become a priest? What should he do about the murder he witnessed, committed by a local cop and upstanding parishioner? And how far should he go with his girl friend, who happens to be the murderer's daughter?</p>
<p>It's 1937 in the coal mining town of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. Sixteen year old Donald Campbell is a good boy - attentive, polite and hard working, whether it be at home helping his father, Will Campbell, set up a bootleg soft drink bottling business in their basement, helping his mother, Jenny Campbell, attend to Donald's severely polio stricken older brother Joe, as an altar boy at the local Catholic church, or at school. Beyond financial issues associated with the Depression which have resulted in the family having a hard time trying to make ends meet, they have had their fair share of personal tragedies, including Joe's illness and the death of their only daughter Jean. Regardless, Jenny is a highly devout woman who wants Donald to become a priest. Although Donald does think about his mother's wishes, he thinks mostly about girls at this stage of his life. He is especially attracted to Saxon Coldwell, the daughter of one of the local police sergeants, although Saxon's sister, Diana Coldwell, is more open about her blossoming sexual desires for Donald. Donald's path into manhood and whether he will decide to enter the seminary are affected by these thoughts of the opposite sex, an encounter he has with a young visiting priest named Father Chaisson, and witnessing a murder committed by a person in authority.</p>
<p>A teenage boy living in a Cape Breton coal mining community during the 1930's finds himself contemplating life and is haunted by a murder he witnessed in town.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember when I was little & they were filming the Bay Boy in Glace Bay & it was very cool to have a movie shoot on the street where our church was. At the time though I was all - Keifer Who? The movie really is fantastic and funny and thrilling but at the time the thrill was that it was shot in our home town. They even had the premiere at the Savoy Theater in Glace Bay which for Glace Bay was a pretty big deal. Though not entirely surprising. The Writer / Director Daniel Petrie was born in Glace Bay.The CBC had aired this movie many times over the years. So it is quite possible it will air again. Luckily I still have a copy on tape. I've seen copies in the video store (not on DVD mind you - although it very well may be on DVD by now - I am not sure).A must see. Amazon.ca has the VHS listed.</p>
