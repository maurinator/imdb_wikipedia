<h1>Love at First Bite (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This vampire spoof has Count Dracula moving to New York to find his Bride, after being forced to move out of his Transylvanian castle. There with the aid of assistant Renfield, he stumbles through typical New York city life situations while pursuing Cindy Soundheim. But her boyfriend, Doctor Jeff Rosenberg, realizes she is under the influence of a vampire, and tries his bumbling best to convince police Lt Ferguson of what is going on, and to help him stop Dracula.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Say what you would like about Apocolypse Now, the Godfather, the Terminator films, the Alien series, Jaws, Rocky, Casablanca, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or even (gulp) the Star Wars Trilogy, but Love at First Bite is for me the all time greatest movie ever. I cannot escape the Dracula legend (In fact my first and middle name is Christofer Lee) so it only seems fitting that this is my favorite. I love the story of Dracula coming to "modern" New York, and falling in love with a swinging super model. It is full of the most hilarious things ever committed to film (Art Johnson anyone?). Some of the funniest things are unintentional, it is so seventies and it even picks up some of the things that are today clich√©s about the decade (again it is my man Art).The funniest banter between movie characters is at the beginning of the movie when Renfield identifies Gov't officials by the fact that they wear shoes. Get a copy of this, watch it and laugh for the next week. Everybody email WB and get them to release a DVD.My Rating **** 10/10 and 3 thumbs up. As always I encourage the free flow of ideas. God Bless!</p>
