<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Joe Don Baker is, in my eyes, a likeable enough lug who, like many actors, happened to grow a little older and a little thicker at a time when Hollywood had no tolerance for people who weren't under 30 and/or at least 45 percent post-consumer plastic.So wisely, Baker decided to switch from leading man roles to character roles; the big, rough-edged but likeable and honest cop roles like Mitchell and T.J. Geronimo.Baker's work in the late 70s and early 80s remind me of that one uncle that your parents didn't like to be around, but the kids loved and who was always the first one there to help when the family was in need.Anyways..."Final Justice" is probably as good a  movie as one could have expected from the producers of the European and kid-with-rich-parents-and-just-out-of-film-school cheap-offs that provide MST3K with so much of their schedule. Baker was believable in his role, as was his constantly frustrated yet admiring partner.Ladies and gentlemen, I doubt highly that Joe Don Baker looked at the script and saw it as his ticket to an E! Celebrity Profile. What he did see it as was a chance to stay busy, have fun and make a few bucks. And give him credit, he always puts his all into every film he does. How many performers can truly say the same?As hard as the MST3K gang laugh at Joe Don baker, he gets the biggest laugh of all. Their constant slaps at him are only keeping his career alive.If it wasn't for them, how many of you would be reviewing this movie?</p>
