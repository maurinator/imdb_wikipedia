<h1>The Pursuit of Happiness (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young college student is sent to prison as much for killing a pedestrian with his car as for not paying his parking tickets. When the opportunity presents itself he escapes and is subsequently on the run with his girlfriend. But how long can this situation last?</p>
<p>William Popper comes from a wealthy, traditionally Protestant family. His family and most of the established class see William as an anti-social crusader. Almost completed college in New York City, William is a compassionate but directionless man who has no idea what he will do with his life after he graduates. All he knows is that he loves his activist Jewish girlfriend, Jane Kauffman. His life changes when one rainy evening, he accidentally runs over and kills an elderly woman. In dealing with this situation, he wants to do the right thing at every turn, but doesn't like that to save himself from conviction and a prison sentence he has to be politically correct and put on a mask to satisfy those with authority. However, the more he tries to do the right thing, the more trouble he seems to get into. On an impulse, he seizes an opportunity so that he can get to a place where he feels he can make sense of life in general.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Usually these Young-People-against-The-System films from the late 60's-early 70's are populated with groovy-talking stoners, angry radicals, and even angrier authority figures (cops, parents, etc.) But this one dispenses with those cartoons. Sarrazin and Hershey play idealistic college students, but Sarrazin is realistic enough to understand he needs help from his family connections when he gets into trouble, and Hershey doesn't have a beat-the-system attitude when Sarrazin escapes from custody; in fact, she can't fathom why he was so stupid.It all revolves around an accident involving Sarrazin hitting a pedestrian with his car. It has nothing to do with campus politics and no attitudes are posed. The filmmakers don't try and truckle to the youth crowd by having the establishment types be played over-the-top. When Sarrazin mildly mocks the justice system, his lawyer played by E.G. Marshall shuts him up fast with a well-written lecture that reasonably explains Marshalls' viewpoint. And, noticeably, it is Marshall's law assistant, of the same age as Sarrazin, who is played as far more hard-core establishmentary than Marshall, or Sarrazin's father, played by Arthur Hill. The film also features a young Robert Klein, who is quite good as Sarrazin's buddy. It also features a small but striking performance from William Devane as an airplane pilot hired to help Sarrazin. Devane is on screen no more than thirty seconds before he becomes more interesting than anyone else in the film (although Sarrazin's grandma is quite a kick, even though one note). And yes, Hershey does show off her very nice young figure in a couple of scenes. Unfortunately, the film also features Randy Newman drone-singing one of his boring songs at the opening and closing.</p>
