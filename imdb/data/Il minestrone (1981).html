<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must say I'm not that Citti's fan. Nevertheless, I've been very curious watching this rare movie. And, well it's been a surprise. Despite of a poor photography, the actors and actresses starring, the plot, the poetry of images and words, made me think it was a little masterpiece. It's more than a movie, a metaphor. The hunger, the hunger for all. The need for food, adventure, knowledge, dreams. And dreams in fact seem to satisfy more than food itself. Giorgio Gaber, Dario Benigni, Franco Javarone, Daria Nicolodi, the director Citti, Ninetto Davoli are metaphors themselves of a lost way of making cinema, and , in one word, of describing Italy. Gaber's dry foolness, Javarone's Neapolitan way of helping people, Nicolodi's bourgeois sweetness, Benigni's sense for dream react with poor, simple philosophy played by Davoli and Citti. A sweet poem, a gentle flower.</p>
