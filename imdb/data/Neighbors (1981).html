<h1>Neighbors (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One man's quiet suburban life takes a sickening lurch for the worse when a young couple move into the deserted house next door. From the word go it is obvious these are not the quiet professional types who *should* be living in such a nice street. As more and more unbelievable events unfold, our hero starts to question his own sanity... and those of his family.</p>
<p>A quiet man's peaceful suburban lifestyle is threatened by the new, obnoxious couple that moves in next door.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Belushi and Aykroyd team up for a dark comedy unlike any I've seen.Earl (Belushi) is quietly living his life in the suburbs with his wife and daughter, but it takes a decided turn for the worse  when a lunatic (Aykroyd) and his wife move in next door.Earl's life is turned into a nonsensical nightmare by the new couple; Vic tells nonstop lies about everything including whether his 'home-made' spaghetti sauce came from a jar and if the spaghetti is from a non-existent Italian restaurant while his wife Ramona (Cathy Moriarty) alternately seduces and blackmails Earl.  Particularly funny is the segment in which Earl tries to sneak out in the middle of the night for a rendezvous with Ramona, only to be caught by Vic, who is awake, on his rooftop, and wearing scuba gear.I didn't really care for this movie the first time I saw it, because almost nothing made any sense.  Now, it's one of the few movies I've purchased.  I suppose it's an acquired taste, but don't give up too quickly on it.  After all, Belushi isn't making any new ones, is he?ps- Great musical score!  No instruments lend themselves to bizarre going-ons quite as readily as a trombone and kazoo.</p>
