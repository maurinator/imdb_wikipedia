<h1>Red Headed Stranger (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Revisionist western about fallen preacher Shay, who guns down his wife Raysha for running off with another man. Wandering, he meets single mom Laurie. However, helpless sheriff Scoby wants Shay to help him fight the villainous Clavers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Moves slowly as some have pointed out and Willie ain't exactly Gary Cooper, but the general plot line too many bitch about is hardly as off the wall as most of Eastwood's or Peckinpah's stuff. Royal Dano plays a great villain, and some of the lines are priceless. I particularly like the one where Katherine Ross asks (paraphrase) if a horse is worth a man's life and Willy answers "can't say- didn't know him." Now THAT is a moral tale.The closing gun fight scene is realistic and the old town looks like many did. Costuming is fine and the armorer did a good job. Willy's character is too complex for Willy to play completely well and Morgan Fairchild seems out of place, but that's probably why she ran away.Better than many and worth a two hour viewing.Emil Franzi, Tucson</p>
