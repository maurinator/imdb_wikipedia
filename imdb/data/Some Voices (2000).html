<h1>Some Voices (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film's central character, Ray (Daniel Craig), has schizophrenia. The story begins with Ray's discharge from psychiatric hospital. Ray's devoted brother Pete (David Morrissey) picks him up and drives Ray to his new abode, the spare room in Pete's West London flat. Pete is a chef who works long hours in the caf√© (a traditional 'greasy spoon' during the day and a trendy eatery in the evening) that he inherited from his father. He now has to find the time to take care of Ray and monitor the medication that controls the voices in his head. Ray is an intelligent, out-going young man. He soon falls for Laura (Kelly Macdonald), a Glaswegian girl in the midst of breaking up with her abusive boyfriend (Peter McDonald). Laura becomes attracted to Ray because of his spontaneity and his childlike sense of fun. Around this time, Pete also becomes involved in a relationship with Mandy (Julie Graham). As Ray's relationship blossoms, he begins to resent taking his pills, preferring to trust in the soothing properties of love. Over time, this decision has disastrous effects on all three relationships: the relationship between the brothers, Ray and Laura, and Pete and Mandy. Ray may cause disruption, concern and distress to those close to him but that is only a fraction of the distress his condition causes him. In the end, it is the relationship between the brothers that is central to the film. Pete is long-suffering but, despite all his frustration and resentment, his loving commitment keeps his brother from serious harm.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a film I saw completely "on spec" having not heard of it before. As is often the way, when there are no expectations to be dashed, the experience was entirely worthwhile.Without giving too much plot away, our hero - or more accurately our anti-hero - is discharged at the start of the film from a psychiatric hospital. He is returned, with a large supply of tablets, to his brother's care within "the community". When he falls for a woman, who reciprocates, life seems better than it has ever been, and he begins to question whether the endless tablets are actually necessary. This is a film which is above all honest. The performances are truthful and insightful, and the characters are drawn  sympathetically but not blandly. We are shown flaws and strengths, and we are invited to observe and empathise but not judge. The laughter - and it is not in short supply - comes from the foibles of the characters we are presented with, and as in life, provides a welcome relief from the more tragic elements. As the film moves towards its conclusion - via a 10 minute sequence of genuine breathtaking tension - the answers provided are not easy, and the loose ends are not tied up, yet this acts not to frustrate the viewer but simply to reinforce that this is the genuine article - life has no easy solutions. I have rated this film as a 9 out of 10; it lacks the  perception about the human condition, the wider scope or relevance of, say "American Beauty", but that was never its intention, and it is designed, I suspect, with a smaller audience in mind. It is, however, a beauty in its own right, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it as a thought- provoking way of spending a couple of hours.</p>
