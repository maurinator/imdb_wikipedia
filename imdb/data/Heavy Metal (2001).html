<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was kind of mystified by the fact that they made two sequels to "Turbulence", a movie that didn't do well with both critics and the box office. Finally seeing it several months ago, I could understand why. But I decided to see this second "sequel" (it has nothing to do with the events of the first movie... and probably the second movie as well) since I had the opportunity to see it for free.Well, this Canadian movie is one of the few that has something distinctly Canadian in it (the plane is flying to the city Toronto). And the production values aren't as cheap as with many Canadian films, though some of the interiors of the plane look kind of cheesy. (Plus, the stock footage used is VERY obvious, since it came from a much more expensive film.) Also, I found that the choice for the hero chosen to fight the villains on the plane kind of a surprise. Usually this particular kind of character in hostage situations like this remains helpless until the very end.That's about all that's positive I can say about this movie. While I didn't find the movie terrible, I did find it pretty dull. There are pretty much no surprises in this movie. If you've seen one hostage movie, you have seen this one. Plus, the movie took a surprisingly long time to unfold - 3/4 of the movie goes by before the good guys finally start fighting back.Note to Rutger Hauer fans - it's pretty obvious that all of his scenes were filmed in one day.</p>
