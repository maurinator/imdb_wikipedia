<h1>Rock All Night (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A rock and roll film intended for the drive-in, set in a bar where a new singer is auditioning. However, things get complicated when a pair of criminals turn up and take hostages to hold off the police. The payed-off local heavy-guy turns out to be useless, as does a professional boxer, but the situation is resolved by the plucky short guy with a chip on his shoulder (Dick Miller).</p>
<p>Cloud Nine, the local teen hangout, has been taken over by a pair of escaped killers, who hold the local teens hostage. The bartender realizes it's up to him to save the kids.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A muddled drama with Dick Miller as a young dude with a bad attitude who's hanging out in a bar when two crooks panic and take everyone hostage. Unfortunately this doesn't occur until halfway through the movie, leaving us in the meantime with overlong musical sequences and repetitive set-up.If the movie had focused on the hostage-taking portion of the plot then this could have been engrossing, but it's padded to the hilt with irrelevant dialogue and bar a wisecracking reporter none of the characters are engaging. A dull and uneven watch that made me wonder why I bothered.</p>
