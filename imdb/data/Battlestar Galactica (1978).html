<h1>Battlestar Galactica (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The leaders of the Twelve Colonies of Mankind are making plans to sign a peace treaty with their mortal enemies, the Cylon Empire. On the eve of the ceremony, the Cylons betray the pact and destroy most of the Colonies and their entire fleet. Under the command of Commander Adama, the battlestar Galactica leads the remaining Colonial ships into space and seeks out a lost thirteenth colony, which turns out to be Earth. Along the way, the Colonials encounter various races (both friendly and hostile), the legendary human warrior Commander Cain, and the planet Kobol, the motherworld of all the Colonies. All the while, the Cylons - under the command of human traitor Count Baltar - closely pursue this fugitive fleet across the universe.</p>
<p>In a distant galaxy, twelve planets bearing tribes of the race known as Mankind have been at war with a robotic alien race, the Cylon Empire, for a millennium. In the measurements used by the Twelve Colonies, it is the Yahren 7341, and a peace treaty is to be signed - a treaty that proves to be a ruse for the largest assault in the history of galactic warfare. With their defending warships destroyed and their homeworlds annihilated, the Twelve Tribes gather to their remaining warship, the battlestar Galactica, boarding every assorted star vehicle that will carry them, as their leader, Commander Adama, seeks out the one planet that will protect Mankind from the predation of the Cylons - a planet called Earth. As their journey proceeds, this fugitive fleet is closely pursued the Cylon forces under the command of human traitor Count Baltar.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Mankind, the last major fighter carrier leads a makeshift fugitive fleet on a desperate search for the legendary planet Earth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a very good, and very well made sci-fi classic.It has it's own style and feel to it, and unlike most sci-fi films it doesn't stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and lend siege to a bunch of aliens or space fights or whatever. It lays down themes that although seem a million light years away, are in fact maybe closer to our time than we first thought.With a riveting story, depth to characters and amazing memorable acting from Dirk Benedict, Richard Hatch, and Loren GreeneI think it is only suffice to say that this film is a marvel of it's genre and with criticism and technicalities aside I think you cannot argue that this film is great in all proportions.</p>
