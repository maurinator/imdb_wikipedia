<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw this on Saturday afternoon TV when I was in junior high and high school. A local TV station showed it again and again. It scared me silly then. It still works now (to a degree).People are being attacked and killed by what looks like a giant caterpillar.They (supposedly) kill it...but there are others.It's intelligent, quick (82 minutes) late 1950s big bug movie. The acting is pretty bad, but who watches a horror film for acting? The question is, is it scary and deliver shocks? This one does. The monsters themselves are very unpleasant-looking, one attack scene made me jump and there are some very gruesome looks at mutilated dead bodies ... quite extreme for a 1950s movie (this film is NOT for very young kids).Yes there is a lot of filler, but the dialogue is fairly interesting, everybody keeps a straight face and I was interested. So, it's an entertaining, well-done movie with great monsters and (for the time) good special effects. Well worth seeing.Why isn't this film better known?</p>
