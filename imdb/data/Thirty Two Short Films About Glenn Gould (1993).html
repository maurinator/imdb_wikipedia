<h1>Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As the title suggests, this dramatised documentary about the eccentric Canadian pianist Glenn Gould is broken up into thirty-two short films (mirroring the thirty-two part structure of Bach's 'Goldberg Variations', the recording that Gould made famous), each giving us an insight into some aspect of Gould's life and career. Out of respect for the music lead actor Colm Feore is never seen playing the piano, merely reacting to Gould's own recordings, which are extensively featured</p>
<p>A collection of vignettes highlighting different aspects of the life, work, and character of the acclaimed Canadian classical pianist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fascinating documentary on a fascinating subject - eccentric Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. The film prefers snapshot technique to straight narrative, and the leading character comes alive in Colm Feore's vivid performance. This one makes you believe that art is not dead as long as the people like Gould still exist.</p>
