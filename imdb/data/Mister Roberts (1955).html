<h1>Mister Roberts (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mister Roberts is aboard a US cargo ship, working in the Pacific during the Second World War. He'd do anything to leave the quiet of the ship to join in the "action". Trouble is, the captain of the ship, is a bit of a tyrant, and isn't willing to sign Roberts' transfer requests. Also on board is Ensign Pulver, who avoids work as best he can, whilst living off the riches of his buying and selling. Roberts and the crew are in constant battle, even over the smallest of disagreements.</p>
<p>Lt. (j.g.) Doug Roberts is the cargo officer aboard the USS Reluctant, a re-supply ship serving in the South Pacific. World War II is coming to an end. The Germans have surrendered and the war in Europe is over and while there is no end in sight for the war in the Pacific, Roberts is beginning to feel that it will all pass him by and he'll never see any action. He has repeatedly requested a transfer to a combat ship but his Captain, Lt. Cmdr. Morton, knows a good thing when he has it and in Roberts, he has one of the best cargo officers available. Roberts cares about his zany crew and is often the buffer between them and the Captain who is a strict disciplinarian and who has not allowed the crew ashore now for almost a year. In return for the Captain granting the crew shore leave, Roberts agrees to follow his orders without comment or objection. The men think he's let them down but when they learn that it was Roberts who got them their shore leave, they return the favor in their own fashion.</p>
<p>Comedy-drama about life on a not particularly important ship of the US Navy during WW2.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mister Roberts (1955) - CO-Directors: John Ford & Mervyn LeRoy Enough time had passed that Americans were able to laugh at some of the kookier aspects about military life and Hollywood provided just the right amount of seriousness and irreverence with this 1955 hit.Henry Fonda gave one of his career making performances in this film as a lieutenant in the Navy who feels that the action of the war is passing him by. Instead of fighting the enemy, he's engaged in a battle of wills with off kilter superior officer James Cagney, who also turns in one of his mythic-making performances.  The great William Powell is on board in one of his last roles as the friendly on board doctor. The late Jack Lemmon won an Academy Award for his supporting role of Ensign Pulver, a man who finally straightens his spine and takes macho Cagney on mano-a-mano. (Color)</p>
