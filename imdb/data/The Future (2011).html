<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Miranda July, a woman who is hard to describe, i went to see a talk she was doing in Sydney when she brought The Future down under to screen at the Sydney Film Festival and i have to say i haven't ever met or hope to meet anyone like her, she seems like too much work, she analyzes everything in an artistic way that is kinda lame if you ask me, but anyway, her previous film Me And You And Everyone We Know was a movie that i caught late one night on SBS and i was obsessed with it for a while after, i went straight out and bought the DVD and just watched it repeatedly because i thought that it was so great. So when The Future finally got a cinema release in Australia i went to see it and i must say that i was a little let down by it, i don't know if i was in the wrong mood when watching it or something but i just really didn't enjoy it near as much as i thought i would.I just found the whole thing to be too hipster and trying to be so arty, trying too hard and failing, there were a few parts that i really enjoyed in particular the cat commentary and the scenes with the older gentleman and the hairdryer, but with the exception of those scenes i found the whole thing pretty bland. I'm not sure if i just didn't get the message that was being put across but for me it just didn't work which is disappointing because i am a fan of Miranda July's style usually, i really enjoyed her collection of short stories.I mean this movie is going to impress a lot of people i'm sure, however i just think its a major step back from the terrific MAYAEWK. If you're a fan see it, if you're not i wouldn't bother because you most probably will not enjoy it, i feel bad writing this bad review but "it's just my opinion, and what do i know".If you enjoy it, great, if you don't, i told you so.</p>
