<h1>Droopy (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A jailhouse, a tempting safe... and a sleeping sheriff. Can the two villains make off with the loot without waking him up? Not if deputy Droopy has his way. Much of this cartoon is a remake of 'Rock-a-Bye Bear' (1952).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Much the same as Rabbit Rampage was to Duck Amuck, this is an inferior, yet somewhat enjoyable, remake of Rock-a-Bye Bear, made by the same animator as the original.  Still, this one has Droopy, who is one of my favorite characters of all time.</p>
