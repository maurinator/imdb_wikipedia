<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>No matter what mood I'm in, this film always sorts me out. I can't count the times I've watched it, at any time of the day or night. It is the most basic of love stories, showing that the ties that bind a family are often stretched to the limit, but cannot be broken. I have over 500 films in my collection and I don't think there's a more romantic moment in any, than when James Mason takes of his jacket and puts is round Diana Coupland's shoulders. I remember feeling the tenderness of that moment when I first saw the film in the cinema as a young teenager and now I am 50 and it still makes me shiver. There's never been another film which comes anywhere near it. My old video is just about played out and I've copied it on to DVD, but I would love to know if anyone has ever seen it for sale on DVD.</p>
