<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think that Charles Bronson's performance as an alcoholic washed up cop is great.  This is a great cop movie that doesnt fit the mold of most police films made.  It is entertaining, and though Arabella's mouth gets a little annoying the film holds your attention.  The villain in this film is unique and as mean as they come.  Check it out if you like Bronson!!</p>
