<h1>Under the Volcano (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Against a background of war breaking out in Europe and the Mexican fiesta Day of Death, we are taken through one day in the life of Geoffrey Firmin, a British consul living in alcoholic disrepair and obscurity in a small southern Mexican town in 1939. The Consul's self-destructive behaviour, perhaps a metaphor for a menaced civilization, is a source of perplexity and sadness to his nomadic, idealistic half-brother, Hugh, and his ex-wife, Yvonne, who has returned with hopes of healing Geoffrey and their broken marriage.</p>
<p>It's November 1, 1938 - the Day of the Dead - in Cuernavaca, Mexico, which is located in the shadows of Popocat√©petl. Geoffrey Firmin, British Consul to Mexico, has just quit his job. His best friend is a bottle of booze, as he constantly tries to drown out the world's and his own personal problems. The former category includes the Spanish Civil War, the rise of Nazism in Germany and the associated effect it has on Mexican nationalism. The latter category mostly concerns the divorce a year ago from his actress wife, Yvonne Fermin, who has left Mexico but has tried to keep in touch with him via correspondence. Despite she having written to him several times with her intentions (to which he never replied), Yvonne returns to Cuernavaca on this day to, on the surface, rekindle their marriage. A slight strain is placed on the proceedings by the fact that Geoffrey's younger half-brother, Hugh Fermin, is also in Cuernavaca. Hugh, who was covering the war in Spain, decided instead to come to Mexico to help his brother regain sobriety and thus his life. But a self-destructive Geoffrey may make Hugh and Yvonne's tasks difficult if not impossible.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very fine film indeed, and fascinating from a number of viewpoints: for one of the truly great characterization performances ever filmed, by Albert Finney, for its grim, unromanticized, portrayal of extreme alcoholism, for a career-defining performance by Jacquilene Bisset (she often looked this beautiful but she never looked so good,) for the stunningly effective portrayal of its Mexican setting, for memorably excellent supporting roles by a collection of grotesques that could have taught Fellini a thing or two, for the way Huston transforms the material into another episode in his obsessive theme of men from cold countries going too far in hot ones, and, in its last twenty minutes, for what has to be absolutely the sleaziest bar/brothel ever put on the screen. Highly recommended so long as you understand that what "happens" in this film is that you're given an embarrassingly intimate vision of people destroying themselves and each other. Definitely not for children, or for anyone who wants to come away from it with renewed optimism about the possibility for human happiness.</p>
