<h1>The Return of Martin Guerre (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the middle of the 16th century, Martin Guerre returns to his village in southwestern France, after being away in the war for almost a decade. The villagers who knew him as a young man suspect he is not Martin, but he seems to know all about his friends, his family and his wife, even the most unusual things. Is this man really Martin Guerre?</p>
<p>In medieval France, some villagers challenge a man's claim of identity when he (as he says) returns home from some time in the army.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my favorite movies, even if the ending is a heartbreaker.  Every Depardieu fan should have a copy - in French, not dubbed.  You can't help but like the returning Martin, as played by Depardieu.  His talent at facial expression is wonderful.  The courtroom scene is his best - check out the look he gives the wife as she steps forward to select the correct Martin.</p>
