<h1>Kirikou and the Sorceress (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a little village somewhere in Africa, a boy named Kirikou is born. But he's not a normal boy, because he knows what he wants very well. Also he already can speak and walk. His mother tells him how an evil sorceress has dried up their spring and devoured all males of the village except of one. Hence little Kirikou decides, he will accompany the last warrior to the sorceress. Due to his intrepidity he may be the last hope of the village.</p>
<p>In a troubled African village, an unusual baby is born.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a wonderful movie that should be watched by adults AND children together.  The story is perfect metaphor (in the tradition of many fairy tales) for the situation of many African nations and yet is enjoyable as a story in and of itself.  The "parental alert" is absurd, though.  I would hate for parents to prevent their children from viewing this movie because many of the characters appear partially or wholly nude, as people are traditionally "dressed" in warm/hot regions of the world.</p>
