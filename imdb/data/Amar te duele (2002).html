<h1>Amar te duele (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Renata is a young high-class girl and Ulises is a poor guy. They both fall in love, but they must fight against everyone, specially Renata's rich parents, who want to stop their love by sending her to Canada. The story remarks the difference between social classes in Mexico City, and their characters risk everything just to save their love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So it's a Romeo and Juliet type movie only it has to do with class differences and color In Mexico, there is much racism and hate against dark and poor people but these two young lovers do not care. They fight against all odds to continue their relationship but this all ends in tragedy. Cute guys! Great actors and lots of fun too! Most of the youth in this movie began acting careers as children. I recommend this movie as well as others like Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas, Amores Perros and Ladies Night although this last one is more like a "chick flick" because there are male strippers, a bachelorette party, many guys and lots of fun! The others are great though!NONA</p>
