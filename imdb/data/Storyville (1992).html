<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Storyville", from the outside looking in, is a poorly directed novel adaptation with Spader as a southern lawyer from a wealthy family - the only person in the film with no southern accent - who is running for Congress in the midst of a potentially damning scandal and murder mystery which he must overcome to win the House seat and purge the skeletons from his family's closet. Supposed to have been one of those steamy/sweaty New Orleans noir dramas where everyone knows evereyone else's business and they all have secrets, this film is a jambalaya of murder, sex, deceit, corruption, a couple of babes, courtroom drama, assorted strange/weird characters, token T&A, and even the kitchen sink in a sloppily concocted B-flick with little potential beyond a late night t.v. soporific. Watch this with a nightcap and you won't remember it in the morning. (C)</p>
