<h1>Fire on the Amazon (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Bolivia's Amazon basin, corporate cattle ranches are replacing the rain forest. When Santos, charismatic leader of the union of rubber tappers, forges an alliance with Indians to protest deforestation, he is assassinated. O'Brien, a US photo-journalist who has no skills as an investigator, wants a story when he thinks the police have framed and murdered an innocent Indian as the assassin. In his search for the truth, he involves Lysa Rothman, who worked for Santos and with whom he falls in love. As he gets deeper into trouble with the cops and the real assassin, he not only needs Lysa's help but that of the Indians' leader. How many will die so O'Brien can get his story?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a joke....not the type of movie I would have expected for Sandra Bullock.  The mazazine journalist is angry and swearing constantly which is not normal for anyone (even low lifes).  The movie was very poorly written and directed....totals waste of time.</p>
