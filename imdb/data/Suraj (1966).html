<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, this has a tremendous colour on a par with ye olde Hollywood Technicolor. Also with splendid production values, atmospheric photography and plot, albeit rather familiar.Hundreds of years ago a king makes an enemy of his servant, who in revenge swaps his own infant boy for that of the king and teaches him to be a bandit, while his son is brought up as the dashing prince. The dashing prince is foredained to marry the beautiful princess Vyjayanthimala, who also apparently enjoys swapping places with her servant which leads to dark consequences. Guess whom she fancies? Correct, she can instinctively tell the innate aristocratic breeding of the bandit's son and the hopeless boorishness of the king's. It's a bit more complicated than that of course but enjoyable fun all the same. In 2013 UK BBC Asian Network listeners voted the main song Baharon Phool Barsao sung by Rafi as their favourite Bollywood song of all time, I wouldn't dispute that - it's a gorgeously romantic few minutes in the moonlight with flower petals raining down. And I always liked the equally vibrant Dekho Mera Dil Machal Gaya and Titli Udi both sung by Sharda here.Johnny Walker was a little more subdued than usual, except in colour. Vyjayanthimala was exquisite to look at as usual, except I excuse her brazen dancing. Rajendra Kumar was as dignified as usual, except he was no Errol Flynn. If you decide to watch it prepare to be dazzled!</p>
