<h1>Tuff Turf (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At the start of his senior year in high school, Morgan's father has lost his company, so the family moves from Connecticut, where they've been in the yacht club, to an apartment in the San Fernando Valley. Morgan has grown up in the shadow of his high-achieving older brother, and he seems to have a knack for getting into trouble. He also has a stubborn streak, so when he finds himself attracted to Frankie, the girlfriend of the leader of a local gang of youthful thugs, he can't stop himself from pushing her for a relationship. The thug thinks of Frankie as his property and sees the cool, urbane Morgan as dead meat. Is this a struggle to the death?</p>
<p>The new kid in school must battle a gang of street toughs after stealing the gang leader's girl.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tuff Turf has everything a teen action flick should have. A great first conflict between the bully and his prey, the bully being set up, a great sex scene and a final showdown. James Spader is great in the lead, Kim Richards has  a killer body and Robert Downy Jr . finds great comic relief.</p>
