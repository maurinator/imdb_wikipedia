<h1>Attention bandits! (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the day Jean Gabin dies, a kidnaper who also takes a fortune in jewels heisted from Cartiers murders Simon Verini's wife. (Simon was fencing the jewels for a youthful gang who robbed Cartiers; he suspects them of the murder.) He's framed for the theft and spends ten years in prison, writing to his daughter, Marie-Sophie, who's 11 when he's sent away. Released, he reconnects to Marie-Sophie and to the young thieves, seeks revenge, and is quickly arrested again. She doesn't know what to make of her father, retreats to her Swiss fianc√©, and is flummoxed when one of the young thieves falls for her. Is resolution possible when crime cuts across families and romance?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And therefore, says Jean Yann's character, they can't make gangster flicks anymore. Except that Claude Lelouch can, in his own, slow, deliberate, quirky way. He introduces you to the principals over the course of ten years and punctuates the movie with all the set pieces except for the big robbery: that happens before the start of the picture and sets off the entire course of events, including a double murder, a lesson on the ethnology of Brazil, betrayal, an exclusive girl's school in Switzerland, the funniest prison escape in the history of the movies -- be sure to read the stickers -- and, of course, an equestrian competition. An amazing mix of genres that keeps moving right along.</p>
