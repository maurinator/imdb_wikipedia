<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I heard a bunch of scuttlebutt about The Glimmerman, none of it was true. I heard that Seagal was 'beefing' up for the part and that Wayans was in a real serious role, all this crap! I went and saw it with all in mind and I really could care less at someone else's take on it anymore. Sitting watching the film, I got into the characters, I don't know about anyone else, but I believe thats what it's all about. No Keenan was not totally serious in fact he was mostly comedic, although there were moments of serious but it was not over the top, as I had previously been told. So really, I was going in with a lot of expectations. In all fairness I can say this one was a fun and furious ride (at times). The surrounding cast including Mr. Smith an agency 'spook' employer for the C.I.A. (Brian Cox) was low-level emotion and cynically-balanced. He made the dark side more interesting along with (Bob Gunton) Mr. Deverell and (John) his right arm man, that executes hits and reckon clean-up. In L.A. where I used to live it was fun seeing the old stomping ground, where they filmed it.. Interesting premise of a thriller-story on top of it all. Christopher, the hit-man added a 'whispful' and fatalistic element to the program, played by actor Stephen Tobolowski, he plays psychotic intensely well. Thumbs up!! This was very pleasing for me, I admit you disconnect your reality beliefs with some of it as movies go these days, and some are so much more unbelievable than this. I say this is one of Seagal's greats along with Keenan as an awesome partner in crime-clean up, they stole the show. I recommend for interesting 'plot' twisted stories with good, good casting and interesting characters/scenery.Recommended highly (****)Thx--IMDb.com</p>
