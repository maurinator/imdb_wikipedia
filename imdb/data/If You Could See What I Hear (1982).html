<h1>If You Could See What I Hear (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Sullivan is in many ways a typical student attending a Boston area college, he, showing his immaturity, partaking in, often leading, mainly harmless student hijinks with his pipe smoking friend, Will Sly. He funnels many of his energies into his music as a singer/pianist. Tom also happens to be blind, which he's been since a newborn due to being provided too much oxygen while in an incubator. Tom is independently minded, and wants to be treated just like any sighted person. Like most men his age, he is also in the pursuit of the opposite sex, in the process of which he finds that he falls in love easily. Through all these activities, Tom is affected by real life including the temporariness of college life, some not being able to get over their own prejudices of being sighted in their dealings with him, and coming to the realization that there are some things more difficult to do in life when one is blind.</p>
<p>A light comedy/love story based on the life of blind musician Tom Sullivan.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am also one who watched this movie multiple times when it ran on cable in the 80's...It is one of my favorites. I have never understood why it was skewered by critics. In one of my Video Guides it was actually given a turkey (meaning that they thought it was so bad that it didn't even deserve a rating using the star system!). I have the book that the movie was based on. But I actually enjoy the movie more. Marc Singer is wonderful as Tom Sullivan...All of the actors were good in this film, the story is uplifting and I still enjoy watching it. For those looking for it on video...check out Ebay and half.com :) :)LightByGrace</p>
