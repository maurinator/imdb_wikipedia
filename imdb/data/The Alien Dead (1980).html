<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A meteor strikes a houseboat in the swamps near a southern town populated by Yankees with fake accents. The people on the houseboat become zombies who feed on the alligators in the swamp. Once they run out of alligators, they start going for the citizens. A local scientist tries to figure out what's happening to people once they start disappearing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, this movie could be the very definition of low budget movie.  The film quality sucks, the make-up makes the zombies in "Hell of the Living Dead" look oscar worthy, and at times it seems the movie is just one random scene after another.  Still though, it was funny to watch and it is really short so it is over before you know it.  How this movie got a special dvd release is beyond me when much better horror movies are a lot harder to find.  This movie has a town infested with badly made up zombies that seem to suck blood and in other scenes seem to just want to kill.  The story itself had potential, but the result on the screen is very low budget.  Not a lot of gore, but there is some nudity to see in a rather pointless scene.  The end is a bit abrupt too as nothing is really resolved at all.  The zombies are also not very consistant as they can withstand gunfire, but a comb takes one of them out.  Still though I have seen worse and it is a good movie to make fun of.</p>
