<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In New York City, Susan Weinblatt and Anne Munroe are longtime roommates and friends. Susan is a struggling photographer who wants to get out of the wedding and bar mitzvah racket, those jobs which she primarily gets through her friend, Rabbi Gold, to selling the photographs she wants to take, but she realizes that she has to pay the rent. Anne is an aspiring poet and academic who looks to Susan as her primary guidance. As they move into a new apartment, Anne drops the news that she will not be moving in as she is getting married to her boyfriend, Martin. This news is bittersweet for Susan who is somewhat happy for her friend, but isn't sure if she likes all that Martin now represents to her. Both Susan and Anne will have to make professional and personal adjustments to their new situations, especially in what it means for not having the other as a constant in each their lives. While Anne has a "Martin", Susan has no one currently to replace all that Anne has been in her life. So Susan goes through a series of new professional and personal relationships all in trying to find her way, while the two of them have to decide how and if to maintain their friendship in light of all these changes.</p>
<p>A photographer and her girlfriend are roommates. She is stuck with small-change shooting jobs and dreams of success. When her roommate decides to get married and leave, she feels hurt and has to learn how to deal with living alone.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am so happy that I set my VCR to record this movie back in '96 (or'97) because it hasn't aired on TV since then...at least not here in NY it hasn't. This movie basically follows the friendship of two women in their 20's, living in New York during the late 70's (not the 80's). When one of the women decides to marry a man she barely knows, the other feels abandon and goes on a journey of self-discovery. "Girlfriends" is both funny and depressing, but depressing in a good way (if that makes any sense). I won't go into any further details about this movie. I will say this, though, if you're lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of this movie, watch it and you'll find yourself watching it again and again. I've lost count on how many times I've watched it. Yes, the movie is that enjoyable. I like it.</p>
