<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this movie is rated low just because its a comedy. If you check all the movies are comedies rated low (especially Eddie Murphys). Eddie Murphys is an actor who plays amazing and funny in many good movies. This comedy movie is goodÂ  for the whole family and very fun to see it t in a family movie night. If you choose not to see this movie because of its rating then you make a big mistake (believe me it's not a waste of time).its music is great. and you will enjoy watching it. I loved this movie sow match i watched it like about four times. this movie is good for all ages and don't be afraid to show it to your kids because its just fine.</p>
