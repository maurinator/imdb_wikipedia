<p>I actually had a VHS copy of this play when it appeared on TV. It was loaned to a daughter who tossed it out! I would love to find a video or DVD of this. Has anyone attempted to contact Mr. Thomas to see if maybe he has access to any copies? There MUST be a copy in an archive someplace. HBO does not list this play. Has anyone tried to contact them? The actors were amazing. Barbara Barrie was brilliant and her comedic talent shined. Bess Armstrong's character played beautifully and related so well to the other actors. No one actor tried to steal the show but they all were a team in getting the best performances out of each other. This is one of Neil Simons's best plays. The later version of it with Mr. Redford just did not hit the bullseye for me. I think that anyone who had seen the Thoms version was spoiled. For me to remember all the actors' names is a tribute to their performances. This treasure should not be forgotten and should be resurrected.</p>
