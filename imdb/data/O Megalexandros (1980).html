<h1>O Megalexandros (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on some historical events, the film gives a romanticized biography of Theodoros Kolokotronis, a Greek historical hero serving as a metaphor for Greece herself. Based on a circular view of history, the film presents conflicting ideologies - primitive communism, anarchism, chiefdom or kingdom, personality cult - and shows the institutions of property and power in a bad light.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whilst being both the most visually and audibly haunting Angelopoulos film, I will remember it more so for covering most of the thematic concerns of Angelopoulos in his 40 years of film making:The troubling foreign involvement in Greek political and culturalaffairs The failure of the Greek government to respond effectively to thecrises presented before it The rise and fall of the communistic ideal and the cult ofpersonality The burdens of the historical past upon individuals in the presentThe deconstruction of the foreigner as savior (Oedipus, St. George,Kolokotronis, Jesus, Alexander) The personal cost of living amidst contested geographic, politicaland moral borders Journeying as a metaphor for the search for meaning The nihilism in modernity and the struggle to forge a new way forwardIt's not his clearest or most coherent film, and probably shouldn't be watched until one is familiar with 'smaller' Angelopoulos pieces, but it is the film that resonates with me the most after having seen his body of work.</p>
