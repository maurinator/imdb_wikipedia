<p>Fearing she will die, a physicist's wife hopes her husband will be consoled by the orphan she adopts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maybe not as good as Sentimental Journey - 1946, but then I've never seen the original. I did enjoy watching The Gift Of Love, if only for little Hitty (Evelyn Rudie). She was so adorable and I've always liked Lauren Bacall and Robert Stack. I don't think this movie was at all bad, as some have purported it to be. It was the 50s and movies were like that. B movie or not, it's certainly better than the garbage you see today. Just look at all the remakes of many movies today; they're all terribly done. I can't help being partial to classics and old movies because I was a child in the 50s. Some of my favorite moments were watching these movies. Unlike today's TV fare, you could always expect to watch something entertaining, and without all of the foul language, sexual content, etc. that you generally see today.</p>
