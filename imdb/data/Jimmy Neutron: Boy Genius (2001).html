<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'll admit it-when this arrived in theaters four years ago, I wasn't interested. I was thirteen, "too old and mature" for kiddie pictures. I had seen what Nick had done with their movies in the past and couldn't believe some smart kid picture with the usual fare of gross jokes could be remotely entertaining. I also refused to watch the T.V. series. That it, until I caught an episode one afternoon and realized what an entertainment gem I was missing. The plot of JN is fairly simple- Jimmy is a ten year old genius who wants nothing more than to hang out with his friends and fix the wiring on his shrink ray. However, his inventions cause chaos and his parents want him around for a few more years-restricting him from going out late. Easy enough, but we learn that earlier Jimmy made alien contact, and now the aliens have abducted all of the Earth's parents. Sure, it's a party for a day or so, but soon its up to Jimmy, Carl, Cindy, Sheen, and Libby to save the day.To risk sounding like a clich√©d robot, the genius of the film is in the unique characters. Carl, Jimmy's best friend is a llama-loving dunce while Sheen is "Ultra-Lord" obsessed-an EXCELLENT parody on the fan boy generation. Of course, the best character interaction is between Jimmy and his nemesis Cindy-the second smartest kid in school. Cindy's a tough girl who's hard on him simply for being what he is-a geeky smart guy who's got a slight reputation for knowing it all. Yet, when Jimmy's self-esteem fails, he'll only believe Cindy to tell him what a great guy he really is.I'm sure you've noticed the recent trend in cartoons for adults over the years. Jimmy is no exception, tossing in the mandatory kiddie fare with some sharp references and unique character play. Movie fans may hold Shrek as their holy grail of animated comedy, but in my opinion, Jimmy Neutron can more than stand up to the jolly green giant. In conclusion, don't miss Jimmy Neutron simply because its a Nickelodeon kid's movie. This film is smart and funny with more than enough intelligence for everyone.</p>
