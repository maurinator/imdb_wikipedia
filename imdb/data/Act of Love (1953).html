<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am amazed, and wonder why this movie is unavailable. I would love to get a copy, in any format, as I would be happy to see it over and over. I have not felt this way about many movie in my life. Over the years I have looked for it but always forgot the correct name. It did make a lasting impression on me as a young man.Does anyone know if this movie will become available soon? As the movie ends I wondered what would become of Teller, how would he move on? The poignancy of his dilemma has always come into my mind with a reading of Shakespeare's sonnets. Especially: How heavy do journey on the way When what I seek, my weary travel's end, Doth teach that ease and that repose to say," Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend." The beast that bears me,tired with my woe Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed, being made from thee. The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, Which heavily he answers with a groan, More sharp to me than spurring to his side; For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind. That is how Teller must have felt as he was shipped out to separate him from his love. His return to France after the war, his encounter with the officer who thought he had done him a favor,the wallpaper; all heartbreaking. Do not miss this movie- it can change one's life.As I said above, I cannot understand why this movie languishes in obscurity and wonder if anyone can provide an answer. I can only imagine some contractual problem must exist that does not allow this movies to be mass marketed like many of the other Kirk Douglas masterpieces.</p>
