<h1>Alsino and the Condor (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alsino, a boy of 10 or 12, lives with his grandmother in a remote area of Nicaragua. He's engulfed in the war between rebels and government troops when a US advisor orders the army to open a staging area by the boy's hamlet. Alsino tries to be a child, climbing trees with a girl, looking through his grandfather's trunk of mementos and trying to fly; he goes to town to sell a saddle, has his first drink and is taken to a brothel. But the war surrounds him. The US advisor takes Alsino on a chopper flight, but he's unimpressed. The soldiers' cruelties awake rebel sympathies in Alsino, and after an army assault backfires, the lad is fully baptized into the conflict.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alsin y el Condor was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The camera work was horrible, and the lighting made the movie worse. The simbolism and the point of the movie were illustrated well, but it didn't have a chance due to the poor quality of the tecnical aspects of production.The story is about a boy caught in the middle of a civil war. American intervention becomes a complicated issue, and in the end causes the boy to choose a side- the guerilas. In this movie the boy discovers who he is, while the country is also searching for its identity. Overall, this movie was okay. Better lighting may have kept some people from falling asleep.</p>
