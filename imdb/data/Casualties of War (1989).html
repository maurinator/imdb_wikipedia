The fifth soldier is determined that justice will be done. The film is more about the realities of war, rather than this single event.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although I was supposed to join the ranks of soldiers who went to kill or be killed in Vietnam, I was able to slide out of it. Years later this movie was released and whenever I saw it, something inside of me stirred and eventually those stirrings compelled me to travel to Vietnam which I did for the first time in 1999. I was so moved by some of what I saw there and what I experienced that I wound up making 7 round trip flights from West Palm Beach Fla, to Saigon Vietnam and ultimately moved to Vietnam on a full time basis in 2000 and stayed for a couple of years. Had it not been for Michael J Fox and this movie providing that stirring inside my guts, I may have never gone and unanswered questions about Vietnam and the Vietnamese people may have never been answered. I thank everyone involved in this heart wrenching movie for that.</p>
