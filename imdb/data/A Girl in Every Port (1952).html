<h1>A Girl in Every Port (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After two sailors are conned into buying a lame race-horse, they go ashore to sort out the problem, but when they realize that the horse is one of a pair of identical twins, their plan for revenge becomes more complicated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Groucho Marx and William Bendix deserve much better material than what they are given here.  A bad script with unfunny jokes gives these two talents nothing to work with.  Why they ever agreed to do this film is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood!</p>
