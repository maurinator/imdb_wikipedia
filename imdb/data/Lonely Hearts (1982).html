<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie nearly twenty years ago now, and I'm still wishing that I had a copy.I'm not going to say much about the plot, because it's actually a very simple one.  Two slightly older, slightly less than attractive people begin to have feelings for each other.  Both have difficulties in social situations, and neither has a lot of experience with dating or with interacting with members of the opposite sex.  The movie is kind of a duet of romantic motion: forward, backward, a mis-step, a detour away from the path to a relationship, treated with great sensitivity and affection for the main characters.I wish more people knew about this film.  It was such a refreshing contrast to the usual formula of two gorgeous people eyeing each other across a room and instantly having an affair. Hollywood does what Hollywood does.  Lonely Hearts shows us a slice of life.</p>
