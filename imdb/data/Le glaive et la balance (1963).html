<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The plot of this film is so good, that so many years after when people start talking about interesting films I keep on telling it. Tony Perkins, Jean Claude Brialy and Renato Salvatori were quite famous stars in 1963, and here they are three playboy types in the Riviera who would wear what was fashionable at that time, if my memory does not fail me, a long sleeved dark polo shirt, and light colored jeans. When a boy is kidnapped and murdered the police can see two men wearing this outfit but finally when they find them, three men come out dressed alike. One of them is innocent, but who? Through flashbacks the film tells their different stories, where each one relates how he saw the others conspiring.</p>
