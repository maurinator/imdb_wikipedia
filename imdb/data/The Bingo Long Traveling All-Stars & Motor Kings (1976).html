<h1>The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tired of the slave-like treatment of his team's owner, charismatic star Negro League pitcher Bingo Long takes to the road with his band of barnstormers through the small towns of the Midwest in the 1930's.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Highly entertaining film about a renegade black  baseball team that breaks through barriers in 1939, when black ball players where shunned out of white  controlled leagues. Williams stands out as their razzle-dazzle leader. The almost black cast that also features Jones, Pryor and Tony Burton are  superb.</p>
