<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After a well succeeded heist of many jewels, including some black diamonds, Fait (DMX) is chased by special Taiwan agent Su (Jet Li) and by the Taiwan criminal Ling (Marl Dacascos). They both wants the black diamonds back, having opposite intentions. Meanwhile, the stones are stolen from Fait by the Afro-American criminal Jump Chambers (Chi McBride).  Ling kidnaps Fait's nine years old daughter Vanessa trying to exchange the diamonds for her. Fait and Su join forces to fight against both gangs. This movie is one of those which the viewer shall not think about the flaws in the story. The attractions are the action scenes, with explosions, fights, car chases etc.  The problem is the humor is missing in this film: Jet Li is not funny like, for example, Jackie Chan and the same happens with DMX, when comparing for example, with Chris Rock. Therefore, the movie becomes `too serious' for its proposal.  In `Cradle 2 The Grave', Tom Arnold is the funniest character. `Lethal Weapon' and `Rush Hour' are good example of successful action movies. Anyway, fans of this genre will probably like this film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `Contra o Tempo' (Â‘Against the Time')</p>
