<h1>El Norte (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mayan Indian peasants, tired of being thought of as nothing more than "brazos fuertes" ("strong arms", i.e., manual laborers) and organizing in an effort to improve their lot in life, are discovered by the Guatemalan army. After the army destroys their village and family, a brother and sister, teenagers who just barely escaped the massacre, decide they must flee to "El Norte" ("the North", i.e., the USA). After receiving clandestine help from friends and humorous advice from a veteran immigrant on strategies for traveling through Mexico, they make their way by truck, bus and other means to Los Angeles, where they try to make a new life as young, and undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Peasants escaping mindless labor and a murderous Guatemalan government head to America in hopes for something better.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a beautiful, powerful and endearing film  that Gregory Nava has given the general film  watching public. While few people have ever  seen this film, it rates as one of the best films  ever in regards to Latin American cinema.  Sure, the budgetary constraints can be seen  in many parts of this film, but the overall artistic  stamp of the film more than makes up for the  lack thereof. In our current society of anti-immigration,one has to experience the pain and torment  some of the people have to experience just to  get the chance to live in America. This spirit  alone gives me respect for most working  immigrants, even if some are illegal. Even 20  years from now, Latin American film courses  will still use this film as one of its finest examples.</p>
