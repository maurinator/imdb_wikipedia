<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film that shows how a simple lie can unravel the lives of everyone around it. Shirley MacClaine truly captures the pain of unrequited love. The directing of the film brings intimately close with the characters. We see Audrey Hepburn like we've never seen her before, calm cool and collected a far cry from Holly Golightly. The child who plays Mary Tilford is truly evil quite an excellent little drama queen. Her grandmother also plays an excellent role we truly feel for her when she realises her mistakes. We feel her pain. This film shows how what we build up life can be so easily destroyed and it shows society's prejudiced against love. A definite must see for the powerful acting.</p>
