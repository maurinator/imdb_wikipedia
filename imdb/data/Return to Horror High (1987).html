<h1>Return to Horror High (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A few years ago, a mysterious serial-killer caused panic on Crippen High School. The killer was never caught. A movie company, Cosmic Pictures, has decided to make a feature movie about these events - on location, at the now abandoned school. Since members of cast and crew disappear without a trace, it seems as if history is repeating itself...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Of course this movie is typically 80's horror/slasher cheese. But it's still a fun film to watch... I didn't think it was that bad!Things of course could have been better, maybe a MTV Fear style movie, with the kids/or adults on their own, and going through the abandoned school... I still give this movie 8 1/2 stars out of 10.</p>
