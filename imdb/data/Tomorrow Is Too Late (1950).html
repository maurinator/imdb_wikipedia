<h1>Tomorrow Is Too Late (1950)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie won the Best Italian Film Film prize at Venice in 1950 and had the biggest New York opening for any Italian film up to LA DOLCE VITA. It opened at the large Loew's State Theatre in Times Square, unheard of for a foreign-language film. The movie is about the near-tragedy that occurs when a teenage girl,the lovely Pier Angeli (Anna Maria Pierangeli) and her puppy-love for a boy her own age (Gino Leurini) are misunderstood. Sentimental and very tame by today's standards, it nevertheless has great warmth and appeal. Vittorio De Sica is superb as a liberal and dignified teacher who tells his students the facts of life. Lois Maxwell is another teacher that shares her colleague's views, while Gabrielle Dorziat is a harsh and restrictive summer-camp headmistress ready to suppress any young romance. The fetching musical score is by Alessandro Cicognini, who scored all of the great films De Sica made as a director.</p>
