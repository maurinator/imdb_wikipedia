<h1>The Stars Fell on Henrietta (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The setting is early America during the oil boom. An elderly, down on his luck 'oil man', Mr. Cox finds himself in the town of Henrietta. Using unconventional methods, he convinces himself and local Don Day that there is oil on Day's land. The financially strapped Day puts everything into finding oil...but at what cost?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Robert Duvall is a man on a quest. He is a true believer in his skills at finding oil, and will go to any means to achieve his dream of bringing in the "big one", assault and theft included. His character, Mr. Cox, is somewhat "shady", but likable. Look for Billy Bob Thornton in a supporting role as an oil rig workman. Like any true dreamer, the hunt is what it is all about, and so it is not surprising that Mr. Cox moves on to his next challenge, rather than basking in his hard earned glory. "The Stars Fell on Henrietta" is solid entertainment, especially for anyone who dreams of trying the impossible. Highly recommended - MERK</p>
