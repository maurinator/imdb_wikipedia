<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Orphaned lives a poor lifestyle in Central India and makes living singing songs. One day he comes to the assistance of an injured man, and before he knows it, he is abducted and held by a band of bandits, who believe that he is an undercover policeman. The man he assisted is none other than Sardar, the bandit's leader, who treats him like a honored guest, and eventually his daughter, Kammo, and Raju fall in love with each other. Kammo convinces Raju that they are socialists and are just making sure that wealth is equally distributed. Then Raju is asked to accompany the bandits to a wedding feast where he witnesses a child, and the wedded couple getting killed. He figures that he has had enough and goes to the Police, who decide to confront and kill the bandits. Unable to see their deaths, Raju goes to warn the bandits, but is shunned. Than a militant bandit named Raka kills the Sardar, takes over the bandits and decides to forcibly wed Kammo. The question is what can Raju do under these circumstances?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'd rate this as one of my favorite Raj Kapoor films, even though he didn't direct it, right up there with Shree 420. I like the music a lot, especially, the drumming and percussion. The dancing is pretty fun too, particularly when Padmini and Chanchal are jumping around together. I also liked the water ballet sequence, when the women are leaping into the the pool. This movie had a number of the elements I appreciate in a Raj Kapoor film, besides the music: the river symbolism is well-developed,and Raj plays one of his trademark simple, good-hearted tramps who prevail despite the odds -- without TOO much melodrama (which I don't care for.) I tend to prefer earlier films, both from Raj Kapoor specifically and from Bollywood in general -- from the sixties on they get too westernized for my taste, and the dacoit setting here places the story squarely in Indian territory. I also liked Padmini's spunky energy, and her repeated exclamation "Hoi hoi hoi!" (whatever that means, I'd like to know,) it really got stuck in my head!</p>
