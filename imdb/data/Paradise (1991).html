<h1>Paradise (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson (at the time married to each other) play Lily and Ben Reed, a young couple torn apart by a family tragedy. It would take a miracle to rekindle their love and a miracle arrives in the form of a summer guest - Willard Young played by Elijah Wood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember Siskel & Ebert giving this film a thumbs down.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it, and how moved I was by the story.  Don & Melanie are wonderful together.  A bit slow moving in the story department but more than makes up for it with emotion and heart.</p>
