<h1>Son of the Bride (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At age 42, Rafael Belvedere is having a crisis. He lives in the shadow of his father, he feels guilty about rarely visiting his aging mother, his ex-wife says he doesn't spend enough time with their daughter and he has yet to make a commitment to his girlfriend. At his lowest point, a minor heart attack reunites him with Juan Carlos, a childhood friend, who helps Rafael to reconstruct his past and look at the present in new ways.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great performers in an expertly mounted A feature. This one goes on too long but deserves to edge out the glossy English speaking movies which play to the same audience in the multiplexes.The film is full of great players given the chance to do their stuff. Darin has the authority of a major leading man and it's a great pleasure to see already familiar veterans like Alterio and Aleandro in strong roles. Her spin on senility is a beautifully judged mix of touching and funny that the film needs to grab the broad public. Verbeke registers as an exceptionally vivid version of the sexy, winning fantasy girl that we keep on seeing in films. If you want to argue that these characters are a distortion of real life you're in a different mind set to the makers and the fourteen dollars a seat customers they are playing to. I enjoyed seeing this recognisable world of cell 'phones, old friends, resolved family tensions and gourmet food put across in an unfamiliar setting with superior film know how. It's like a good overseas holiday. The old Sascha Guitry gag of the security system picture or the finding the priest at the final wedding were worth the cheer they got at the performance I saw.</p>
