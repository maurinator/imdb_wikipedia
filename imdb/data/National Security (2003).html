<h1>National Security (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Earl and Hank have only one thing in common: they're both L.A.P.D. rejects. One just got kicked out, the other can't even get in. After confronting each other on opposite sides of the law during a traffic stop that escalates out of control, these two luckless individuals end up partnered as lowly security guards. Despite being damned to the lowest rung of the law enforcement ladder, Earl and Hank uncover a sophisticated smuggling operation led by Nash and his band of thugs. When Earl and Hank get their hands on some hot property, they go on the run from, first the bad guys, then the L.A.P.D.--led by Lt. Washington and Detective McDuff. What these two unlikely partners do to law enforcement is a crime, but they just might save the day. That is, if they don't kill each other first.</p>
<p>Two mismatched security guards are thrown together to bust a smuggling operation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie had me rolling hard the first 15 minutes or so. Great pairing of Martin Lawrence as a wanna-be cop with Steven Zahn's character as an ex cop on the hunt for his first partner's killer. Hold on a minute, I know what you're thinking. "Another cop movie with the, oh so, unoriginal sub-plot about a cop trying to find the killer of his partner." Yeah, well you're right. Definitely nothing original. However, the way in which Martin and Zahn end up partners is highly unconventional, and very funny stuff. Forget about the rest of the plot, their partnership is what drives National Security. Action-packed with an excellent pace throughout, National Security will keep you engaged from start to finish. I was laughing all the way through; however, the racists jokes by Martin get old after the first act. If anything diminishes this from being a flawless, carefree comedy/action film, the constant black vs. white humor would do it. Otherwise, great movie for a cold, lazy Friday night.</p>
