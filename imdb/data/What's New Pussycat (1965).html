<h1>What's New Pussycat (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Michael James, a notorious womanizer, desperately wants to be faithful to his fiancée Carole, but runs into serious problems since every woman he meets seems to fall in love with him. His psychoanalyst Dr. Fassbender can't help him either since he's busy courting one of his patients who in turn longs for Michael. A catastrophe appears on the horizon as all the characters check into the Chateau Chantelle hotel for the weekend not knowing of each other's presence.</p>
<p>Michael James, the British editor of a Paris fashion magazine, is in love with ESL teacher Carole Werner, but despite Carole and her parents' want for them to get married, Michael just isn't ready to give up his womanizing ways for Carole. In Michael's own words, he has been cursed all his life by "looking almost handsome when the light shines on him in a certain way" and thus becomes the object of desire for most women who see him in that light, such as unbalanced exotic dancer Liz Bien and a parachutist named Rita. Michael is seeing Austrian therapist Dr. Fritz Fassbender to help him with his problem, unaware that Dr. Fassbender will probably be of little help as he secretly aspires to Michael's life. Despite being married, Dr. Fassbender most specifically lusts after one of his patients, Renée Lefebvre, who only has eyes for another. Because Michael won't give her a commitment, Carole takes up with Michael's neurotic friend, Victor, who in turn truly loves her despite also aspiring to be more like Michael. All their romantic entanglements come to a head as they all convene - some by accident, some on purpose - on the Chateau Chantel for the weekend.</p>
<p>A playboy who refuses to give up his hedonistic lifestyle to settle down and marry his true love seeks help from a demented psychoanalyst who is having romantic problems of his own.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"What's New Pussycat? (1965) was directed by a British director, Clive Donner and it is the first feature film for which Woody Allen wrote the original screenplay. Allen also played a supporting role of Victor Skakapopulis, the friend of Michael James (Peter O'Toole). Michael is a fashion editor, surrounded by beauty and glamor of his models which he can't refuse. He truly loves his fiancée Carole (Romy Schneider) and wants to be faithful to her but what can a man do if the gorgeous women literally fell for him from the sky? He sees a psychoanalyst Dr. Fassbender (Peter Sellers) who is not much of help and faces his own demons. Meanwhile, Victor is desperately in love with his best friend's fiancée...The movie reminds a lot "Casino Royale" - it was made in the 60s, has a great cast (Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress), strikingly beautiful women and the song by Burt Bacharach. It takes place in Paris - and it is almost as much mess as "Casino... " is - silly, naive, and often simply ridiculous but somehow it works after all these years. One of the reasons I believe is Allen's script, the dialogs and one-liners that are hilarious. This time, Allen received more screen time that in Casino.... and he made his scenes very funny. "What's New Pussycat?" is not a great movie but it is charming and I like it.6.5/10</p>
