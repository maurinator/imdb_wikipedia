<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny.Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are.The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning.To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on.Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project.Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.</p>
