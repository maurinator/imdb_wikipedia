<h1>Mr. Nice Guy (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A hitman by the name of Mr. Nice Guy is about to be married and his fiancee doesn't know his true profession. On top of that, his future father-in-law has a contract out on him. A zany mafia comedy!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm willing to bet that the low rating of this film on the IMDB is due to it getting confused with the Jackie Chan move of the same name: Yatgo ho yan (1997). This movie, starring Mike Macdonald, is actually pretty funny, and I wonder how it did not make it to the mainstream, and also makes me wonder why Mike Macdonald couldn't find success in Canada other than the Juste Pur Rire festival in Montreal, and the flop of Misquito Lake (which I wish I could see even though everything I hear of it is horrible).This movie is good for those who like Leslie Neilson or Lloydd Bridges movies.</p>
