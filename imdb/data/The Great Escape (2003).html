<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One word great. I am saying its a great game because as compared to games coming out in 2003 this game had a unique feel. The movie sequences were well staged in the game, the graphics were good too for a 2003 game. The missions on airfield, tunnel, train were freaking awesome rest missions were cool too. The sound track is pretty good tunes from movie itself. Especially the bike mission in the end is one of the best stages I have ever played.The game-play is pretty cool you can do loads of stuff. Weapons are good, AI is good too. A great RPG. A must play for all the gamers out there. Should play this if you are a true gamer. You will love it.</p>
