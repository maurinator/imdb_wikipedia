<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Three Girls and the Golden Cocoon" ...Released (2005)... This Movie is among the first few which depicts the Bodo Culture like The exotic Indi silk with golden color cocoon found only in Bodoland area of Assam(India). I give 10/10 for its effort. More Movies of such kind should be appreciated. There is so much to be told about the Bodo Culture. "Three Girls and the Golden Cocoon" is a beautiful amalgamation of west meeting the remote east of India. The culture and the traditions are beautifully depicted. He did an awesome job as a one man army as a Director, Producer and Writer. The cast of Onjaali Bodosa, Natalie Roth, Brandee Tucker did a great job. My Best Wishes to Mr. J.Bodosaand his team for his future endeavors. All the Best and Good luck..</p>
