<h1>Whale Music (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shot around the breathtaking coastline of B.C.'s Howe Sound, Whale Music is the triumphant adaptation of Paul Quarringaton's Governor General's Award-winning novel about the redemption of a faded rock star through love and music. Richard J. Lewis' exploration of the reclusive musician's efforts to create a piece of music that will summon the whales is a sensory and emotional tour de force.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If your main interest in film is the exploration of character, "Whale Music" has something to offer you. And you'd better like that, because it's all that's on show here. The script is certainly meandering, and a little bit aimless. It takes a real long time to get anywhere, and when it does, you might question if the journey was worth it. But the actors are good. Maury Chaykin and Cynthia Preston work believably together. Chaykin, especially, has a convincing internal struggle.I suspect a braver film could have eliminated the secondary characters and amped up the issues and delusions and emotions of Chaykin's character. There's enough here to make a worthwhile film, but you get the sense that more could have been achieved with the material provided.</p>
