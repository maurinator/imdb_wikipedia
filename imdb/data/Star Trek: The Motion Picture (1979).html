<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Spoilers Ahead:This film is not slow; this film is like geological time. It felt like several years long. When I waited in line for hours, in 1979, after Paramount acted like it was the second coming, you had a whole lot of angry people. By the time the film was over, the theater was half empty. Some people were asleep, I am not exaggerating. Long shots of every possible angle of a poorly glued, crappy model. Do you blame them? I really like Alan Dean Foster; this is the man who wrote ALIEN. Let's look at this great script; an intelligence way ahead of us and it cannot tell scans from weapons attacks? It only thinks sentience is machine based on its travels through the universe it never encountered organic intelligence? Its ignorance of organic life is so profound, it needs to hijack a bald woman and remake her as a mechanical probe? It thinks a cheap piece of junk some monkey boys sent into space is like it is? Was Alan on medication when he wrote this?The acting, even for Star Trek, is just awful. This film was legendarily bad; the studio went nuts and rushed Wrath of Khan out as fast as they could, they even used the effects scenes from this movie. If you watch carefully, in Wrath of Khan, you can see the scenes they lifted right out of this. They had no choice; the Trekkie's had a baby when this came out. It is so slow, boring and poorly written. Wise made my favorite movie: The Sand Pebbles, what happened Bob? It is the worst film made in the entire 1970s; nothing even comes close. We are the Creator? In your dreams, pathetic humanists. Oh, how they loved saying those words every humanist's dream to be God. They killed off theirs, they believe, and their quest is to make themselves God. Yes, this hyper intelligence never knew you made that piece of junk and needs to bow down before you. I am going to vomit. Trust me, you do not need to know the esoteric plot; it is the most boring movie you will ever watch. I filled a room with 12 people; within a half hour everyone but me and my best friend were sound asleep. Robert Wise never made another Trek movie for a reason young people; when this was released people were really, really angry. The first 45 minutes, nothing and I mean nothing happens. Bring a pillow and an alarm clock, you will need them.</p>
