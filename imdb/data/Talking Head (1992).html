<h1>Talking Head (1992)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Weird, surreal, funny and at the same time creepy. Some may find it boring, but Talking Head provides lots of "brain food" about motion pictures in general, while retaining a surreal haze around itself.Anime - and Oshii - fans will find lots of sequences that has been reused in later productions, like Avalon. And after watching this, some Hideaki Anno's Evangelion scenes suddenly doesn't seem that groundbreaking anymore.If you are an anime fan and can tolerate a lot of weirdness, it's definitely a must. Just don't expect anything to make *real* sense.</p>
