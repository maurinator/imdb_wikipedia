<h1>Restless Natives (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two lads in Edinburgh embark on a non-violent spree of robberies. They dress up in clown masks and act as modern highwaymen, robbing coach loads of tourists in the highlands. In the process they become folk heroes to the locals. Their adventures make for a whimsical and gentle comedy, in the Bill Forsyth vein.</p>
<p>Two Scottish friends become local folk heroes and tourist attractions when they start holding up tour buses with novelty items.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Please post if you find this film on sale...or if you can find the rights to it. I'm desperate to sign it up and resell it on DVD.This is one of my favourite films of all time. I have looked high and low for a copy. I now find myself in the position of head of acquisitions at a film distributor...and I'm really looking for the film owner. If you are the owner or know who it is please let me know. I'd love to get this out on sale again as I love it, but also I think it's an undiscovred treat for the rest of the world that never saw it.CheersNeil</p>
