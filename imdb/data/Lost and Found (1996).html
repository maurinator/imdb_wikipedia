<h1>Lost and Found (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mitch and Caroline rescue a Vietnamese émigré who falls off a fishing pier and gets amnesia. Mitch then investigates and tries to find the Amerasian's father, a former Vietnam veteran-now a weather beaten fisherman, to talk to the amnesia girl. Meanwhile, C.J. meets a developmentally disabled, wheelchair bound man, named Jess, who's a comedian-wannabe who wants wheelchair access to the beach and she gets Cody, now working part-time at a bicycle shop (as a result of a sprained hand), to help Jess out.</p>
