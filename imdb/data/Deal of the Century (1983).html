<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The overall plot of this movie is weak however there are A LOT of memorable scenes.  These scenes make me watch this movie a couple times a year. This movie has a similar tone to Caddyshack, Head Office, Fletch, etc.  I think it's one of Chevy's better performances.  His narration in the movie helps add to the overall comical tone.If you are at all a Chevy Chase fan and enjoy his older work (Caddyshack, Fletch, etc.) this is definitely worth renting.</p>
