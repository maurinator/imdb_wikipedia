Cisco tries, but it's complicated by Sue's disappointment that he's dealing again, the unannounced arrival of Jesse (Cisco's old singing partner) strung out on heroine and a recent divorce, and a drug sale that almost ends in a bust. Can Cisco avoid a new arrest, make the sales, get the money to Leo, and maintain his self respect?</p>
<p>A down on his luck former drug dealer is forced by a corrupt LAPD policeman to sell 100 keys of confiscated marijuana in one weekend.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was barely seen in 1972 starring Kristofferson and Gene Hackman as a scumbag cop.  Harry Dean Stanton is marvelous as Kris' friend and Karen Black is always interesting.  The cute Joy Bang is even here.  This film was so far under the radar, most people forgot it even exists.A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Harry Dean Stanton.  Hackman should have played more characters like this one.  This may be Kristofferson's best work (as an actor) along with Blume in Love.  Great cinematography and location work.  I can't believe this wasn't a hit in 1972.  Track this one down and you won't be disappointed. There was plenty of "junk" in the golden age 70's, but this film should not be included.</p>
