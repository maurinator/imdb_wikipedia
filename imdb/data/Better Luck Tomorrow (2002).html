<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Formulaic MTv script with some Asian stereotypes thrown in. The thing about stereotypes is that positives ones dehumanize just as much as the negatives ones. The only funny bit about this movie are the many plot parallels with Boyz n the Hood. almost fell on my ass laughing when I heard the comment about the dead body. I don't know if they are intentional, or just another symptom of the lack of imagination. I wouldn't support films like this with my money. There are better film about Asian American lives out there. After making billions with stereotypes of black Americans, some MTv executives must've thought they could try the formula with the Asian community.</p>
