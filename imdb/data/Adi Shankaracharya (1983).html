<h1>Adi Shankaracharya (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The first and only Indian movie to be made in Sanskrit. The movie follows the life and times of Sankara - the founder of the non-duality (Advaita) school of Indian philosophy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Its a very well shot movie with the scenes mostly speaking for themselves, although the dialogues are great in Sanskrit. Shri GV Iyer definitely must've understood the advaita philosophy well to do such a fantabulous job. Moreover, the director has kept the events that had varied opinions (that is, where not everyone agrees on what exactly happened then) left to interpretation in most cases.The acting of each individual is praiseworthy. The Vedic recitation has been captured well, and in these modern years, one of the most difficult jobs of bringing in age-old authenticity to the geography has been achieved without doubt.The movie brings an amazing calm with it and takes you at a different level with each scene, also making you want to see more of GV Iyer's works. Sadly, he passed away before finishing his work on Ramayana.</p>
