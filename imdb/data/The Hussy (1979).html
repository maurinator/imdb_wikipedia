<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A strong analogy with William Wyler's masterful "the collector" (1965).But "la drôlesse" is a good movie on its own,probably Jacques Doillon's finest hour.François,a hung-up young man,locks up Madeleine ,a teenage girl ,in an attic.François is an outcast,unable to integrate well into a society. Here begins a "in Camera" drama ,with a subtle development.Soon ,we do not know anymore who the prisoner is and who the jailer is.An inhibited person,François is completely baffled when Madeleine tells him that she wants to be pregnant by him.As some critics noticed when the movie was released ,the keyword is "games".The two characters seem to play dad and daughter ,dad and mom ,and so on....Madeleine Desdevises,who was very promising,died from leukemia shortly afterwards.</p>
