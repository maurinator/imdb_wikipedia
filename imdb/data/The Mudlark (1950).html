<h1>The Mudlark (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1875 London, young Wheeler (who lives by scavenging) finds a cameo of Queen Victoria which he thinks so beautiful he risks his life to save it. Possessed of a desire to see the Queen, he slips past the Beefeaters and wanders about Windsor Castle, just when a state dinner is in preparation. Meanwhile, prime minister Disraeli is struggling hard to persuade the Queen to end her long seclusion</p>
<p>"Mudlarks" are street children who subsist by scavenging on the banks of the River Thames. An orphan named Wheeler discovers a medallion of Queen Victoria. An older friend explains that "she is the mother of all England," and Wheeler promptly sets out to meet her. But Victoria has shut herself away in her palace for the last thirteen years, in mourning for her dead husband. Wheeler's misadventures in the palace coincide with Disraeli's attempts to convince her to end her seclusion. Amazing performance by Irene Dunne.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Quite an under-stated classic with some superb film-noir scenes shot on the river-bank. Mudlarks, scavengers for anything at all on the Thames' tidal mud-banks, were only one of the Victorian under-class of homeless, often orphan kids forced to scratch a living, some-how, or die without raising an eye-brow in the great metropolis. This film tells how one of these poor kids attempts to see "The Mother of the Country". Andrew Ray, who plays 'Wheeler' died in 2003. The rest of the cast can never quite out-act the young lad though Findlay Currie as the boozy, kind and understanding John Brown comes close.</p>
