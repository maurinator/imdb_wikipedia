<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is to me one of the best none English/German movies ever seen. I can't really comment on Director or any other visual elements in the movie because it has been quite a while since I have seen it, what I can remember very clearly though is the characters. Although the predecessor of my comment states that the characters were not very real (and this is a rather valid point) I do not think that that is a negative thing. I think it is almost beautiful, almost comic how frank, cruelly honest they are. See, this is what makes this movie so very good, it's different, original, and because of it's obvious or even fake superficial and still rather insightful characters. It's almost comic. This movie really is worth watching, but only if you can see the beautiful in what seems to be the flawed.I recommend this movie to anyone who'd like to see something a little different.</p>
