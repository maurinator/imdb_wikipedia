This goes along quite well until one night a burglar named Raoul breaks in and cuts himself in for a piece of the action.</p>

But things take a turn for the worst when people become untrustworthy leaving one of them for dead.</p>
<p>A relatively boring Los Angeles couple discover a bizarre, if not murderous way to get funding for opening a restaurant.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the greatest comedies ever made (right up there with National Lampoon's Vacation, Caddyshack, Dumb and Dumber, and Clerks) that really makes a strong statement about swingers, s&m, rape, murder, and cannibalism without becoming tasteless. This is Bartel's greatest accomplishment. A major cult hit and deservingly so.* * * *</p>
