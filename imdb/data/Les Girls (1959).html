<p>Rancher J. Brodie contracts Paladin to deliver three mail order brides to his home in Oregon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Someone has been hijacking shipments of mail-order brides meant for men in Oregon. So Palladin is hired to deliver three attractive French mail order brides--Yvonne (Helene Stanley); Annette (Danielle De Metz) and Cecile (Roxanne Berard) to the Brodie family. They are chaperoned by Madam Chalon (Mabel Albertson). Along the way, Palladin teaches them the ways of the west and how they will be expected to work as part of a western family. Essentially a comedy episode, somebody did a nice job of casting the three lovely mail order brides. They are all very attractive. Roxanne Berard returned to the series in two more episodes as another character, Rivka Shotness in 1960 and 1961, while Danielle DeMetz appeared in Sam Rolfe's two "U.N.C.L.E." series. Mabel Albertson is quite familiar to audiences as the mother of Darren Stevens on "Bewitched", the mother of Donald Hollinger on "That Girl" and the mother of Laura Petrie on "The Dick Van Dyke Show". However, in none of those shows was she ever saddled with a accent, and if you watch this, you'll see why. Not exactly convincing.As a story, this one is kind of light and fluffy. Sit back and enjoy it for the cheesecake.</p>
