<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This episode marked the return of Alexandra Cabot to the ranks of the living after she gives up witness protection to help prosecute the man who nearly killed her. Stephanie March for challenging the machismo of a Columbian drug dealer was nearly killed in a previous episode and it was thought to let her stay dead for her own safety.But a new investigation involving a brokerage house laundering drug money with multiple victims ties into her case. The same man did the deeds as ballistics confirm.Which by the way is the main weakness of the episode. Any professional hit man would have dumped his weapon and not signed his name to the work. But that's how the squad aided by narcotics detective Nicholas Gonzalez catches Brian O'Byrne who is a coldblooded piece of blarney.The IRA bred and trained a lot like him and when the troubles in Ireland abated, guys like O'Byrne were looking for work. This one misses on killing a child and he's the only living witness.What could have been a better episode is flawed by not paying attention to detail.</p>
