<h1>Jason and the Argonauts (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jason has been prophesied to take the throne of Thessaly. When he saves Pelias from drowning, but does not recognize him as the man who had earlier killed his father, Pelias tells Jason to travel to Colchis to find the Golden Fleece. Jason follows his advice and assembles a sailing crew of the finest men in Greece, including Hercules. They are under the protection of Hera, queen of the gods. Their voyage is replete with battles against harpies, a giant bronze Talos, a hydra, and an animated skeleton army, all brought to life by the special effects wizardry of Ray Harryhausen.</p>
<p>After a 20 year voyage, Jason (Armstrong) returns to the Kingdom of Thessaly to claim his throne. But it's not quite easy for this. In order to gain the throne, he must find the magical Golden Fleece, which has amazing healing powers. He selects a crew, which included Polydeuces (Crawford) and Hercules (Green). Jason also gains the help of the Queen of the Gods, Hera (Blackman). Jason and his crew must now reach the fleece and survive the likes of a 100 foot bronze giant, a huge venomous creature with head full of seven snakes, and a terrifying army of skeletons.</p>
<p>The legendary Greek hero leads a team of intrepid adventurers in a perilous quest for the legendary Golden Fleece.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What do I like about this movie...besides Harryhausin's special effects? Besides the frenetic battle with the skeletons and the seemingly hopeless fight against the statue of Talos? I like the way the people are presented, I suppose...Heracles is presented, not as a young ripped body builder, but as one would expect a middle-aged strong man to be: Formidable, a little grey and a little swaggering. Argos, the ship builder, is tan and fat, as one would expect the veteran of many sea voyages to be. The crew looks like what one would expect a crew of ancient greeks to look like.The acting is not spectacular, but sincere. No one looks embarrassed to be in this movie. It is tight with great special effects...wonderful for children...And, I must mention Hera, normally portrayed as a matronly and vindictive woman, is here presented as a beautiful and helpful goddess by Honor Blackman, no less. Although many of you may be more familiar with her as Pussy Galore from Goldfinger...</p>
