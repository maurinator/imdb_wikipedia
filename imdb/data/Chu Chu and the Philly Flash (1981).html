<h1>Chu Chu and the Philly Flash (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Flash used to be a talented baseball player, but he took to drinking and now he sells stolen watches in the streets. One day he meets Chu Chu, who, before falling into alcoholism like him, was a successful entertainer. Now she still dances, but in the streets, for no more than a cent or two. Luck seems to smile at them the day they find stolen government documents forgotten some place. They decide to return them to their legal owners, but instead of the expected reward money, all they get is a load of trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alan Arkin is a bum, surrounded by characters crazier than himself, who has finally dried out and has the chance to play minor league ball. (He was known as the "Philly Flash" when he was a major league pitcher, before becoming a major drunk.) The only catch is, he's got to get there(Minnestoa as I recall) himself. So he does all the things street people do, wash car windshields, do small errands, sell bogus crap to people to get the bus ticket money. He has friends and colleagues, but not the kind that will finance him (Hey,we're talking $40 here) So he's trying to earn the bus ticket money.Enter, Chu Chu (Carol Burnett) a street performer who teaches music to the desperately untalented from her one room apartment and does a very funny one woman band show for spare change on the street. When they meet, its love at first sight, okay, maybe second second. Although the main comedy instrument is the discovery of secret government documents, which the Flash informs Chu Chu are worth "fifty bucks, maybe seventy five", this movie is about the love between two hapless characters who's talents aren't enough for fame and fortune but gives them the hope that they can have a better life than the ones they have.What makes this film really work is that their best friends sitting in the bus depot basically recalling the events of the last few days while waiting for their friends to arrive. If Chu Chu and the Flash are life's losers, then Charlie (played by Adam Arkin) and Theresa are a few rungs below that. Everyone should have friends as loyal and selfless as these two.</p>
