<h1>Stripes (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Spots and stripes are great camouflage for creatures. They help them blend into their environments. When Chris, Martin and Zoboo see striped and spotted creatures (tiger cub, serval cats, Dalmatian puppies, coati babies, a skunk), they get inspired to paint Animal Junction in spots and stripes. Zoboo takes that inspiration a step further when he paints spots on Martin and stripes on Chris. He also paints himself with spots and stripes, and the gang learns about being a camouflaged creature. Jackie says that milkweed plants may look like weeds, but they're home for striped monarch caterpillars, so please don't pick them. In Zobooland, Zoboo meets Boogle, who's sitting in a zoot fruit tree eating its fruit. The zoot is messy and drips all over Boogle, giving him spots. Those spots are good camouflage, so when Boogle says hello to Sally Mander, she can't see him. Zoboo and Boogle swim, so that Boogle can wash his spots off and be seen by his friends again.</p>
