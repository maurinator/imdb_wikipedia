<h1>CB4 (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A "rockumentary", covering the rise to fame of MC Gusto, Stab Master Arson, and Dead Mike: members of the rap group "CB4". We soon learn that these three are not what they seem and don't apear to know as much about rap music as they claim... but a lack of musical ability in an artist never hurts sales, does it? You've just got to play the part of a rap star...</p>
<p>Albert Brown and his buddies Rip and Otis are aspiring rappers who have tried every gimmick to break into the music business. Eventually, Albert and the boys decide to go into gangster rap, with Albert assuming the identity of M.C. Gusto (a local crime lord who is serving time in prison). Eventually, Gusto finds out about the boys scheme and seeks revenge as well as a share of the profits.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is an amusing highly quotable, high energy attack on the hypocrisy of rap music. It is a mock documentary in the style of Spinal Tap and uses the format extremely well.Although the characters often descend into caricatures, the energetic performances from Chris Rock, Allen Payne and a great spot from Willard E Pugh as Don King baiting record label boss, Trustuss Jones, see this film through.Great Soundtrack and comic songs such as Sweat On My Balls and Straight Outta Locash are excellent. I would recommend this film to anybody with an hour and a half to spare.</p>
