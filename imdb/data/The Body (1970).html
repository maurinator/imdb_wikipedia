<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A woman's body is found with no identification on it. Friday and Gannon must try to identify her and their only clue is an unique ring she had on.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not the most exciting case I've seen on "Dragnet" as the detectives spend the entire episode trying to identify a 'Jane Doe' body that washed up along the pier in Venice Beach. The coroner isn't able to identify who the body is, as it's pretty battered but this appears to be a case of suicide--not murder. Gannon and Friday check through all the recent missing person reports that might correspond to the dead girl but with no luck. On an off chance, they try identifying a ring worn by the lady but it, too, appears to be a dead end. What will they do next? This is one of the more depressing episodes, not only because a young lady is dead but once they find out more about her and why she did this it all just seems like such a waste. While you probably won't need a Kleenex to watch this one, it won't leave you feeling great. Sad...very sad.</p>
