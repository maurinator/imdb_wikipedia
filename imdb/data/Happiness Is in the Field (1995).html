<h1>Happiness Is in the Field (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Francis, the boss of a small plumbing supply company, is harassed by tax collectors, striking employees, and an impossible wife and daughter. His only joy is sharing lunch with his friend Gerard. Then a TV show called "where are you?" shows a woman from Gers who is searching for her husband who disappeared 28 years ago. The lost husband looks like an identical twin of Francis...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The plot of "Le Bonheur est dans le pre" is a simple one, but the excellent casting, the finesse of tone and dialogues, the constant humour give this movie real class.The ending is a happy one, but by no means what one usually calls a "happy ending" (these words imply for me a certain amount of 'schmalz' and stupidity, which lBedlP definitely doesn't have !). It makes the viewer feel refreshed and well, content with a few aspects of the world he's living in.It's a modern fairy tale, worth seeing again and again (especially when you feel a bit depressed, or slowed down), an apology of the simple (and free) pleasures of life.Some might remember the 'Safrane' as one of the highlights of the movie, I prefer the one remark made by Cantona: "C'est pas lourd le confit !"</p>
