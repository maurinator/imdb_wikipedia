<h1>Wonder Boys (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Grady Tripp is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor pregnant. In the meantime, he and a college student, James Leer are trying to find a rare jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, and a college girl, Hannah Green boarding with Grady has a bit of a crush on him.</p>
<p>On the day his third wife leaves him and his literary agent arrives to pressure him to finish a novel seven years in the writing, Carnegie Mellon professor, Grady Tripp, also learns that his married mistress is pregnant. Seven years before, with his first novel, he was a wonder boy. So was his agent. Both now need something. Over the weekend, instead of making choices, he vacillates in a pot-induced haze. One of his students, James Leer, perhaps stirs paternal feelings in Grady and raises homo-erotic urges in the agent. Academic politics complicate things: Grady's mistress is the college chancellor, her husband chairs Grady's department, James has just shot the husband's dog. What to do?</p>
<p>An English Professor tries to deal with his wife leaving him, the arrival of his editor who has been waiting for his book for seven years, and the various problems that his friends and associates involve him in.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I truly enjoyed this film.  I went into the theater not knowing much about it; perhaps that had something to do with the reason I liked it so much.  I found this film to be extremely witty and entertaining.  I found myself intrigued by each character, especially the dark, mysterious James Leer (Tobey Maguire).  It has been a while since I have sat in a theater merely enjoying a movie.  The storyline was rather odd, but kept my interest.  The students in the film had a quite casual relationship with their professors. All in all, I can say that each actor gave a wonderful performance; and if you are looking to see a film that upon leaving the theater will make you feel happy and disturbed, then this is the film.</p>
