<h1>Hideous Kinky (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hideous Kinky is the story of two sisters (seven and five years old) traveling with their hippie mother from London to Morocco. They encounter many adventures, new experiences, and interesting culture as they tag along on their mother's search for freedom and love. It is told through the eyes of the youngest girl, and we learn her observations on life, Mum, and determined sister, Bea.</p>
<p>An Englishwoman travels to Morocco with her two young daughters, where they deal with and adjust to the culture and people of the area. Told from the perspective of the youngest daughter, the story provides insight into the Moroccan atmosphere. Based on a 1992 novel by Esther Freud.</p>
<p>Hideous Kinky is set in a time about 30 years ago when it was not uncommon for young British free-thinkers to cross into the next continent with virtually nothing in their pockets. They left their proper schooling and part-time jobs behind to make their trek into a poor, desert country in Africa in search of themselves and their spirituality. And so this story begins with a young English hippie woman who has brought her two young daughters with her on her journey. Though the book is narrated by the youngest of the two daughters, it is not yet clear that this is so in the screenplay version of Hideous Kinky.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kate Winslet is almost director-proof. She, the girls who play her daughters and the photography are the best things about this meandering tale of an upper-middle class, twittish young mother dragging her two daughters around Morrocco in 1972. She apparently wants to find something spiritual, but is very half hearted in her search for it. Things do happen, but almost none of the potential character, spiritual or cultural conflict is interestingly explored -if at all. The punches are constantly pulled when it comes to emotional confrontation. A typical scene is where a Christian teacher tries to steal one of Kate's daughters. Kate confronts the woman, and we assume we will now see what our heroine is really made of. But no: the confrontation takes place behind a closed door! There are some nice moments and some very clunky ones.(Some of the kids' dialogue was especially woeful). However, it's hats off to the photography, which is utterly gorgeous.</p>
