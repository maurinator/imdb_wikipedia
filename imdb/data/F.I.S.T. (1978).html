<h1>F.I.S.T. (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Johnny Kovak joins the Teamsters trade-union in a local chapter in the 1930s and works his way up in the organization. As he climbs higher and higher his methods become more ruthless and finally senator Madison starts a campaign to find the truth about the alleged connections with the Mob.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For the most part, this is a good, solid (pseudo)biography of a charismatic labor leader, but towards the end it runs out of steam and loses the clarity and effectiveness of the early sequences. Still, it's worth seeing, with Stallone getting one of his most atypical roles and handling it satisfyingly.   (**1/2)</p>
