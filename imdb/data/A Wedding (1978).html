<h1>A Wedding (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Muffin's wedding to Dino Corelli is to be a big affair. Except the aging priest isn't too sure of the ceremony, only the families actually turn up as the Corelli Italian connection is suspect, security guards watch the gifts rather over-zealously, and Dino's grandma expires in bed just as the reception starts. Could be quite an occasion.</p>
<p>The daughter of a Louisville truck driver marries the scion of a very wealthy family, but reception at the family estate is boycotted by the invited guests.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fascinating comedy from Robert Altman's peak periodbefore his 80's downslide. A Wedding is sadly underappreciated,and really deserves to be rediscovered, especially after the recentsuccess of Gosford Park which is an obvious companion piece tothis film. Both films deal with class and gender distinctions andfeature an eccentric group of party-goers who can't seem to leavethe soiree and are trapped in a mansion (obviously inspired byBuenel's Exterminating Angel). A Wedding is filled with greatperformances especially Carol Burnett, who is the heart of the film;Geraldine Chaplin; Desi Arnaz Jr.; and Mia Farrow. Highlyrecommended.</p>
