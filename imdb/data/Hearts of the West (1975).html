<h1>Hearts of the West (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lewis Tater writes Wild West dime novels and dreams of actually becoming a cowboy. When he goes west to find his dream he finds himself in possession of the loot box of two crooks who tried to rob him. During his escape, Lewis stumbles on to the set of a Wild West movie and through mishap and chance becomes a star of Hollywood Westerns.</p>
<p>1933. Iowa hayseed Lewis Tater wants to be the next Zane Grey, doing whatever needed to get his western novel published and to be a better western writer. As such, he enrolls in a correspondence writing course with the University of Titan which he learned about from a magazine ad. He decides to head to Titan, Nevada to soak in the western atmosphere and to attend the classes in person, he not realizing that the university does not exist and that it is all a scam. In Titan, he, by chance, stumbles across Hollywood-based Tumbleweed Productions' latest filming locale, they who specialize in B-westerns. Tumbleweed studio head Bert Kessler hires Lewis, who needs a job to live, to be among the stable of stock "cowboys" appearing in his movies. As enthusiastic but naive Lewis works his way through his new-found movie career while still clinging to the notion of getting his novel published, he changes his role model from Grey to Billy Pueblo, who was not only a famed western writer but also a star in B-westerns before he supposedly retired from both careers to live on a weasel farm in Montana. Lewis is assisted in navigating through his Hollywood life primarily by two people: Howard Pike, the lead stock cowboy in Tumbleweed's movies, he who is also seen as an expert in all things culturally western; and "Troutie" - Miss Trout - Kessler's production manager, who is attracted to Lewis, and he to her. Lewis also has to steer clear of the con artists behind the University of Titan, they who are after him because of an incident that occurred before Lewis left Titan, and who only know that Lewis has headed to Hollywood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a likable farm galoot Jeff Bridges makes. His Lewis Tater wants to be a Western writer and by golly neither pursuing crooks, nor double-crossing buddies, nor phony correspondence schools are going to stop him. Like his literary alter-ego The Kid, he's just too eager to get discouraged. Across burning deserts and thundering hoofs, he soldiers on toward fame and fortune and Hollywood and Vine.And what a hoot his purple prose is. Like an amiable Walter Mitty, minor events get spun into major events for "The Kid" in such deathless passages as, "Twirling, The Kid fired with all he had into the phantom riders", or " A Colt in either hand, he scattered lead at the retreating dust." What a great sleeper movie this is, thanks to the comical Bridges and some unerring light touches. Take for example the cheap Western they're filming. Catch how a groaning Lewis steps on the big romantic clinch, or how his curtain-chewing death throes put the director (Arkin) into a murderous tizzy. But I especially like that awkward little turn on the sidewalk where he brushes against the potted palm and wins the affection of Miss Trout (Danner).The movie's also a telling look at the making of matin√©e Westerns, a staple of kids' viewing in the 1930's and 40's. As a former Front Row kid, I viewed those parts with mixed emotions. I guess I still want those guys to be real cowboys and not the shrewd businessmen-actors they likely were.Anyhow, in my little book, this is a little gem from beginning to end, with scarcely a misstep along the way. It never ceases to amaze me that the Hollywood-bred Bridges (his dad was veteran actor Lloyd Bridges) can play such a convincing hayseed, but he can. Speaking of hayseeds, watch for a very unMayberry Andy Griffith, again showing what a fine, versatile actor he is. I'm just sorry this style of clever low-key comedy has given way to today's frantic bathroom kind. Maybe Hollywood needs to hire more Lewis Tater's, after all.</p>
