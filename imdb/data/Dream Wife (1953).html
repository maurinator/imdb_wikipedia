<h1>Dream Wife (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Clemson Reade, a business tycoon with marriage on his mind, and Effie, a U.S. diplomat, are a modern couple. Unfortunately there seems to be too much business and not enough pleasure on the part of Effie. When Clemson meets Tarji, a princess trained in all the arts of pleasing men, he decides he wants an old fashioned girl. Princess Tarji's father is king of oil-rich Bukistan. Because of the oil situation and to maintain good political relations during the courtship between Clemson & Tarji, the State Department assigns a diplomat to maintain protocol until the wedding. Effie!</p>
<p>American businessman Clemson Reade is feeling a little emasculated by his relationship to his fianc√©e, the emancipated Priscilla Effington - Effie to her friends - who seems more committed to her job with the State Department and maintaining friendly relations with oil rich Middle Eastern countries, such as Bukistan, than marrying Clem. Clem wants a wife that will stay at home and attend to his needs, much like the beautiful Princess Tarji of Bukistan did when he took a recent business trip there. Princess Tarji, like all Bukistanian women, was raised to cater to the needs of the men around her, especially whoever will be her husband. That fact makes Clem come to the realization that Tarji would be the perfect wife. As such, Clem and Effie break up and Clem, through a telegram, proposes to Tarji. She, through her father, the Khan of Bukistan, accepts, which brings into play the State Department to ensure that whatever happens between Clem and Tarji will support the soon to be signed oil agreement with Bukistan the Americans so desperately want and need. The person assigned to the Clem/Tarji file is Effie. Clem and Effie, with Tarji, end up spending more time together than they have in months. In the process, all three come to a realization of what they want personally, which may not mesh with what needs to happen diplomatically.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>American businessman Cary Grant is engaged to diplomat Deborah Kerr but grows tired of her putting her career before their relationship. So he breaks things off and becomes engaged to a Middle-Eastern princess (Betta St. John) who has been taught from birth "how to make a man happy." But the customs of her people (and Kerr's interference) ensure that Grant won't find any happiness with her.Inane romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny. A terrible movie on nearly every level. The characters are very unlikable no matter how hard I tried due to my fondness for the actors. The best thing I can say about this is that I liked the name of Cary's character, Clemson Reade. Cary Grant didn't make many stinkers but he did here. It's one of the worst films in his career. It was so bad Cary considered retiring from acting after this and didn't make another movie for two years. Worth seeing if you're a die-hard fan of the stars or on the slim chance you might find something interesting about the socio-political stuff.</p>
