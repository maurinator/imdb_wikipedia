<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>first of all, this is not a good movie.  however, it has some of the best lines i've ever heard.  and the whole "dead guy as a satire on societal discrimination" was great and probably not easy to do.  if you appreciate the stupid/funny/strange, then this is a good choice.  plus, it has austin pendleton, who just rocks.</p>
