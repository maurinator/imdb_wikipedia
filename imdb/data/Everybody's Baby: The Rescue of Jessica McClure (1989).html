<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this movie when I was about six years old. It had a profound effect on me. The story of Jessica McClure is one that will undoubtedly touch everyone who hears it. Jessica: Everybody's Baby vividly shows the events that took place on October 14, 1987. This is a movie that I'm sure will stay with me always. The movie begins with Jessica playing in the backyard. The majority of the movie is a heart-wrenching journey in which baby Jessica cries out for help while desperate paramedics struggle to rescue her. The emotional reactions of her family are also shown throughout the film. The ending is, in my opinion, the greatest part of the movie. I recommend having some tissues by your side.</p>
