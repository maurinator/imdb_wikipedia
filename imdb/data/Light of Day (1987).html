<h1>Light of Day (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The siblings Patty and Joe Rasnick live in an industrial suburb in Cleveland, Ohio. While Patty is focused on their rock band, The Barbusters, Joe also cares for the family and the upbringing of Patty's young son, Benji. Their pious mother reproaches them for their way of life, especially when they quit their jobs and go on tour, taking Benji with them. However, when their mother is dying of terminal cancer, they return home and resolve their problems with her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this film had an original story and a great script.  Michael J. Fox puts forth a wonderful attempt to make us believe he is Joe Rasnick, aspiring rock performer, and, as always his acting is on the level and heartfelt.  Joan Jett, while trying really hard to play the wild and sometimes estranged sister Patti, just can't seem to find the emotion needed to make her role believable (her musical performance doesn't disappoint, though).  Gena Rowlands, as usual, is superb in her attempt to make us buy her as Joan Jett's  righteous and disapproving mother.  All in all entertaining, yet not quite believable.</p>
