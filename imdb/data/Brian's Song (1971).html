<h1>Brian's Song (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

Although they compete for the same spot on the team, and despite the fact that Sayers is black and Piccolo white, they become roommates on the road and very close friends, especially when Sayers is injured and Piccolo helps his recovery. Later, they and their wives must both deal with the harsh reality of Piccolo's cancer.</p>
<p>Based on the real-life relationship between teammates Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers and the bond established when Piccolo discovers that he is dying.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, I did. Anyone who doesn't the first (and probably second) time they see it is not human. The film does a fantastic job of establishing a strong bond between the two lead characters, played by James Caan and Billy Dee Williams. Then, at the end, when Billy Dee says "I love Brian Piccolo..." I lost it! Blubbering! This is one outstanding film. If you decide to watch it, have your tissues handy towards the end!</p>
