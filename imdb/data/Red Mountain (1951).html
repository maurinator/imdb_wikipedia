<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I always remember when having to choose between 2 films, one of them being John Ford's Rio Grande my father asked the opinion of the shoeshine boy who was polishing his shoes and had seen both. "Don't go to see Rio Grande he said, it is a western but it has only two action scenes, too little for mine or anybody's taste" That was also my opinion at that time, I was 9 years old. If instead I would have gone to see Red Mountain, I would have been in paradise. And I still enjoy this film as if I was a 9 year old. It is not easy to find a western with so much action as this one, but well planned action scenes with a beautiful background, top stars like Ladd, Lizabeth Scott, John Ireland, Arthur Kennedy and a screenplay that incorporates the action scenes in an intelligent way. Ladd who is pro Quantrell saves Arthur Kennedy from being lynched but ends up on a mountain together with Kennedy and his girlfriend Lizabeth Scott surrounded by Quantrell who has a lot of Indians on his side. Good cinematography, good entertainment and a lot of action.</p>
