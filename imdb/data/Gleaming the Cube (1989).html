<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You don't need to be of the 80s generation or an 80s lover to like this movie. I'm 72 and I like it. Christian Slater and his buddies do such a nice job portraying smart but good kids who don't fit into the rigid system. Good for them! So they're middle class and well off, so what. They're loyal to one another and they're not a violent gang.The skateboarding is fantastic.The action chase at the end is a darn good one.The strange thing is that it's a murder story and a detective story, which is why it appears on some neo-noir lists.The movie actually has some soul in its own way.</p>
