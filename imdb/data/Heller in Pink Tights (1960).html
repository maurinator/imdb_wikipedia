<h1>Heller in Pink Tights (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nineteenth century Wyoming: the wild West. Mild-mannered Tom Healy has a two-wagon theater troupe hounded by creditors because Angela, his leading lady and the object of his affection, constantly buys clothes. In Cheyenne, they meet with applause, so they hope to stay awhile: the theater owner likes Angela, and she keeps him on a string. She's also the object of the attentions of Mabry, a gunslinger who's owed money by the richest man in Bonanza. Complications arise and the troupe heads for Bonanza, through hostile Indian territory. Is the troupe doomed to a peripatetic life, is Mabry in danger, and does Tom stand a chance with Angela, a hellion in pink tights?</p>
<p>Story of theatrical troupe that travels through the Old West.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is really very badly directed - which is amazing given Cukor's excellent filmography.  He rarely focuses the attention of the viewer where it should be - and seems obsessed with close-ups on Sophia's eyes.  I wonder if Carlo Ponti interfered a lot here - as Sophia is rarely out of shot, to the detriment of the other characters and the film.  This is one of Sophia's worst performances - she seems to be struggling with her lines - although she looks good blonde.  The excellent supporting cast is wasted - even Anthony Quinn is allowed little screen time.  Eileen Heckhart is allowed even less time, but it's interesting to see child actress Margaret O'Brien in a rare adult role.  Her little girl voice is jarring however.  The only reason to see this film is to witness the final performance of the legendary Ramon Novarro.  He is splendid and stylish as the villain - a great lesson in screen acting, although again we don't see enough of him.  Is there a story about the making of this film?  I wonder if Cukor had to battle the Ponti-Loren partnership and was forced to give too much screen time to Sophia.  What a mistake!</p>
