<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a huge Munsters fan since I was a child, this film doesn't fail to be brilliant - fantastic performances from all cast and very very funny story.Interesting to see the show in colour rather than black and white, however, both black and white and also colour really fit the show/film very well.This is easily the best of the Munsters movies.If you're a HUGE Munsters fan, like me, then you will definitely LOVE this :)It would be brilliant if this film came out in BluRay :)</p>
