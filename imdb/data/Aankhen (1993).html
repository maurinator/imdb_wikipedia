<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When David Dhawan started his career, he had a few ups and downs...well mostly downs. His first 4 films bombed but he gave 2 hits in Shola Aur Shabnam and Bol Radha Bol. However, his first monster hit came in Aankhen.Hasmukh Rai is a very wealthy man but is always upset with his buffoon sons, Munnu and Bunnu. (Chunkey Pandey-Govinda) The boys are good hearted but big troublemakers. They are spoiled brats who see the dark side of life when they witness a shootout. A shootout they have nothing to do with but a shootout that changes their lives.Aankhen is a film that works with an interesting plot but scores due to other things working out more than the plot. The comedy in the first half and parts of the second half is still memorable to me. The chemistry of the two lead actors is first rate. Not to forget their chemistry with Kader Khan. There is even more comedy with a twist in the second half.Also, the sequences featuring a minor love triangle between Kader Khan, Bindu and Saadishiv (Pyare Mohan) is thoroughly enjoyable. Not to forget the double role portions.Flaws? The film does dip in pace a bit in the second half.Music is fantastic. Love all the songs.David Dhawan's direction is excellent. One of his best works.The film belongs to Govinda and Chunkey Pandey. Especially Govinda in the second half. They make Aankhen what it is. Kader Khan is as always, fab! The villains in the movie are awesome. Shakti Kapoor, Gulshan Grover and Raj Babbar are perfect.Rest of the cast is great.Overall - A film that never bores you when its on and one of the David Dhawan's most underrated flicks. Superb!</p>
