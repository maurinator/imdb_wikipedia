<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you liked Army of Darkness... you will want to see this movie!This movie is a comedy, horror, fantasy type similar to "Army of Darkness". House 2 however, has nothing to do with the original release of "House". It is a stand alone movie. Good acting and a creative story line make this well worth  watching!</p>
