<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Castellani let it rip with this one! The movie's a riot 혰 but a thoroughly enjoyable one.Carmela, the daughter of a well-to-do village fireworks manufacturer, relentlessly pursues Antonio, the returned soldier son, now unemployed, of a less than honest poor village woman.Finally, of course love triumphs... but it's a rocky road to get there! Slowly Antonio is wooed 혰 and when he is, he's resolute 혰 but then they face the reluctance of both sets of parents to their match 혰 and Antonio's sister's indiscretion with another wealthy landowner doesn't help.I was exhausted by the end with all the shrieking, weeping, chastising and emotional swinging.The movie is beautifully filmed. Some of the editing is a little rough. The direction improves as the movie goes along. Nino Rota gives us a taste of how his musical gift will develop in subsequent years.</p>
