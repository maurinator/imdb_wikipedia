<h1>Grey Gardens (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Maysles brothers pay visits to Edith Bouvier Beale, nearing 80, and her daughter Edie. Reclusive, the pair live with cats and raccoons in Grey Gardens, a crumbling mansion in East Hampton. Edith is dry and quick-witted - a singer, married but later separated, a member of high society. Edie is voluble, dresses - as she puts it - for combat in tight ensembles that include scarves wrapped around her head. There are hints that Edie came home 24 years before to be cared for rather than to care for her mother. The women address the camera, talking over each other, moving from the present to events years before. They're odd, with flinty affection for each other.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine year old Edith Bouvier Beale and her fifty-six year old daughter, Edith 'Little Edie' Bouvier Beale, are Jacqueline Kennedy's aunt and cousin. Living alone with several cats, fleas and raccoons (the latter, wild, which live in the attic but who Edie feeds), the Beale's are discovered living in filth and squalor in Grey Gardens, their 28-room family mansion located in East Hampton, Long Island, the mansion which doesn't even have running water. Edie moved home twenty-four years earlier to care for her ailing mother. In what Edie considers a "raid" on their privacy, the Suffolk County Board of Health orders the Beale's to clean up the house or be evicted. With few exceptions, the Beale's are suspicious of the outside world. The Beale's comply with the order and renovate the house with financial help from their more famous relative. Mother and daughter are outwardly combative with each other, but their constant bickering masks a protective attitude each has for the other. Both cling to their past lives, with each still believing that that life can exist, Edith as a singer, and Edie as a social débutante (Edie is always sporting a fashionable scarf around her head). Old habits die hard as even two years after renovations on the home have begun, Edith lives primarily in her bedroom in her twin bed which is covered with garbage and cats, who use the corner of the room as a bathroom. And Edie constantly dreams of a time when she can return to living in New York City as a débutante and dancer, although one realizes that she is only using her mother as an excuse for what she really considers her comfortable current living situation.</p>
<p>An old mother and her middle-aged daughter, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, live their eccentric lives in a filthy, decaying mansion in East Hampton.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first time I viewed Grey Gardens, I was as mesmerized as the other people who have written comments.  So many elements of this film are fascinating, there are so many things going on there.  The ultimate passive-aggresive relationship of the mother and daughter.  So co-dependent. One moment Edie is blaming Edith for her loneliness, the next she is about to swim in the ocean and saying out loud how she hopes her mother does not pass on anytime soon, she would miss her.  Yet one has to wonder if Edie really wanted to leave so badly, why didn't she?  Maybe Grey Gardens was where she most wanted to be after all.Edie never leaves the home or rarely sees anyone, yet she still has the rich, white woman's concern over her weight. It is hilarious to see her peering at the scale through binoculars.  When you see pictures of the women as young beauties, it takes your breath away.  Edie is still a beautiful woman, and her coquettish behavior at times makes her seem like a young lady.The language is entirely witty and it is hilarious to see the two women go on and on.  Favorite comments -"France fell but Edie didn't.  Edie never fell for anyone." "Why didn't you marry Getty?"  "I'm a staunch character! S-T-A-U-N-C-H!" "Lost in a sea of green leaves.  I'll never see that scarf again." "This is the revolutionary outfit." "You don't say luh-ove! You're not Czechoslovakian!" "All I need is to find this Libra man!"The cats and racoons are a site to see, as is the faded mansion.  A wonderful window into the world of two  compelling characters, their lives, and their memories. Yes it is at times sad, but at the same time, these two are fabulous!</p>
