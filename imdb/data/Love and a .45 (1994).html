<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some lazy and uninformed Critics and Reviewers can't help themselves and immediately lash out at this Movie's similarity to others Directed by Tarantino, Rodriguez, Stone, and Lynch. Truth of the Matter is that when Films are so near in release dates it is unfair and somewhat inaccurate to claim thievery.It is more likely and a bit Metaphysical that these Creative Folks were all tapping into that Akashic Record thing or what may be called the Hundred Monkey Theory. Whatever. This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride.It is over the top, around the bend, down the rabbit hole and off into outer space. Nutzoid and Naughty, Dirty and Delightful, with a Cast that cries out Cult Movie. It is proudly self-conscious, Violent, and Funny enough for it to become part of the Zeitgeist that was working in its Day and can not be ignored. This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.</p>
