<h1>Down to Earth (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It seems everyone is trying to get into heaven; at least those whose time is up. For Lance Barton, a struggling comedian and bicycle messenger, it's the last thing on his mind. His due date upstairs is 50 years away. In the meantime, he's got big dreams to pursue on Earth, such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though - he ain't that funny. Thanks to an over-cautious emissary from heaven, Mr. Keyes, he's going to get hit (literally) with a much bigger problem. Showing that even God has difficulty finding good help these days, the inept minion mistakenly plucks Lance from a traffic accident - before it takes place. Transporting him to the Pearly Gates, or more accurately, the velvet roped-lines of the hottest club around, the error is finally addressed by Mr. King, the streetwise, no-nonsense head angel who manages the place from his plush windowed office. Since returning to his own body on Earth is impossible, the urban dwelling Lance reluctantly agrees to a normally unthinkable proposal. He'll occupy the body of a wealthy old white mogul, Charles Wellington, until a more suitable body can be found. Strangely enough, in a Park Avenue penthouse, servants and butlers become his new homeys as Lance works on his streetwise comedy routine for the big Apollo showdown. Living in the body of a callous old white man would be bizarre enough for Lance without falling in love with Sontee, the beautiful woman publicly battling Wellington's company at the same time. And if that wasn't enough, he's got to deal with the love affair between Wellington's wife and his personal assistant, and their plot to have him killed. Can reincarnation lead to self discovery, true love and a better stand up routine? Lance Barton is about to find out.</p>
<p>After dying before his time, an aspiring black comic gets a second shot at life - by being placed in the body of a wealthy white businessman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this is one of the only films that i've actually left the cinema because it was so bad.the others were, just in case you're interested, the others were 1:"deep impact" - so boring i had to leave and 2:"dude, where's my car?" - you can only listen to "sweet","dude" for so long. and besides i dislike that guy from "that 70s show". chris rock is a one trick pony, while admittedly that trick can be funny, you cant base an entire film on it. (the whole black vs white thing). i think chris rock needs a partner in his films to rein in his ranting. well that's all i have to say but i'm being forced to finish this 10 lines rule. sorry ......... ............ ........... ............... ........ .......... ...... ......... ......... ........... ......... ...... ....</p>
