<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a lover of all things "Martin & Lewis" if i were forced to choose which movie i enjoy the most from the team - i'd have to say this one. Why? While i understand and adore the gimmick of the team (Dean: the straight man, the romantic crooner, the big brother - Jerry: the "all over the place" monkey, the off key bumbler, the kid.) This movie gives us a chance to see Jerry's "other" talents. Yes, Jerry is a brilliant physical comedian, but ....He can dance! OH YES! There is a scene with him and Sheree North in a very exuberant dance number that i can't help but to rewind and watch several times. it's just an awesome routine! the choreography is excellent! and Jerry moves with straight swag! Also there is a delightful number with him and Dean in top hat and tails whereby Jerry clearly dances better than Dean. However, Dean clearly sings better than Jerry, so it evens out (HA!) that said- there is also a rare opportunity (especially in the Martin and Lewis Days) to hear Jerry sing a song straight up-neat, shaken and not stirred. Just his regular singing voice. (no high pitched shrieking that i adore in spite of itself) although it obviously goes without saying it's not as beautifully crooned as when Dean sings the same song-still It's surprisingly pleasant and shows a hint of what makes Jerry capable of being every bit as romantically appealing as Dean if given the chance to switch it up. At least...it worked for me, and i fell IN LOVE with Jerry after having seen this film for the first time as a kid. It's just a great movie. If you've not seen it..give it a view. Chances are you won't regret it.</p>
