<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A charming remake of "Against All Flags". Doug McClure takes on Errol Flynn's role but this director, as well as the cast have a delightful sense of humor & everyone appears to be having a good time. It's the same movie (almost word for word) but at the same time it's totally different. I hate to admit it but this movie is better than the original. Watching them both in the same day is quite an experience. Two great casts, one fine story yet two different genres.</p>
