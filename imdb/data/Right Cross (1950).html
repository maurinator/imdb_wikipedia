<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A great example of movies made in an era where innocence was valued and innuendo was cleverly used to convey steamier topics which couldn't be given a thorough treatment outright.  Using boxing as a vehicle, the movie deals with fidelity, racism, and the struggle in post WWII USA between those achieving the American Dream and those blocked out by class and ethnicity.But forget all of that - June Allyson is simply beautiful as the strong-willed and spunky daughter of an Irish boxing promoter, and her real-life husband Dick Powell is uniquely sublime playing a "wannabe" beau with alacrity.Great flick - just watch it and look at June's beautiful baby-face.  There just aren't any actresses with those particular beautiful and innocent youthful charms today!</p>
