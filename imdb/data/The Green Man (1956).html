<h1>The Green Man (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Work has been going with a bang for freelance assassin Hawkins but a job in England just after the war is a different matter. His apparently easy target, a pompous government minister, is off for some hanky-panky at the Green Man on the south coast, where Hawkins is planning to retire him for good. But before he can get on with this the hit-man has a procession of unwanted visitors at home to dispose of - one way or another.</p>
<p>When he is not working as a watchmaker, Hawkins is a professional assassin. His current target is pompous industrialist Sir Gregory Upshoot, who he plans to kill at the Green Man hotel. His plans are interrupted by vacuum cleaner salesman William Blake who stumbles onto the plot. When no one in authority believes him, William travels to the Green Man to save Sir Gregory</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great Ealing farce in the Kind Hearts and Coronets murder-comedy stylee, revolving around Sim's hitman (specialising in slapstick bomb-hits) plotting the death of a prominent businessman, and George Cole's vacuum cleaner salesman, out to thwart the killer...Room for plenty of comedy shenanigans as the top cast blunder around leaving clues and confusing each other, building to a climax at the country inn of the title. Thoroughly enjoyable for fans of the genre, with just a little bit of Terry-Thomas thrown in near the end to add his unique suave zest to a very appealing mix. Expect the thrills to come from Sim's eyebrows and laid-back attitude, and Terry-Thomas' 'tache, rather than the plot.</p>
