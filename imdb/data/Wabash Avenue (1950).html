<h2> Summaries </h2>

Unable to win it back, Andy schemes to make Mike's position untenable.

But at the last minute, Andy's revenge comes unravelled.</p>
<p>See the plot of 1943 movie "Coney Island", also with Betty Grable. This is a remake. In fact it's an exact remake. Just change the stars and their names in the picture, other than that it is the same story. It continues the old Hollywood tradition; never make anything new when a remake of an old money maker is much easier.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A quintessential Betty Grable vehicle from her time at the top of the Fox heap. Platinum blonde Betty is working as a flashy dance hall girl in Phil Harris's music emporium when Harris's old rival and sometimes best friend Victor Mature drops in with his stalwart sidekick, and comic relief, Reginald Gardiner. In no time Vic has wheedled his way into co-managing the joint and come to loggerheads with the brassy Betty, who Harris is sweet on, but lickety split he refines her tastes and style at which point the pair fall for each other, Betty's discovered and hits the big time but with many bumps along the way until the completely expected happy ending. Cotton candy fluff is no stretch for any of the performers but Betty's warmth and star power aided by Mature's braggadocio and both Gardiner and Harris's comic playing make it a pleasant diversion. Margaret Hamilton also pops in for a few brief scenes to add zest to the movie.A must for Grable fans.</p>
