<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you have only seen this movie on TV, you have not really seen this movie.  One of the best movie experiences of my life was seeing this movie in the theater with a full house of college students.  I have never heard an audience laugh so hard, and I was laughing with them.  That experience can never be recaptured.  I don't know why this movie doesn't make the midnight movie tour in college towns.  That way it might have some of the same impact.  Also when it came out in 1978 it is hard to explain how big John Belushi was unless you were there and saw it first hand.  It's still funny on the small screen, but only if you see it uncut.  Never watch it on a network, they cut out most of the jokes!</p>
