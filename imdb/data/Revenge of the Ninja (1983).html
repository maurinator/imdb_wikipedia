<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>man this was the greatest ninja movie ever made......it had violence,sex and a hero and a villian that were capable assasins!!!..for the people that say the acting was bad ar there were script problem....the movie was about the action and the entertainment not about winning the dam oscar!!!!!!!...and it was set in salt lake city utah...that alone made it unique because it wasn't the typical filmed in new york or la crap!!..anybody who can't appriciate two ninjas dueling to the death..with those beautiful utah mountains in the backgroud....just doesn't get it!!!</p>
