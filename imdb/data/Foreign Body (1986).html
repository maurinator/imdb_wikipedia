<p>Chronicles of the adventures of Ram Das in England. Ram Das moved to England after losing his job in India.

<p>An unemployed Indian engineer emigrates to England to find work and through a series of circumstances, ends up impersonating a doctor to win the attention of an attractive young woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoy the relationship between Ram and his Uncle I.Q. Uncle is amazing, as a hard worker, dreamer, philosopher and (in this case) schemer for his nephew.Ram gets to England, and gets a government job on a bus. One day, a woman is unconscious. Ram finds her fascinating. He announces himself as a doctor. Suddenly, everyone around him gives him respect, and does whatever he asks. The woman revives, and wants to re-pay the doctor's kindness.Ram's Uncle comes up with a brainstorm: become a doctor (who pretty much just acts like a chiropractor, with a good bed-side manner). The story zooms along.Ram is well-cast, as well as his girlfriend and her mother. Most of the time, the movie goes along slowly, but it is surprisingly tense also. I have watched this movie several times over the last 15 years, and will see it a few more times in the future.</p>
