<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I got this 1970 TV movie on VHS and was so surprised how good it was. The story was great and the acting is at the top. Don Murray plays the marshal of a town called Medalia, who has lost his nerve and his gun skills. When the Jesse James and Cole Younger gangs cut a murderous swath through the land, the citizens brace themselves for an outlaw invasion! It has a great cast including John Saxon, Anne Francis, Harry Dean Stanton, Gene Evans, and Stuart Margolin. In the cast is a very young Harrison Ford who played the part of Carl, the leader of the citizens committee who stops all the strangers that come into the town of Medalia! Harrison was meant to have a very big part as one of the citizens of Medalia, but during a fight scene, he fell on a gun and cut his teeth and was unable to be in the rest of the movie, so he ended up with only one scene. But all in all, this was a very entertaining western for a 1970 made-for-TV movie that should be on DVD or VHS!</p>
