<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Homer Smith (Sidney Poitier) is a stubborn , obstinate ex-soldier when heading himself to the West he stops at a farm in desert . There meets a group of speaking-German nuns from East European Catholic . They are ruled by a stiff Superior Mother called Mary (Lilia Skala) and she thinks Smith has been sent by Christ for the building their church . They'll develop a likable friendship , helping the unfortunate nuns and creating a particular divine mission until the touching ending .It's a fascinating , quiet film , perfectly acted and concerning the narration about the construction a church of riveting manner . Gentle , sympathetic Poitier and the strict Superior nun confront wills each other , but finally learn the meaning of the power of God and ultimately come to respect themselves . The storyline by James Poe relies heavily on the continued relationship among them but it isn't tiring ; being entertained and with numerous diverting moments and agreeable feeling . Enjoyable comedy and laughters are continuous ; the chuckles are based on diverse characters and differences among protagonists , he's Protestant , nuns are Catholics . Biggest of the film are the musical duets between Poitier and the nuns . The movie is well set with nice rural scenarios and is't eventually hampered by racist stereotypes on the black men , neither Mexican people . The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and are treated religious and ethic issues with great sense of fairness and ductility . Ideal cast completed with magnificent actors . Sidney Poitier won a well deserved Oscar . He was the second African-American to win an Academy Award , before won Hattie McDaniel and later will achieve it famous actors as Cuba Gooding , Denzel Washington and Halle Berry . Glamorous and sensational cinematography by Ernest Haller . Moving and phenomenal score by the great Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful blues-songs by Poitier . The motion picture was driven with enormous fair play by director Ralph Nelson (Blue soldier) who followed this with a television movie . This is a wholesome and politically correct family fare . Indispensable seeing for Poitier fans.</p>
