<h1>Microwave Massacre (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Construction worker Donald is having a hard time getting anything good to eat since his wife has decided to only cook gourmet foods. That and her constant harping cause him to snap, and he whacks her. Somewhere in the confusion he comes up with a new use for the microwave oven, and begins to eat much better. Soon he's experimenting with different recipes. And different meats.</p>
<p>Fed up of his wife's bad cooking, Donald kills her and turns to cannibalism to satisfy his appetite.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't say that most movies stick with me as Microwave Massacre has. I gave it a 10, because if an awful movie is that memorable, then it has more than done its job. I only saw it once 20 years ago, but I can still picture much of the movie in my head. I can't enter a butcher shop without the musical number "I'm a big meat eater" running through my mind.I wonder if Jeffrey Dahmler saw this film? Perhaps he was inspired by this film to be a movie maker, but then failed, so he decided to eat people instead. We should support our artists more, to keep the Hitlers of the world away from the front page. If Hitler had only gotten into architecture school, his monstrosities might only have been architectural.I suppose this review is a warning: don't see this movie if you don't want to remember campy, kitschy horror scenes for the rest of your life.</p>
