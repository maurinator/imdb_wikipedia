In Francois's classroom, there are Serge, whose brother has just married to try to escape from the war in Algeria, and Henri, a pied-noir (Algerian-born Frenchman). Francois and Serge will have a homosexual relationship, but Serge wants to marry his brother's wife...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I absolutely adore this movie.  When I first saw it, I loved it because I could identify with the lead gay character, but I have seen it since then, and i love it now for its portrayal of the complexity of adolescence life. This is by no means part of the American teen melodrama genre.  It deals with everything from homosexuality to mental illness to war to racism to feminism to communism.  It has a deep political, psychological, and emotional message.  I urge you to see this movie.</p>
