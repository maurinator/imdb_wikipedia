<h1>Sadhna (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mohan lives a middle-class life with his ailing mother, and works as a college professor. His mother would like him to get married, but he asks her to be patient as he awaits his probationary period to end at the college. At the college he lectures his students about Vasantsena, the evils of prostitution and his personal hatred of courtesans, who sell their lives for money. Things take a turn for the worse, when his mother suddenly collapses, loses consciousness, and is not expected to live long. The only way he can bring peace to his dying mother is to get married. His neighbor, Jeevan Ram, agrees to find a woman who will pose as a wife for a fee, and introduces him to a woman named Rajni, who is then introduced to his mother. His mother's health improves, and she begins to get better day by day, with Rajni visiting her frequently. His mother is so pleased with Rajni that she even gives her the family jewels. Then the mother and son receive the shattering news that Rajni is not who she claims to be - but is actually a prostitute by the name of Champabai - but by then it may be too late to save the family jewels, the lost respect in the community, and a possible relapse to Mohan's mom's health.</p>
