<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In case you've never heard of Marie Ragghianti, she escaped an abusive marriage and went to work for a firm, only to discover some unsavory things about it. In the movie "Marie", Sissy Spacek plays her as well as can be expected. However, I would agree with a previous reviewer that the movie sort of uses her as a conduit to tell the story, and otherwise seems incomplete.But overall, they do a pretty good job showing how Marie was finally able to make something of herself, only to be faced with the dilemma of maintaining this position or blowing the whistle. Maybe not exactly a masterpiece, but certainly worth seeing. Also starring Jeff Daniels and Morgan Freeman.</p>
