<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Because it is from India, it makes up for the really bad cgi horrible rip off of Gulliver's travels and lots of roars. Not worth the price I paid. It was a rip off. Even the kids wont enjoy this one. I bought it in China for a dollar. I want my dollar back. The only benefit is being able to mock it mystery science theater 3000 style. I didn't think it was possible to find a movie worse than cabin boy, but this is it. It is two hours of my life that I want back... But then again, if I were drunk this might actually be funny. It does have it's random rock video moments. The mermaid is just ridiculous. You could blind someone with that beard! The plot from power rangers would be considered advanced compared to this.</p>
