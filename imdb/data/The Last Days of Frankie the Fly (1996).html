<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Is this a great movie? No. Is it a bad movie? No.Michael Madsen and his henchmen are the mob guys you love to hate.  Daryl Hannah is very believable.  I was quite impressed with Frankie's ability to pull off a complicated "job;" I didn't think he was smart enough, and he master minded the entire thing!  I witnessed Kiefer Sutherland in a role like I've never seen him before (although he was rather annoying), and he played it very well!  This movie is not as good as "Pulp Fiction," but it does have a little of that flavor.As other reviewers have said, this shows the seamier side of life.  If you like that, rent it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  But if you like "all things quirky," DEFINITELY rent it.</p>
