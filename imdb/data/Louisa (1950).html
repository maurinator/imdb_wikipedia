<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a pity this one isn't available on video or otherwise, I'd acquire it at the drop of a hat!Thoroughly delightful comedy about romantic seniors (Ch. Coburn and Edmund Gwenn) competing for the love of a sweet granny, Louisa (Spring Byington) who still has much to offer in charm, grace and joy of living.There's heated rivalry between the two older men, and there's frustrated annoyance from the younger teen set (Piper Laurie and her beau, Scotty Beckett), and the middle-aged family members (Ronald Reagan and patient wife Meg, played by Ruth Hussey). Inevitably there are clashes, tempers flare and varied misunderstandings arise, but all comes right in the end, of course. This is a scintillating comedy with never a dull moment.I love that delightful scene of Ch. Coburn as Abel Burnside, wading into the pond, trousers soaked, and gallantly picking flowers to offer his lady love, "Louisa", which is also the title of this movie.Top grades for this one.</p>
