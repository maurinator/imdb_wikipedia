<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me start out by saying you just GOTTA love any movie sporting a theme song called "Neon Slime."  One of the best B-Movies of the 80s.  This is a great guilty pleasure type of movie, well acted, solidly directed, and very handsomely photographed for such trash, with occasional unintentionally funny dialogue.  There are plenty of cliches in the "life is Hell on the streets of L.A." storyline, but director Gary Sherman keeps the pace fast, tough and violent and gets colorful performances from even the minor supporting characters.  Wings Hauser makes the chief baddie, a sadistic, psychotic pimp by the name of Ramrod a real piece of work.  He's right up there with other classic movie villains such as Scorpio in "Dirty Harry" and Bruce Dern's Longhair in "The Cowboys."  He's truly a scumbag you'll LOVE to HATE!Note of trivia: Incidentally, Gary Swanson (as the lead cop hot on Ramrod's trail) beat Clint Eastwood to the punch by nearly two years when he uttered the line "Go ahead...make my day" to the pimp on an initial capture in one scene.</p>
