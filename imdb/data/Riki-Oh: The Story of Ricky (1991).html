<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Looking for a serious meditation on the evils of violence in prison? There's probably better (not to mention more realistic and sensitive) portrayals out there. Looks for an over-the-top kung-fu sci-fi masterpiece filled with bucket loads upon bucket loads of cheap gore? Well, this will certainly satisfy you. Being a cult film fanatic, more than once has a cult-classic failed to live up to the hype surrounding it. This one certainly didn't. It is just as lightning-paced and hilarious as everyone says it is. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is the greatest gore flick of all-time. It's certainly my favorite.The plot is has more holes and cheese than a swiss cheese factory. Ricky is a good kid who landed in prison for graphically killing a pimp drug dealer who caused the death of his girl. Now the year is the near future of 2001 and hes in a maximum security prison. He has the opportunity to be in the "Gang of Four" (those into post-punk will have a good chuckle), an elite group of prisoners who control different areas. However, due to their corruption and the evil Warden and Assistant Warden, he decides to be a Christ-like figure for the other prisoners. He sets out to destroy the prison in an extremely gory but wonderfully entertaining fashion.Describing the numerous classic sequences in this film would waste IMDb's valuable space offered to me. I'll just say this, the gore is fantastic. Incredibly fake in that "Braindead"-style, but hilarious. It's hard to get offended by the violence in this film, judging from how over the top it is. Also, the characters are great. The "oh-so-touching" death scenes are priceless and the villains are truly comic book. One man's words cannot describe this kind of brilliance. Only your viewing can. (9/10)</p>
