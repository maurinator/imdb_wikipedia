<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well this film is one of the best of the year 2000.Why?Because it has a good plot , I enjoyed the action scenes and is a very intelligent story.  Joshua Jackson plays a boy who enter in a secret sociaty "The Skulls" where he has marvelous cars , beautiful women and many other pleasures. But everything has a price ,so the pleasure turns in a psycologic thriller where the character "prays" to get out of the group.Behind the group there is a  murder that is connected with Joshua's friend.  The film is very enjoyable ,of corse that there are some mistakes in the plot, but that's O.K!!We understand!!  Just watch the movie like a good distraction , don't judge everything ,be nice with this one.  8 out of 10</p>
