<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If People crack Jokes on Hindi Cinema, because these kind of movies made in 8o's. Producer-Director Rajkumar Kohli had good connection with Stars of 70's and he pored them all. It has no story, no continuity, Action funny and scenes come out as if the whole film is written on shooting location. Story starts with confusion who is the son of whom and director maintain this confusion throughout the film. One of the biggest star cast of Dharmendra, Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Kamal Hassan, Hema Malini, Rina Rai was a total waste. Rajkumar Kohli made one good movie "Naagin" and he just tried to repeat the multi-cast affair in all his films. It is one of the Stupid Film of 80's Try to avoid it at any cost.</p>
