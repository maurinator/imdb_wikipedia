<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A sad tale of two lovers who meet in a high emotional state and break up because the lady, Monika becomes bored with the relationship.  About the highs and lows of love.  Very beautiful in depicting the relationship between Harry and Monika.  Its easy to sympathize with Harry because no matter how hard he tries to make Monika happy he always seems to fail.  It was during the filming of this movie that Ingmar Bergman left his wife for the actress, Harriet Andersson(an act which he would regret and influence him for the rest of his career).  This act would greatly influence Wild Strawberries(1957), Persona(1966), The Touch(1971), Cries & Whispers(1972), and would inspire the Liv Ullman film, Faithless.  The director delivers a film of powerful emotions and raw feelings.  Harriet Andersson is magnificent as the title character.  Sommaren Med Monika/Monika(1953) is the first of many great motion pictures for the legendary filmmaker and visual poet, Ingmar Bergman.</p>
