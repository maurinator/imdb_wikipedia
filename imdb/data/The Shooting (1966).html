<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This especial Western with allegoric qualities deals about a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins), bent on vengeance, forms a group (Will Hutchins, Warren Oates) to escort her across a warm desert . Later on, the posse is joined with a cocky gunfighter (Jack Nicholson) until a surprising finale.Outlandish western is packed with exciting pursuits, noisy gun-play and strong performances . Written, produced (along with an uncredited Roger Corman) and starred by Jack Nicholson. It's well set against the hot barren background and splendidly photographed landscapes by Gregory Sandor. Made back to back with ¨Ride the whirlwind¨ (where some cowboys are mistaken for members of a band) , bears similar cast, cameraman, director and technicians.This offbeat and strange motion picture is well directed by the maverick Monte Hellman . His movies are full of similarly independent-minded stars as Jack Nicholson and Warren Oates ( his habitual actor) and result to be appreciated by the critics but virtually suffer lukewarm reception by the public. His firsts films were produced by Roger Corman , two horror quickies in low budget, titled ¨The beast from haunted cave (1959)¨and ¨Back door to hell (64)¨. After that, he directed two intelligent Western filmed concurrently in 1967 , and ¨Two-lane blacktop (71)¨, describing the underbelly of American life , furthermore ¨Cockfighter (74)¨, a not easily approachable film and sometimes nor even easy understandable . Later on, Hellman has not got his balance right , film-making flops as the Western ¨China 9, Liberty 37 (1979)¨, adventures ¨Iguana (88) and commercial terror as ¨Silent night, deadly night 3 (1989)¨. Nowadays, Hellman only makes failed B movies and television series .</p>
