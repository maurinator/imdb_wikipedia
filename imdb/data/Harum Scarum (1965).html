<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You guys are going a little overboard with your harsh criticisms! OK, so you say the plot is very predictable.can you name off every movie that's not predictable and maybe list over one percent of every movie ever made??? To verbusen: "The times left Elvis behind with the British invasion already 2 years in the go" Yeh, and it was 2 years after this that Elvis came back and killed everyone once again with number singles left and right, right in the middle your British invasion. Yes, the movie had cheap outfits and props and many actions sequence/effects were not so great, but it was 1968 people!!! I'm not exactly watching a lot of 1968 movies that have 3d and cg effects blowing me away here. And to the other people saying it had typical "Elvis music". You must mean some of his filler songs for his movies because if you mean typical as in elvis's music in general you have another thing coming with 30 number 1s and over 1.2 billion records sold!!! Look people it's very simple, Elvis and the people making were not making this movie with the expression "ok, this is our talents at their best and this is the max of our acting, writing and directing skills". Yes, even in those days and for thousands of years before movies the main thing is MONEY!! The people making the film simply said "This is not our best by any means; we are so better than this, but since Elvis is in it people will buy it regardless so lets make it cheap and quick because were getting the money anyways" They had the "spit it out" attitude which is what they did so they could move on to the next project and do the same thing to get their money! You can't have the attitude, "man these people suck!!" They knew it sucked when they made it, they simply didn't care because they knew the same people who said it sucked while leaving the theater would have just payed to see it. And what do ya know.they were right. The movie made double it's money!! Elvis doesn't suck, non of those people sucked, they just didn't care!</p>
