<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was extremely disappointed in this cartoon.  I was recently in the play, and the 'King's kids' from the play and I went to see it today.  I knew that there were some changes, but these were ridiculous! Why have Tuptim fall in love with Chululongkorn and not Lung-Thai?  Why have the Kralahome be a stupid, evil guy when he actually had some intelligence in the play and movie? Why have some guy who can play mind tricks -- what purpose in the movie does he have?  Also, the ballet, one of the best parts, was left out. I don't see why they had to add a monkey that seemed to be taken from "Aladdin," a jaguar, and elephants, when the plot would have been so much better w/o them.  I definitely don't think that the king should have lived at the end.....I don't care if its Disney or not.  The real movie/play is much better.  And as I said at the end, "We were SO much better!"  It's true. Don't plan on seeing it if you are faithful to the real story.</p>
