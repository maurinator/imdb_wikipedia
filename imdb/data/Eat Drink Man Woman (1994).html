<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is one of the best films of all time. It has all the elements of a great movie. From the opening shot to the final I was absolutely riveted to this compelling, truthful, beautiful, and humorous look into the lives of a Taiwanese family. Ang Lee, known quite famously now for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and the upcoming "Hulk" has done a masterful job of directing and storytelling. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. The movie as mentioned focuses on on Widower, Master Chef Chu, who is having a hard time relating to his three independent daughters. He attempts to communicate his love for them by creating these incredible gourmet dinners. The daughters are very defined, each with a different personality. The eldest, is a Christian, which is the first time in a movie I have ever seen, where a Christian is portrayed in a favorable light. She is struggling with being an old maid and the fear of leaving her Father uncared for if she does get married. The second daughter is wild and rebellious. She is portrayed extremely well by the ultra sexy Chien Lien Wu. This woman is absolutely stunning!!! She is torn between three things, her career, her desire to be independent, and her liason's with two men, one who is married. The third daughter is portrayed sweetly and innocent who ends up stealing her best friends boyfriend away. There are many plot twists and turns, but in the end, the movie finishes in a beautiful and happy way. I have now watched this movie twenty times and I think it is a great contribution to the film world. I wish more people knew about it here in the States. This movie can move you to being a better person. On a side note, I highly recommend you order some Chinese food, because you will be starving for it before the movie is over.</p>
