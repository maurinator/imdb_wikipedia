<h1>The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A proper English gentleman, traveling in the American West, inadvertently stops an Indian attack on the stagecoach in which he is a passenger. When the stage gets to the nearest town, the raucous Fractured Jaw--which is being plagued by unruly cowbys, bandits and marauding Indians--the story spreads, and he is appointed sheriff.</p>
<p>Jonathan Tibbs reckons that a good way to improve the fortunes of his uncle's London gun company is to sell their products in the Wild West, so he sets off for Fractured Jaw. Once there, a series of misunderstandings give him the completely false reputation of being a smooth-talking, fast-on-the-draw gunman, and he is inveigled into becoming sheriff. With the two trigger-happy local ranches squaring up against each other, it's as well he is getting advice from sassy and sweet-on-him Kate. The fact he's somehow become an honorary Indian doesn't hurt, either.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A proper British gentleman named Jonathan Tibbs (Kenneth More) attempts to improve the fortunes of his uncle's (Robert Morley) London gun company is to sell their supplies in the Wild West such as his large rifles and small Derringer pistol . Tibbs traveling in the American West , when inadvertently takes place an Indian attack on the stagecoach in which he is a humble passenger (along with comical Brit Sidney James at a brief appearance) . Later on , the stagecoach gets to the nearest little town , as he arrives in troublesome Fractured Jaw which is being plagued by outlaws (William Campbell) and band wars . He then is appointed sheriff by Mayor Masters (Henry Hull) of the raucous town . A series of misunderstandings give him the completely fake reputation of being a skill gunfighter and he is inveigled into becoming a botcher sheriff . Meantime , two trigger-happy local ranchers (Bruce Cabot) squaring up against each other, along with unruly cowboys , villains and marauding Indians . It's as well he is getting advice from gorgeous innkeeper Kate (Jayne Mansfield).Hilarious Western comedy in which Kenneth More as bungler sheriff shows his particular talent ; as he is a London gentleman turned into smooth-talking, fast-on-the-draw gunman . It includes a lot of humor , songs , sprawling , almost primitive action teeming across the screen . A rip-roaring Western/comedy as the conventions of the Wild West are turned upside down . This funny picture is a gag feast , plenty of humor , diverting situations and absurd sketches in Bob Hope style . Amusing and spasmodic comedy with expert comedian British Kenneth More acting in his stereotyped role by relinquishing creative control and concentrating on humor based on confusion and the known formula : ¨fish out water¨ along with nice inventive bits , skilfully combining the entertainment with the amusement . Kenneth More runs away with every cowboy cliché and even arranges to wind up with the girl . Busty as well sultry Jayne Mansfield who ropes the nervous Kenneth More/Jonathan Tibbs into marriage ; sassy and sweetie Jayne Mansfield sings some songs , though her singing voice is dubbed by Connie Francis . Here Jayne Mansfield was 6 weeks pregnant to Mickey Hargitay when production began . Important appearance by Hollywood veteran Henry Hull , as town Mayor and Bruce Cabot : John Ford's usual ; in addition , prestigious Brit secondaries such as Ronald Squire , Sidney James and Robert Morley and uncredited Al Mulock and Steven Berkoff as extra . Lively and adequate musical score by Robert Farnon including catching songs . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Otto Heller . The film has a historical interest , deemed to be the first Western shot in Spain in the following locations : Colmenar Viejo , La Pedriza and Manzanares Del Real , where were subsequently filmed lots of Paella and Spaghetti Western in the 60s and 70s . The motion picture produced by Daniel M. Angel was middlingly directed by Raoul Walsh . From his starts in the silent cinema he achieved successful films until the 50s and forward , early 60s , when he was less dominant , but is still stayed lots of lusty adventure , stories of comradeship and friendship , and Raoul Walsh makes the most of plentiful action scenes . Walsh was an expert director of all kind genres but with penchant in Western as ¨Colorado territory¨ , ¨They died with their boots on¨, ¨Along the great divide¨, ¨Saskatchewan¨, ¨King and four queens¨ , ¨A distant trumpet¨ ; Adventure as ¨Thief of Bagdad¨, ¨Captain Horatio Hornblower¨, ¨World in his hands¨, ¨Blackbeard the pirate¨ , ¨Sea devils¨ ; Warlike as ¨Objetive Burma¨ , ¨Northern pursuit¨, ¨Marines let's go¨ ; and Noir film as ¨White heat¨, ¨High Sierra¨, ¨They drive by night¨, ¨The roaring twenties¨. And this acceptable ¨The sheriff of fractured jaw¨, rating : 5,5/10 ; fairly straightforward movie and passable Western comedy . This average Western film makes it of the lesser interesting of Raoul Walsh genre entries.</p>
