<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set against the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the film's main plot concerns a small platoon of Indian soldiers in the hilly terrain of Ladakh who are considered dead but are rescued by Ladakhi tribesmen and by Capt. Bahadur Singh (Dharmendra). They are asked to retreat from their post (chowky) as the Chinese have surrounded them. Capt. Bahadur Singh and his girlfriend Almo (Priya Rajvansh) die holding the Chinese at Bay so that their comrades can retreat to safety. But even the retreating soldiers are heavily outnumbered and give up their lives for the country.</p>
<p>In July, 1962, China's Red Army started their propaganda that Chinese and Indians are brothers (Hindi-Chini bhai bhai) and at the same time threatened dire consequences if the Indian soldiers did not withdraw from the disputed land near Ladakh in Northeastern India. Ram Singh, Ram Swarup, Major Ranjit Singh, Major Pratap Singh, Captain Bahadur Singh, and his dad Brigadier Singh are amongst the many soldiers that have been deployed to protect India's border with strict instructions that the first shot must come from the Chinese. Bahadur is in love with a Ladakhi/Kashmiri belle by the name of Angmo and has just secured his mother's blessings and permission to marry her. It is at this time that the Chinese launch their attack on all Indian positions and camp. The Indian army soldiers must fight to keep their borders safe, knowing fully well that they may not survive to tell this tale to their loved ones.</p>
<p>A platoon of Indian soldiers encounters harsh realities while fighting in the Sino-Indian War of 1962.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Young Dharmendra at his best. Dharmendra looks so young and smart in army's uniform. Actors like Balraj Sahni and Vijay Anand are too good. Best was movie that Bollywood has produced. Content is based on China war, the difficulties that our army faced in the war are highlighted very well. Songs are amazing. Mohammad Rafi in Kar Chale hum , Mai ye, Hoke, sounds like an angel. Film seems to be shot at beautiful Laddakh. A silent love story goes parallel with the main plot. All the crew like Mac Mohan, Sudhir, as troops have done phenomenally well. There are very good performances from Jayant and Balraj Sahni as well. Black and white shot at Laddakh, army camps, jeeps, etc, strongly recommended. No way rated below 10 out of 10.</p>
