<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the most wonderfully cartoonish and over-the-top spaghetti westerns ever.The great Lee Van Cleef plays Sabata, the bounty hunter who has more tricks than Bugs Bunny. Van Cleef was born to be in spaghetti westerns. Nobody plays these roles better. He is to spaghetti westerns what Bela Lugosi is to Dracula. He is as great as ever in this movie. William Berger is superb also in the role of Banjo, the cool, laid-back, and deadly musician. He and Sabata have a similar on-again-off-again "partnership" to the one that Blondie and Tuco share in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Franco Ressel is perfect as the weird over-the-top villain, "Stengel." The music score is excellent, especially the title tune, which is one of my favorite spaghetti western theme songs. I also really like the use of the organ in the score. It's a nice touch.All spaghetti western fans should have this movie. It's a classic of the genre.</p>
