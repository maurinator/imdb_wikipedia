<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You can usually pick out the work of Rock Demers/Michael Rubbo and the French-Canadian Disney of the North (I meant that in a complimentary way). First, there are no loud, screaming car-chases or machine guns; next, the pace is slow, and the audience has to think along with the cast; third, the kids treat the adults and each other with politeness and respect.....what a novel thought!!! Probably his best effort, 6/10+.</p>
