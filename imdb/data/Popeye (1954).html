<h1>Popeye (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Private Eye Popeye gets a call from Olive Oyl to guard a precious gem. But no sooner does he get the gem than the butler takes it (and Olive). The rest of the cartoon is spent chasing the crook to Paris, the Swiss Alps, and North Africa; Popeye always gets there first, but fails to make the arrest until he lucks into some spinach, of course.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dressed like Sherlock Holmes, Popeye gets a phone which contains only a loud scream. "Garsh, I better trace that call," he says. With a magnifying glass, Popeye walks on the telephone lines across town to a big mansion. Once inside, he's greeted by a woman (Olive Oyl, who he doesn't know in this episode) who is crouched behind a big safe and shooting bullets from a machine gun at him. When she finds out he's the private detective she called, she calms down and tells him she has a job for him. She opens the safe, then a piggy bank and shows him a precious green jewel. "Guard this with your life," she says. Seconds later, a hand comes out of the wall, grabs her and the jewel. Popeye soon discover "the buckler did it!" However, the crook escapes and Popeye goes after him in some very wild scenes on the ground, in the air, and eventually to France, Switzerland, an unnamed Arab country, to the Philippine Islands to the Hawaii Islands (these guys get around fast!) and finally.....to Alcatraz Island.Even though in color, this had a '30s type feel to it with the story and some of the reactions. In all, it was so-so: fun, but just mildly amusing.</p>
