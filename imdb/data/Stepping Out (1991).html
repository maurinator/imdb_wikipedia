<h1>Stepping Out (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stepping Out is a 1991 musical-comedy film directed by Lewis Gilbert, starring Liza Minnelli, written by Richard Harris and based on a play also written by Harris. Minnelli plays the role of a has-been Broadway performer who gives tap lesson to a group of misfits who, through their dance classes, bond and realize what they can achieve.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Paramount didn't know how to market this breezily enjoyable mixture of "Rocky" and "A Chorus Line," and it remains Liza Minnelli's last feature (to date--hope springs enternal). She's terrific as a never-was hoofer whipping a (mostly hilarious) group of would-be tap dancers into shape for a charity show. Nora Dunn steals her scenes as a haughty society dame, while there's also good moments from Andrea Martin, Ellen Greene and the show-stopping Julie Walters ("Canes to me, please, canes to me...."). Liza has a great production number at the end.</p>
