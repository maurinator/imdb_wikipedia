<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had almost forgotten about this movie until I happened upon it while on here. I discovered this movie on TV one night and loved this cute little film. Very funny, charming, creative, touching, great storyline and good acting all around. Unfortunately it appears that it didn't get the publicity and release that it deserved. As others have already said on here, find it if you can, because it is well worth it!!</p>
