<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>God Bless the Beatles.  They're one of the few musical groups that still remain as fresh and entertaining even today.  And that applies to their films as well.  "Help!" is a lot of fun.  Take the fab four with a  goofy plot of Ringo being the target of religious sacrificial cult, add a handful of great songs, and that's the movie.  The one-liners in this film are still very funny, with plenty of "groaners" and the typical quick British wit.  Really nice camera work, great sets (the Beatles' apartment showcases clever diversity for each member's personality) and just wild sub-plots throughout the film.  (Paul's tiny adventure and the tank chase comes to mind.)  As I said before, the film's main asset is the music, and one can't help but find themselves caught up in the songs.  The strangest thing in the film is when it abruptly veers away from the cult chase to numerous songs and the Beatles just playing around.  Even with a few more attempts on poor Ringo's finger, it seems like everyone takes a break from the chase.  It really doesn't matter, however.  The Beatles seem to be having a good time, and you can't help but join in."Help!" is a great showcase of Beatles music, fun writing and clever visuals.  While not as great as "A Hard Day's Night", those who enjoyed that movie will be hard-pressed to find anything wrong here.</p>
