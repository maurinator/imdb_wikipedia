<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Enjoyed this film mainly because I like Broderick Crawford, (Vinnie Harold) who was too old and too fat to be the fastest gun in this film and a great young star Glenn Ford, (George Temple) who had dark deep secrets to hid in the small town of Cross Creek. George Temple was married to Dora Temple, (Jeanne Crain) who had to suffer with her husband's past and they finally decided to locate in a new town to live in and they were store owners. However, George had a real bad habit of loving guns and also being an expert sharp shooter. Vinnie Harold went from town to town looking for the fastest gun and killed everyone that he came across who thought he could out draw him in a good old Western duel in the street of some town. Jeanne Crain gave a great supporting role and looked very young and pretty along with a very handsome looking Glenn Ford. This is a good classic 1956 black and white film, but is very entertaining.</p>
