<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What's so good about this picture? Well, it's actually very well shot and some very nice writing by Mamet.Many people probably haven't even heard of this picture, the title is uninspiring but the film isn't.The direction is superb, the widescreen frame is filled with details and characters use the 2.35:1 scope very well. The film is shot with the cinema screen in mind, not pan and scan. The photography is beautiful, the landscape comes alive, sometimes it steals the picture away from the characters.The acting is fine, but sometimes a bit more meat was  required in the middle of the picture. I don't think the actors had enough depth, but overall not bad.The picture is about survival and that's all I will say.The final frames are disappointing, should've been handled better.The director did a terrific job capturing the Alaska terrain.As usual, please view this picture in widescreen otherwise people you would have only seen 57% of the picture. There is only one way to enjoy the photography,  and that's in widescreen.</p>
