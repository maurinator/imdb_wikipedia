<h1>A Summer's Tale (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A shy maths graduate takes a holiday in Dinard before starting his first job. He hopes his sort-of girlfriend will join him, but soon strikes up a friendship with another girl working in town. She in turn introduces him to a further young lady who fancies him. Thus the quiet young lad finds he is having to do some tricky juggling in territory new to him.</p>
<p>In the centre of part 3 of Rohmer's "4 Seasons-Cycle" stands a young man, Gaspard, who went to Dinard (a town by the sea in the Bretagne) because he hopes to meet the girl he thinks he is in love with - Lena. Shortly after his arrival he comes into contact with Margot who works as a servant at her aunt's creperie. He spends a long time with her, and discusses the way he feels about Lena but he hesitates to tell the truth about his relationship. The reason is that he isn't quite sure himself. Although he insists he loves Lena, doubts arise...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of Rohmer's best. Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) takes a month long vacation to a beach in Normandy, waiting for his more or less official girlfriend, the somewhat snotty Lena (Aurelia Nolin), to come. While waiting for her, he befriends the waitress and aspiring anthropologist Margot (Rohmer regular Amanda Langlet). Eventually, a relationship between the two develops, which seems to consists almost exclusively of long talks in the beach. But this is not all, since he soon also meets the somewhat promiscuous (but "principled") Solene (Gwaenelle Simon) in a disco. When Lena finally arrives to the resort, more than halfway into the movie, he finally finds himself in the position of having to choose one of the three. Rohmer would want us to think that Margot would be the best choice, and is difficult to disagree, since she's so charming and so willing to listen to him and even put up with him. It's amazing how Rohmer (who was in his late 70s when he directed this) is able to portray realistically how young people talk and interact. The final decision by Gaspard was a bit of a disappointment, but it was probably the more realistic possibility.</p>
