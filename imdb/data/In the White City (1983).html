<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In his long career as one of Swiss cinema's biggest as well as famous directors, Alain Tanner has made many "self discovery" genre of films. These are films in which actors are mere tools to propagate directors' ideas about art, creativity and life as they also turn out to be their alter egos. The opinion about these films is divided. Some viewers consider them to be absolutely pretentious. There are also viewers who judge these films to be intelligent. As a film critic, I chose to watch this film as it is a film admired by my friend Jean-Jacques Beineix. In the white city is an intelligent film about loneliness, loss of companionship with surprising erotic elements. It would appeal to viewers as it raises many questions about which no definitive answers can be found. One is free to choose as many personal interpretations as possible. These questions are related to a person's desire to escape from everything which is an essential part of life. Dans La Ville Blanche / In the white city connects easily with viewers especially those intrepid souls who would like to escape from all forms of civilization. Apart from actor Bruno Ganz in one of the best roles of his career, city of Lisbon emerges as a major star attraction. It is worth exploring for the turbulent nature of its old city, markets, and pool halls.</p>
