<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Company is far and away the absolute best non-traditional plot Hindi movie ever. I think it is even better than Sholey. It ranks up there with Scarface... no, I take it back, Company is BETTER than Scarface. I am a big gangster/mafia movie fan, and there a lot of great ones out there -- both Hindi and American -- The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Heat, Sathiya, Gangster, Khattay... but Company takes the friggin cake.Gripping plot, phenomenal acting, engaging soundtrack... this movie will have you enthralled from the moment you hit play till the closing credits, after which time you will think about the movie for hours. Vivek Oberoi is masterful, Ajay Devgan is flawless. Based on a true story, this is THE Indian movie of the decade. Ram Gopal Varma hits a home run with this masterpiece.</p>
