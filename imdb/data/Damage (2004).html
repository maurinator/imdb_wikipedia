<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When the episode begins, Enterprise is a total mess. It's crippled and unable to move, crew members are dead and yet the Reptilians called off their attack because the Xindi Council want to discuss the humans and the possibility that they and not the humans are the villains. However, Archer is still being held--but now it's with the Aquatics. Oddly, he's knocked out and when he awakens, he's being welcomed back aboard Enterprise. Apparently the Aquatics put him in a tiny capsule and launched him back to his ship. Why did they releases Archer? At the same time a battered Archer is brought aboard and he's planning a raiding party to steal a Xindi warp coil, T'Pol is starting to fall apart. She is an emotional mess and argues, very emotionally, with the Captain about his plan to steal the device. After all, it's a slippery moral slope and his disregard for ethics is scary. This is a very good and exciting episode...no doubt about it. The show is full of action, plot twists and ethical dilemmas. But it also brings up a few minor questions. First, why is the space suit that T'Pol uses so crappily made? It is the 23nd century after all! Also, whenever you see the Aquatics, they're in water that is kinda yellowish. Is this Aquatics pee? And finally, showing naked folks would seem to indicate that the producers of the show are willing to try ANYTHING to get folks to watch the show. Am I right? I am just curious and want to know about all three of these things.</p>
