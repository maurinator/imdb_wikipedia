<h1>Synanon (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film chronicles the goings on at Synanon House, a rehabilitation center for people with all kinds of addictions. Chuck Dederich, a recovering alcoholic, founded and runs Synanon House.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the first movies to show drug addicts & their attempts to 'get clean'. Main character 'Joaney' played by the great STELLA STEVENS is an addict that is trying to straighten out her life and get custody of her son. She is attending counseling sessions at the famed SYNANON HOUSE in sunny California. Lots of good acting support from off-key sources like EARTHA KITT. Overall, film is average.</p>
