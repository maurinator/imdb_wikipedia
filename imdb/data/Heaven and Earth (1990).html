<h1>Heaven and Earth (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Warlords Kagetora and Takeda each wish to prevent the other from gaining hegemony in feudal Japan. The two samurai leaders pursue one another across the countryside, engaging in massive battles of cavalry and infantry. Younger and less brutal, Kagetora must find the strength to be as brutal as his opponent, but at what cost?</p>
<p>This magnificent and stunningly filmed movie is based on feudal Japan during the 16th century. The ruling Shogun has lost control over his country and the local lords are taking what they want, or protecting theirs from others. The film revolves around two main characters; one (Takeda) is older and his ambitions are driving him to conquer, and then rule the entire country. The other (Kagetora) is young, fair to his people, doesn't have the desire to conquer, but does so only to protect what is his, and is in love with his advisor's daughter, even though he's taken an oath of celibacy in return for the strength to fight and preserve his kingdom. Kagetora's domain lies in the path of Takeda and the two must eventually meet and fight, until one is the victor.</p>
<p>In 16th century Japan, two samurai engage in massive battles across the countryside; one attempting to conquer and the other attempting to defend his land while repressing his love for a woman after taking a vow of celibacy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the best samurai films I have ever seen, the screen images are out standing and the plot line is solid, this film is truly a hidden gem and should be seen. I have seen this film a few times and have enjoyed watching it each time, which is the mark of a good film. I enjoyed the large battle scenes which rival any scenes from the best Hollywood can produce. It is truly refreshing to see such films from non Hollywood sources. I would have to say that this was the best samurai film in its decade and possibly one of the best films I have ever seen. I would suggest this film to any samurai buff or anybody who enjoys a visually stunning film.</p>
