<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is Romania's shot at the great western genre... The only word that comes to mind to encompass what this movies is about is: HI-LA-RI-OUS ! I'm Romanian and there's not that many Romanian movies that I really enjoyed, but this one really breaks the norm. You just have to watch it and enjoyed it.I don't want to give any spoilers so I won't say much about the plot. It's just a couple of peasants from Transylvania going over to the wild west to see their brothers that were established gunfighters there..Watch it and you won't regret it. It doesn't have 1 minute of boredom for me, it's all Ha-ha-ha...</p>
