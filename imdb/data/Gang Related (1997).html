<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is not too bad, once you get past the fact that it stars TuPac Shakur... I mean, after Poetic Justice, did anybody think he could act?  I sure didn't.  He was a great artist, but acting wasn't his forte. Actually, to be honest, I didn't expect great things after seeing Poetic Justice, but he wasn't too bad in this movie after all.However, when watching this movie, the question I kept asking myself was, "How can these two fools make this situation any worse?"  In fact, I think that's what makes this film work.  I spent most of my time waiting to see what kind of crazy coincidence would pop up next.  The film certainly doesn't disappoint if you like plot twists, even if you can see them a mile away.Overall, this is a pretty good drama about corrupt cops.  I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon when there's nothing fantastic on TV, or for a Sunday if you aren't a football or racing fanatic.  Just don't waste your money on it for a Friday night, you should be watching new releases on Fridays.My Rating:  8/10</p>
