<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dennis Hopper delivers the goods in this meticulously conventional tale of a charismatic underachiever finding his level.  Harkening back to the gender and class warfare sensibilities of the Forties, The Hot Spot excels across the board, in acting, dialogue, plotting, music, and cinematography.</p>
