<h1>White Wolves: A Cry in the Wild II (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A two-week trek through the Cascade Mountains tries the survival instincts of five adventurous teenagers. At first, it's all a good time. Shooting the rapids, exploring caves and making new friends. But when an accident occurs, Mother Nature raises the stakes and challenges the hikers to the greatest test of their young lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first law of storytelling says that you need a conflict in order to have a story. The question in this film is whether there is enough conflict to maintain sufficient interest through a feature-length production. The film never goes much beyond the basic premise - kids trek into the wild, kids get lost in the wilds, one gets injured. There is more drama and intrigue to the average Readers Digest real-life crisis feature than there is on display here.The scenery is easily the star of the show, and is not always shown to best effect. The scenes of interaction with dangerous animals are badly handled, and the result is strictly a by-the-numbers job. Unless you particularly like one of the actors or simply must see every film in this genre, there isn't much to recommend this.</p>
