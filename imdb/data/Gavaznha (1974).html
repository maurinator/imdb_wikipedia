<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had watched this movie two times. But I decided to watch again this movie after about 8 years. This time I enjoy even more despite I knew all the story. Nobody can watch this movie without crying even if it's not the first time seeing movie. I didn't know Faramarz Gharibian had part in this movie. Another great acting by Behrouz Vosoughi. I enjoyed the music. This movie had some limitations. They wanted Farhad to sing for that song but they didn't permitted. Also I think they change the poem of song. really beautiful music. Friendship Persian style. Lot of touching scenes. I think this is the best movie about addiction and maybe best Persian movie(in my opinion yes). I recommend this movie.</p>
