<h1>Marquis (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The scene is a pre-French Revolution Bastille, where various political prisoners are being held: a woman who was raped and impregnated by the king, a police chief who was accused of selling bad pork, and the Marquis, who was unjustly accused of working for the overthrow of the king. The Marquis is only interested in writing his deviant stories, while his penis yearns for a little action (they argue about this frequently), the prime candidate being the jailer who likes to be buggered. The corrupt priest arranges to have the pregnant woman raped by the Marquis so they can claim the king had nothing to do with it. The priest also steals the Marquis' manuscripts and publishes them for his own profit. Things come to a head as the people rise up against the tyranny.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Until I saw 'Quills' I thought I had repressed the memory of this weird animated take on the Marquis de Sade. A man is imprisoned and spends his time talking to his equally animated penis who has opinions of his own.It's been awhile since I even thought about this film but I don't remember hating it, though nobody I knew would go with me to see it. Every character is represented by an talking human/animal. The marquis slides his member through a crack in between the loose rocks in his cell and hurts himself pretty badly. He cuts himself open to use his own blood to write his stories. A cow/woman gets raped and produces milk/blood out of her udders which is grotesque.I guess the story is riveting if you're in the theatre with nowhere else to go. Otherwise, you may find yourself returning to the place where you rented this, complaining to the management. Sorry I couldn't be of more help in this review, but it was over ten years ago.</p>
