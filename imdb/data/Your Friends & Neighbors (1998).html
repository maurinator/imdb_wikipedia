<h1>Your Friends & Neighbors (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Theater instructor Jerry starts an affair with Mary, and that starts a chain of events that affect their respective partners Terri and Barry and other characters in the film, creating a web of relationships.</p>
<p>Unhappy couples fall apart and hop into other beds with other people.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>With a better cast and an even more  disturbing group of characters, Neil LaBute  failed to disappoint in his sophomore effort.  Laced with dark dialogue and realistic reactions  conducive to the actions of the characters,  this film actually surpasses In The Company  of Men in regards to the evil that is known  as the human condition. With some great  performances by the likes of Jason Patric,  Catherine Keener, Ben Stiller, Amy Brenneman  and Aaron Eckhart, this film really sucks you  into this unsatisfied world of betrayal and sex.  A film only Todd Solondtz couldn't have made  (if anyone else could have made it).</p>
