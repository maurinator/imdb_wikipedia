<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was a welcome change from the typical werewolf flick.  First off, we have Jack.  Jack rules.  Also, we have a good story that relates to adult life.  This movie seems to pay tribute to classic werewolf films such as "The Wolf Man" with its basic formula of: Normal man, man bitten, man realizes something wrong, man discovers cool abilities, man uses abilities, man's abilities become out of control, man seeks help, man gets mystical amulet, man seeks resolution.  It works very well, and this movie has great acting in it.  Consider it a corporate werewolf flick, a more mature look at the beast in all of us.</p>
