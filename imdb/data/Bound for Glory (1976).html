<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film is an excellent biography of Woody Guthrie, one of America's greatest folk singers. He left his dust-devastated Texas home in the 1930s to find work, and discovered the suffering and strength of America's working class.</p>
<p>In 1936 Pampa, Texas, there isn't much work to be had, including for the local sign painter, Woody Guthrie. Woody's wife, Mary Guthrie, seems more concerned about the lack of money to feed their family than Woody, who passes the time playing his guitar and singing songs he's written. But as many before him have done, Woody decides to go on the road, specifically to California, stories about where there is plenty of work to be had. Along the way both by riding the rails and hitching rides, Woody hopes to paint a few signs to earn a meal, and play his guitar in his spare time. Once in California, he finds that the land of plenty is not so much so, but the spirit of those looking for work is strong. His fortunes change when he meets union organizer and popular singer Ozark Bule in one of the farm labor camps. Based on what he sees around him and his experiences with Ozark, Woody begins to write more politically based songs about the working class. Ozark manages to get Woody on a local radio broadcast, which leads to a regular local radio program with another singer named Memphis Sue. But in his musical life and spending time with Ozark organizing the laborers, Woody finds that he has to balance the popular aspect of being an entertainer - which is solely what the radio station owner and the show's sponsors hired him for - against airing his political views through his music. He also has to try and find a way to balance his want to spread his messages to the masses while maintaining a home life with Mary and the kids.</p>
<p>The early life of Woody Guthrie as a vagabond folk singer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Bound For Glory" is a very involving and interesting movie in a hypnotic, slow-moving seventies kind of way. In fact, for the first 45 minutes I was watching it on cable TV, I had no idea why I was watching it. Nothing much was happening. The "story" was episodic and meandering. But I did watch the thing all the way through--all 2 and a half hours of it. In retrospect, I can now see some reasons why the film held me so. To begin with, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is wonderful. But mostly it was the acting, which is uniformly excellent in a naturalistic way that is rarely seen these days. I had the impression I was peeking in on real people and events, not on movie actors playing out a script. The biggest revelation, however, was David Carradine, who gives an amazing performance as Woody Guthrie. He's just living the part. I mean--what has the guy ever done before or since that even hinted at the fact that he could act so damn well? Nothing, that's what! Carradine's performance in "Bound for Glory" reminds me of two other, more recent performances in similar films: Ashley Judd in Victor Nunez's "Ruby in Paradise" and Peter Fonda in the role that gave him an Oscar nomination, "Ulee's Gold", also by Nunez.In these films you can see the main character thinking, breathing--living. Not acting out some melodrama.Another common thread runs between these three performances, too: none of these actors have been allowed to (or been able to?) do work anywhere near as good again. The post-"Ruby" Judd has gone on to major in spunky thriller heroines and Fonda has drifted back off the map to wherever he was before "Ulee."But Carradine is the one who really breaks your heart. He has continued acting, like Judd. But the horrendous quality of his projects make you wish he'd disappeared back in to the vapor of obscurity, like Fonda. After watching "Bound For Glory", the sight of Carradine zombie-walking through an episode of "Kung Fu: the Legend Continues" or snarling like a brain-dead idiot in one of his European-made direct-to-video action cheapies is enough to make you cry. The massive talent he wasted. Still, many actors never have even one moment of glory.</p>
