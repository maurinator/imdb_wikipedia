<h1>Electra, My Love (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It has been fifteen years since the death of her father, Agamemnon, and Elektra still burns with hatred for Aegisztosz, who conspired with Elektra's mother to kill him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>More like a play filmed on a barren plain, this movie is marked by long takes and constant motion of people and horses in the background.  A nice re-telling of the wait for Orestes' homecoming blending anachronistic props and ancient rituals seeming to come from "Le Sacre du Printemps." Constant dancing and mass movement of horses with the the drumming of the hoofbeats and the gunshot cracks of whips makes sound a character itself and adds tension to the whole movie.  Avoid this unless you like art films and the unusual.</p>
