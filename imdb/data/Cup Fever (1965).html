<h1>Cup Fever (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The children of Barton United are trying to win the cup in their local football (soccer) league. Nasty councillor Mr Bates doesn't like them and wants the team his son plays for to win instead so he makes life as difficult as he can for them. But Barton United are offered help by the local professional team that just happens to be Manchester United with boss man Matt Busby. Look out for a young 'Susan George' in her first film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film will appeal to many UK residents of a certain age, who can remember the Saturday morning cinema clubs and this Children's Film Foundation offering is one of the classics of those heady 60's years.Shot entirely on location in Manchester and Salford this film offers a glimps of a time and an age of innocence long since lost. A simple but well crafted story about the fortunes of a group of local kids whose lives revolve around their passion for football (soccer for those American members).I had the good fortune of being able to buy this on dvd recently as part of a series of Childen's Film Foundation releases - well worth it!</p>
