<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great episode. The story of a mother who is accused of endangering her kids is having taken them away from her and puts herself on fire as a suicide. It was so strong. I felt horrible for the woman. I just find it sad they try to make it look like she was a bad mother and Susan made a right decision. Come on, having a Bloody Mary on a lunch with lawyer or buying beer is not something a parent can't do. And her suicide was her being driven into it by the threat of having her kids removed, she didn't know her son followed her and saw it. I liked though how they showed Susan struggling about her decision afterwards. Good acting by Sherry Stringfield. Wish they just made it more about not screwing up people's lives over nothing. The scene of the burned woman saying good bye to her little kid was also very sad.Watching ER is like star gazing. So many known faces in almost every episode. This one has Bob Newhart as an old man losing his eyesight and Daniel Dae Kim drops by as a social worker. Linda Cardellini is also joining the cast as a nurse. She seems a bit arrogant, but had a great entrance when she takes the syringe from struggling Dr. Morris to perform the task.Dr. Morris is an example on how the ER can be too hard for some, he sure was the one doctor and student who I saw having the most trouble on the show. But it is kind of realistic, it is not an easy profession.Abby going back to med school is also an interesting twist of events. Wonder if Susan telling her that she can't talk to her patient because she is a nurse and not a doctor contributed to it.</p>
