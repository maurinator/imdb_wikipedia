<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When NBC hired the producers and cast members of "Second City Television" for "SCTV Network 90," they provided them with a larger budget and longer programming time than the original show had.  As a result, the performers/writers elaborated on the show's original premise of a cheap TV station.  Established characters like Joe Flaherty's Guy Caballero and Andrea Martin's Edith Prickley were deepened with more quirks that often thematically unified the sketches, such as an episode when Guy's job as station owner is threatened when he forges a check.  The sketches became lengthier and more layered, exploring further possibilities in television satire, such as a "Godfather" parody likening TV executives to mob bosses. And SCTV still maintained its comic bite, thanks to both the writing and the performers.  The humor remained intelligent and insightful and unlike SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE never became self-consciously hip or stale.  SCTV 90 provided some of the greatest TV comedy ever, the like which we may never see again.</p>
