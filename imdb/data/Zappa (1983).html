<h1>Zappa (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Denmark, 1961. Bjørn, a middle-class boy in his early teens, wants to be accepted by Steen, a bullying peer of his with wealthy but freezingly cold parents. Bjørn's other good friend is Mulle, a cheerful and more childish working-class boy. All three seem friends at first, but gradually Steen starts pushing Mulle away while pulling the impressionable Bjørn with him towards more and more tragic violent behavior, fueled by frustration over his loveless home life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently viewed Zappa after watching Twist and Shout, they came packaged together on DVD. Both films are absolutely wonderful, great performances, visuals, stories. The three lead actors in Zappa are incredible, but it is the work of Morton Huff as Mulle that really packs an emotional wallop. I am a huge fan of coming of age films, and Scandinavia really turns out some gems. There's something in that snowy socially responsible region that American films can never duplicate without looking completely schmaltzy and emotionally heavy-handed. Something innocent, unassuming, unphony, completely unforced (am I being redundant?). There's a natural style and grace. I feel blessed that films like these exist and lucky to stumble upon them now and then.</p>
