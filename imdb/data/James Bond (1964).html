<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Guns of James Bond, The (1964) ** 1/2 (out of 4) BBC produced documentary has Sean Connery hosting as he introduces gun expert Geoffrey Boothroyd. Boothroyd talks about the various weapons used by James Bond and why he feels the Walther isn't a good gun to use. He talks about Ian Flemming using this gun and we also get three demons of other guns and the damage they could have been done. This here is certainly for Bond die-hards only. There's nothing too wrong here but it was a decent little short as it's clear Boothroyd knows what he's talking about and he gives good opinions on why certain weapons just wouldn't work. This film runs a very quick five-minutes and is pretty simple all around. The one good thing is that we see some footage of Connery on the GOLDFINGER set.</p>
