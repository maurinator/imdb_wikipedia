<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yeah Ghosts of Mars! Liked the movie a lot.Liked the soundtrack, the heavy angst ridden sounds fit real well with the surreal psychedelic imagery and well accent the bleak horror of being in a situation where the force to fight against is super horrific and unseen.There is nowhere to go and no way to survive except to fight in an all out only the strong and fast can survive,shoot,splatter,and chop mode.This is reminiscent of the bleak and inescapable horror of John Carpenters masterful remake of "the Thing".It put me in the space of hopelessness and despairing odds.A tailor-made"B" movie of excellence.This movie reminded me of one of my favorite authors of science fiction and horror,Mick Farren.Specifically his book "Mars-The Red Planet".The storyline and imagery are similar.If you liked "Ghosts",then you might want to check out this Del Ray book,out of print but available in used condition. Anyways Kudo's to Carpenters Ghost's of Mars</p>
