<p>Admiral Kirk and his bridge crew risk their careers stealing the decommissioned Enterprise to return to the restricted Genesis planet to recover Spock's body.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I was a kid and saw "Star Trek 3" in the theatre, I thought it was great. But watching it again as an adult I can see the flaws in it. It's an enjoyable film, but there's some things that don't make sense.1. When Kirk goes to the federation, and explains the situation about Spock, why wouldn't they order the casket to be retrieved, and transported back to starfleet?2. The Klingons want a weapon that doesn't exist anymore. They want the genesis device so they can have a quasi nucleur weapon, but the device blew up in #2. Why didn't anybody point that out to them?Beyond logical problems so to speak, there's the filmmaking. Nimoy did the best he could with the slim budget Paramount gave him, but crummy sets are crummy sets. Location shooting would have been so much better.A lot of people will say that Robin Curtis did a bad job compared to Kirstie. I thought she did OK, but probably would have done better if she was directed by Nicolas Meyer like Kirstie was.</p>
