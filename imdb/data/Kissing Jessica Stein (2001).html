<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ive used 'marinade' as a verb - so I was bound to like this one.Highly enjoyable, honest, witty and refreshing.  As good a movie as gets made these days.  Finally a film driven by likable, intelligent characters and their relationships, not guns, explosions and two dimensional stereotypes and plots by (and for) 8 years olds.KJS has a dash of fantasy from time to time, a cracking sound track, and although I wouldnt have called it a comedy - it's funny when it needs to be.  But I think it was the honesty of the writing that I particularly took to - that and the moments that surprise.  As many have noted - the scene with the mother on the veranda is a bit special.If you like Woody Allen then this is one for you.  If you look forward to the next Van Diesel effort, then I doubt you will stay beyond the credits...ps Was the dedication 'For our parents' at the end of the film ironic?  Watching this film with your parents could quite possibly be the single most embarrassing experience of your life.....if they are anything like mine that is....</p>
