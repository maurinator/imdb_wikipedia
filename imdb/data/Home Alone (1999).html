<h1>Home Alone (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After a long winter confined to the cabin with Rich and Pan, Gloria Hobson is eager for some time alone. But she discovers that springtime in the Natchako includes far more than flowers. Meanwhile, the men go on a dangerous hunt for missing cattle.</p>
<p>Rich, Gloria and Pan are literally getting cabin fever, being cooped up in the one-room cabin together over the winter. Once spring hits, the first order of business for Rich and Pan is to bring in the cattle from their winter pastures. They are happy to get away for a few days if only to escape Gloria's cooking, which she is unaware is pretty bad. Rich and Pan learn that some of the herd have wandered across Corkscrew Creek into Nechako Indian country. They're a little worried because of the history of the Nechackos, namely the Nechako Massacre of 1822. Rich and Pan venture across the creek to retrieve the strays. They learn that battle rules have changed since the massacre over one hundred years earlier. Meanwhile, Tommy, Ed and Kit are tasked with retrieving the main herd, a task which also ends up not being as easy as it should be. Back at the cabin, Gloria is looking forward to her time alone, which ends up being not as tranquil as she was expecting and hoping.</p>
