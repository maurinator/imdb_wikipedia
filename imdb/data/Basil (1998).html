<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Please take my advice and don't subject yourself to the horror of watching this movie. I suppose the cover should have warned me, but I thought the adequate cast might save it from the first impression the DVD cover made. I was wrong. There were multiple scenes that I cringed at the dialogue and the acting was horrible. I generally like Jared Leto's choice of roles, but this was a major blunder. It just didn't suit him. In his defense, though, I don't think the script could have been saved by anyone. Basically it was a dismal, fragmented movie that lacked flow from short unimpressive scenes that served no purpose but to hold the frail story together. But if you'd rather, see for yourself. Maybe I missed the deeper meaning... :)</p>
