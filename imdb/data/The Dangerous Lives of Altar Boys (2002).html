<h1>The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In mid-1970s Savannah, two bright but rebellious boys, Francis Doyle and Tim Sullivan, fight boredom, hormones and harsh teachers as they struggle to find something meaningful beyond the walls of their parish school. Francis, an exceptional artist whose imaginative forays into a fictional universe of good and evil fill his notebooks with comic-book imagery, creates a netherworld of superhero alter egos for the two boys. When the ultra-strict Sister Assumpta seizes their artwork one day, the boys embark upon an obsessed trail of revenge that ultimately changes their lives.</p>
<p>In the Seventies, the fifteen years old troublemaker and leader altar boy Tim Sullivan and his three great friends, Francis Doyle, Wade Scalisi and Joey Anderson, study in a repressive Catholic school, and they hate their nun-teacher Sister Assumpta. Francis has a crush on Margie Flynn, who has a dramatic secret in her life. They like to write a comic book called 'The Atomic Trinity' and all of them have an alter-ego in their superheroes: Brakken (Francis), The Muscle/Skeleton Boy later (Tim), Captain Asskicker (Wade) and Major Screw (Joey), with Sorcerella (Margie) joining them later. Francis uses to fantasize reality with the fantastic situations the heroes face against the evil Nunzilla/Pegleg, a dark caricature of Sister Assumpta. The group plots an evil prank against Sister Assumpta, with tragic consequences.</p>
<p>A group of Catholic school friends, after being caught drawing an obscene comic book, plan a heist that will outdo their previous prank and make them local legends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well now we have a film that tends to capture some of the child's mind qualities of "stand by me" mixed creatively with some creative cinematic and an interesting plot line.The story follows four friends going to a catholic school and getting together causing trouble drawing comics and otherwise being boys. The main story starts when Jenna Malone's character comes in and turns some of the relationships on their heads. There is a lot to be said about the dynamics of growing up and coming to terms with life.This story is quite dark and goes through a different line than many movies of it's type and therefore is not quite as viewer friendly as stand by me. The ending may also be debatable but I will let you as the viewer decide.The story cuts into animated scenes to illustrate the imagination of the main character and does a fair job conveying the emotions and relationships throughout the plot. These scenes are of course brought to you by Todd McFarlane himself and again isn't exactly child friendly.In the end this is a movie for adults but does a good job moving the message it goes about trying to convey. It is creative and draws you in. The plot is a bit dark and it does have some issues that may not sit with many viewers. All in all I believe this is a good film.</p>
