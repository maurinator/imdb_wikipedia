<h1>Bop Girl Goes Calypso (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>To prove his theory that rock and roll is on its way out, a sociologist tries to convince a "bop" singer to switch to calypso, much to the ire of her Hollywood nightclub manager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not a "lost movie" but was in fact shown on TCM in March, 2008. It could have stayed in the vaults. As is usual with this type of film, the primary value is in being able to see 1950's rock groups do their stuff. The rock groups are shuffled off, though, and replaced by, ready now, calypso acts, because rock and roll will soon be dead after 1957, to be replaced by the irresistible rhythms of the Caribbean. I wonder how that turned out? Otherwise the production values are pretty low, the plot (a term I use very loosely) is thin and any pleasure in watching this attempt at entertainment bottoms out pretty quickly. You do at least get to see Judy Tyler, the original Princess Summerfall Winterspring of Howdy Doody, who starred with Elvis in "Jailhouse Rock" and then tragically was lost in a car accident months later.</p>
