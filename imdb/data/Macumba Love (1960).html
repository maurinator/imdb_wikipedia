<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>J. Peter Wells, an expose writer, arrives on an island off the coast of South America (no country identified), to complete a book on voodoo, ju-ju,macumba, mojo and other cult beliefs, which he believes is responsible for unsolved murders on this island. Wealthy land-owner Venis de Vias warns him against stirring up the natives, especially any efforts to lessen the prestige of the reigning VooDoo Queen Mama Rata-loi. The arrival of Wells' daughter, Sara, and her husband, Warren, on a honeymoon trip, starts the pot to boiling and making the natives restless. Most restless of all is Mama Rata-loi, who asserts her powers and puts a spell on Venus de Viasa. The next thing honeymooner Warren knows is that he is trussed up and about to become the one chosen to die in a voodoo ceremony.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An interesting memory was jogged at seeing the listing for this film.I saw this at the drive in when I was 8 and, of course, in my jammies.I tried to go to sleep in the back seat but was terrified by the voodoo. 44 years later I still remember that damn movie as the bane of my young drive in experience, lol.My 81 year-old mother still laughs whenever I mention it, although she insists that it was only a "Joe Palooka" doll that was used, and that I actually fell asleep and only woke up at the scary scenes. I seem to recall a different set of facts, but no one else is around to corroborate my story.I wonder...could she be one of the undead, too?</p>
