<h1>The War Lord (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A knight in the service of a duke goes to a coastal villiage where an earlier attempt to build a defensive castle has failed. He begins to rebuild the duke's authority in the face of the barbarians at the border and is making progress until he falls in love with one of the local women.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Painstakingly accurate historical epic that has Norman knight Heston, in charge of an 11th-century Druid community. He exercises his right to claim bride Forsyth on the night of her wedding, and she then falls for the knight, refusing to leave his side. Seeking vengeance, Farentino, the son of Druid leader MacGinniss, foments an all-out war between Heston and Heston's covetous brother (Stockwell). Despite the impressive scope of the battle scenes, The War Lord, based on a stage play by Stevens, is an intimate drama. Still, the sure-handed direction of Schaffner and the credible performances of Heston et al are well complemented by Morross's driving, Stravinsky-like score.</p>
