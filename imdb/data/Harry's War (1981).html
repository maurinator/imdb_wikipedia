<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the mid-1980s I once saw part of an interview with David Ogden Stiers, who played the IRS agent/director in this great film.  He was asked about what his favorite role had been, and I got this idea that the interviewer was expecting him to say something about his character in M*A*S*H.  But instead he paused for a second, and said "There was this movie about the IRS, and I was the biggest ep] in the office...." at which point they cut to a commercial.Unfortunately, I didn't bother to note what program this was, and it's been so many years ago that I'm not even sure I'm recalling everything right.  But it was funny enough to remember all this time.By-the-way, the Harry character gives a pretty good speech about his position near the end of the film -- it's not really all that radical or "anti-government" so much as it is anti-bureaucratic abuse and pro-freedom.   Highly recommended, overall.There are still a few sources (some online) with copies of this movie available -- you just have to look around.</p>
