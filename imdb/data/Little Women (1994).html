<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I saw Little women I noticed I had seen my favourite movie, I could not believe  a film where my favourite actors played together in one of the most beautiful stories ever written. Gilliam Armstrong`s adaptation is the best I`ve seen,the performances were incredible, specially, Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. But all of them where great, it also has a wonderful score, one of the most beautiful soundtracks I`ve ever heard, Thomas Newman did an excellent job, the script, made by Robin Swicord,is very loyable to the book by Louisa May Alcott.This film is beautiful in all its aspects, it was excellent the friendship and collaboration between all the actors, and for the first time most of them were played by actors of the same age as their fictional characters. The character of Jo has influenced me a lot, and I adore her, Winona Ryder did the best performance of his career, Christian Bale is the best Laurie I`ve ever seen, he did it great, he was so credible, it is difficult to understand why Jo refuses his marriage proposals, he was her perfect husband. Kirsten Dunst was quite OK like the young Amy, not so well done by  the older Amy, played by Samantha Mathis, who loses the joy and the energy of the young one. Eric Stoltz was incredible, although his role is a very supporting one. Gabriel Byrne was the perfect professor Baerh, he was great, he does perfectly a German accent. Susan Sarandon was brilliant like Marmee, and I think Claire Danes does an inolvidable performance, a bit ignored after the movie was realised. Trini Alvarado  is excellent like Meg. Not only the performances, but all the team that worked in the movie did a great job, the costumes were beautifully designed, the cinematography was brilliant. at least, what I have to say is that this movie has influenced me a lot, all the characters were lovely , the strength of Jo, her dreams of being a writter(I want to be a writer too), her way of think, her beauty,her power. I feel like if I was Laurie lots of times, Laurie is one of the most lovely male characters in the history of literature. And I think this is possible mostly because of Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. I couldn`t imagine a better couple of actors. An incredible and unforgettable movie.</p>
