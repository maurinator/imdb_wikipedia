<h1>Island in the Sun (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set on a fictitious island in the Carribean during colonial British rule, it focuses on the life of a young charismatic and handsome black male with political aspirations. He finds himself confused on returning home when his romantic liaison with a white female tends to conflict with his political views. As rumor has it an interracial screen kiss caused quite a commotion in the U.S. when the film was released. The plot is further strengthened by a look at the lives of a white ex-pat family also living on the island. The family has to deal with problems of infidelity, racism and murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hollywood was clearly not ready for this type of drama, which is full of compromise.  Screen lovers Dorothy Dandridge and John Justin are clearly not allowed to kiss.  Ditto for Joan Fontaine and Harry Belafonte (incidentally, Fontaine's comment about the two of them being children together should have been left out; she looks good, but it's still obvious that she's a good ten years older than he.)</p>
