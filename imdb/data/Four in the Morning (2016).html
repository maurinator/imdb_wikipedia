<h1>Four in the Morning (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>FOUR IN THE MORNING is an unconventional comedy spiked with a touch of magical realism. The show follows four friends in their twenties as they navigate life at the unpredictable, emotional, but illuminative hour of 4 a.m. Dealing with themes of life and death, love and heartbreak, friendship and betrayal, it's a series about self-discovery, disappointment, and clawing after dreams that always feel out of reach.</p>
<p>The world literally and figuratively looks a little different at four in the morning, where the lines between what is real and what is fantasy are often blurred. Residing in Toronto, young adults Mitzi, Jamie, Bondurant and William can often be found at four in the morning hanging out together at their local diner, the Patrician Good Food Grill. That locale is just the jumping off point for the remainder of their evening as they deal with the goings-on in their lives, both together and with the people they may meet in their evening travels. But again, what happens may not always be quite as it seems on the surface because it's four in the morning...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First, "Canadian" is not a knock. Do I need to point this out (cough cough)? Unfortunately, hockey has thus far been the best CanTV. Not saying this is better than hockey, just that calling out something as "Canadian" is not a knock... a knock on us, that is. This show is different ~ but how is that a bad thing (as in a 4.something rating as of now)? The two chicks are good foils; William is a strong straight man to these girls (as in stock character); and Bondurant, well: this character is where performance and strong writing come together to make a show. We've never seen anything like this. Plot, but not arc, driven; performance but not character; post-campy but not clich√©... c'mon!!! Stop dumping on this and someone give us another season.</p>
