<h1>The Immortal Story (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Portuguese colony of Macao in the 19th century. Mr. Clay is a very rich merchant and the subject of town gossip. He has spent many years in China and is now quite old. He likes his clerk Levinsky to read the company's accounts to him at night for relaxation. Tonight Mr. Clay recounts a true story he heard years before about a rich man who paid a poor sailor 5 guineas to father a child with his beautiful young wife. Levinsky says that's a popular old sailor's legend and not true. Mr. Clay has no heir for his fortune and no wife either. He resolves to make the story true... Levinsky approaches Virginie, another clerk's mistress, and strikes a bargain for 300 guineas. Now to find the sailor...</p>
<p>Late nineteenth century Macao. Mr. Clay is an aged wealthy merchant, who is unaware that he is disliked because of his ruthless business dealings and thus largely alone in the world, about which he probably would not care regardless. His only companion is his clerk of seven years, Elishama. Clay believes in history, not in prophesy. During one of Clay and Elishama's evening social sessions together where Elishama generally reads from his accounting records, they discuss a story concerning a wealthy aged businessman, his young wife and a sailor that both have heard, that has largely circulated through the seafaring community, and that they now believe to be an old sailors' tale. As such, Clay wants the story to become a prophesy come true by his doing. He entrusts Elishima with finding a young woman to play his wife, while he himself will find the appropriate sailor within the streets of Macao. His goal is to have the sailor be able to tell the story as it happened to him and thus become a widespread story on reality. Who Elishima finds to play the wife is Virginie, who used to live in the house Clay currently owns and in which she has not been since she was a child. Virginie has her own motives for agreeing despite despising Clay. Similarly, Paul, the young Danish sailor Clay finds, has his own reasons for following Clay. The question becomes if Clay, Virginie, Paul or even Elishima for that matter will come out of the scenario what they wanted going into it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Initially, this film might seem dismayingly disappointing.  Based on an Isak Dinesen novel, it appears not to transcend its literary origins.  Narrative and dialogue are quoted verbatim (and often mumbled or too fast) to accompanying pictures.  The pacing is very slow for a Welles film, with little of his trademark, disruptive editing.  The symbolism seems literary, rather than cinematic.And yet the film is, under this surface, recognisably Wellesian - the old man who has amassed great wealth at the expense of an emotional life, who seeks to control others; the use of storytelling as a metaphor; the idea of the author as a repressive God, who makes his characters conform to his will; the subsequent destruction of the author who uses his power to repress, not express, or create, who does not realise that making a story 'real', in the fatuous hope for immortality, can only mean that the author becomes superfluous; the loyal assistant/friend whose life has been emotionally deadened by the need to serve (and suppress moral qualms about) the great man; the tone of the film, nocturnal, quiet, still, cicadas resounding, suffused with sterility and death.Even the look of the film, seemingly precious and over-formal, is quietly Wellesian (no, not an oxymoron!) - the use of locale as a private labyrinth (there is very little of the Orient here, in spite of attempts at local colour - its anguish is very European and decadent); the idea of the dark, fettered house as a figure for the mind or the soul; the use of found locations, especially old buildings, suggesting older, better, nobler days, also irremovable reminders of decline; the restrained bursts of disruptive editing in the elegant design; the deep-focus long-shots form distorted angles, revealing characters to be mere pawns, geometric shapes in a total, hostile design; the idea of the film being the final dream of a dying man. There is also, in Welles' first non-black-and-white film, a gorgeous use of deep colours.The thrust of the film remains too literary to be a total success, but it is exquisitely beautiful and mournful.  All three characters are locked in typical Wellesian solipsism, all are alone, creating myths and stories to cover up the truth of their own failure to shore against the ruins.  The thwarted possibility of escape only makes the entrapment all the more suffocating.  And yet, there is an otherworldly quality to the central bedroom sequence, aided by Jeanne Moreau's astonishing performance, that raises the film into the realm of the magical.  The rarefied atmosphere of the film is thus entirely appropriate.</p>
