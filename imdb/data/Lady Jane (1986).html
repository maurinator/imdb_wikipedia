<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had to watch this movie for a British History course, and I was fully expecting to be bored during the entire thing, but I was so pleasantly suprised!  This was a great movie - great acting, directing, plot, settings, etc.  And apparently it's a great movie to watch to get a feel for that period in England, 'cause my professor made us watch it.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who has ever watched and enjoyed any period drama before!</p>
