<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched the first IT'S ALIVE movie, and loved it. I was very anxious to see the second film. I waited almost a year, waiting to see this movie that I was sure was going to be as good as the original. Finally, I bought the IT'S ALIVE 2&3 Double Feature DVD. So, I sat back, and played IT LIVES AGAIN.The film takes place a year or so after the first movie. It begins with a couple that is having a baby shower. When everyone leaves, they see that a strange man is in they're house. A man that they don't know. He introduces himself as Frank Davis. The couple recognizes Frank as the man who had the monster baby that they read about. He warns them that they're baby is going to be one of the monster babies. He wants to help them save it, before the government destroys it. Once the baby is born, they take IT, and the father to a place in LA, where they have two other monster babies. But, the government tracks them down, and raids the place looking for the baby. In all the commotion, the three babies escape, and the killing begins once again.The film began very promising and suspenseful, but as the movie went on it went lower and lower until after awhile it was flat out boring. The only way I recommend seeing this film, is if you're a big fan of the original and want to know what happens next.</p>
