<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A version of the classic Shakespeare play performed in Vancouver in 2005.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a video filmed version of the play Hamlet that was performed in Vancouver. I liked it a lot. Especially Megan Morrison as Gertrude and Elias Toufexis as Hamlet. It got some really good reviews too."Elias Toufexis's fresh interpretation of the title role is this Spectral Theatre production's chief pleasure. Toufexis makes a clear decision that Hamlet's apparent madness is a strategic performance. When the ghost of Hamlet's father tells him that he was murdered, this Prince is in such a state of agitated shock that his refusal to relay to Horatio what he has just heard makes sense; the information is too overwhelming to share, too shattering to express or act upon directly.Toufexis turns the familiar verse into credible human speechÂ—sometimes urgent, and sometimes, like when he greets his university chums, downright jocular."-Georgia Straight" Megan Morrison is a star in the making "-IAM</p>
