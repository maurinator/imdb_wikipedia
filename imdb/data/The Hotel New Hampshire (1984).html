<h1>The Hotel New Hampshire (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film talks about a family that weathers all sorts of disasters and keeps going in spite of it all. It is noted for its wonderful assortment of oddball characters.</p>
<p>Mr. Win Berry Berry tries to run rural small town Dairy's high-school and his sassy family. The troubles of his sons Frank, a gay bullied by team idolized football captain Chip Dove, horny athlete John and 'Egg', so called after his growth-stopping syndrome, and daughters, inspire him to try running a hotel instead. After more problems, they accept a shady offer to run a Viennese hotel, but that proves a run-down rat-hole and terrorist layer, where disaster lays in waiting. Offspring talents also open positive avenues, which also prove mixed blessing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't believe no one ever bothered writing about this wonderful film. Though it is in many way American  most cast and the author of the book on which the book is based are American  but this is one of the least American films I know. It is so European  the director, the locale that is half the time Europe  and the very daring subject matters simply make this a real gem. It is a story of a family with the oddest characters and the most horrible disasters. And yet they persevere. `Keep Passing the Open Windows"  the motto that represents both danger of suicide and hope.It is funny, sad, emotional and insightful. The course of events may be too quick for some, but as in life  it's so very unexpected. I love `The World According to Garp' as well, as movie and book and these two share a lot in common. And how can anyone resist watching a film with such a wonderful cast  Rob Lowe, Jodie Foster, Paul McCrane, Beau Bridges, Wallace Shawn, Matthew Modine, Wilford Brimley, Nastassja Kinski and Amanda Plummer And Rob Lowe and Jodie Foster never looked cuter. The story spans many years and places, and would touch on subject matters such as raising children, music, incest, homosexuality, communism, psychology, terrorism, writing, racism, hotel management and the recurring subjects with John Irving  at least in what I read  airplanes and bears (see Garp again for these too).A film that leaves you with a feeling of hope and a wish that you also knew these wonderful people.  Don't miss it.</p>
