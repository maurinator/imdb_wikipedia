<h1>2LDK (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nozomi and Lana share an apartment in Tokyo. They have both auditioned for the same role in a movie, and know that the shortlist has been cut down to just the two of them. As they wait the night before finding out who will get the role, their personality clashes erupt into an all-out battle.</p>
<p>Two actresses who have auditioned for one part, sharing the same apartment with opposite personalities equals a night which either neither of them will forget - if they survive!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are into absurd, dark humoured comedies, you will more than enjoy this. One part of the "Dual Project", this is more entertaining than the other story (Aragami). While Kitamura seemed to have just done a light version of his (good) movie Versus, this has a few things going for it. Both have the same basic idea. Two actors (or actresses in this case) in one room.And what happens from there, is up to the individual director. But let's say it's not something the faint-hearted will like or enjoy. But as I stated above, if you are a fan, than you will be delighted by quite a few things. It has a fast pace, some funny dialogue and just enough of everything else. If you watch it with Aragami, make sure this is the second movie you'll watch!</p>
