<h1>Awakening of the Beast (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During a debate of journalists with the renowned psychiatrist Dr. Sérgio and José Mojica Marins a.k.a. Zé do Caixão, Sr. Sérgio presents several cases of kinky sex and orgy associated to the use of drugs. The journalists defend that the cases are related to perverts and criminals, but Dr. Sérgio blames the influence of drugs for the violence. Then Dr. Sérgio invites four persons from different classes to use LSD and analyze the effect of Zé do Caixão's films in their twisted minds to prove his theory.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist experiments LSD on 4 volunteers, to investigate Coffin Joe's influence over them. Each patient presents a different reaction, involving sex, perversion and sadism.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is by far one of the most bizarre films I've seen, and I'm familiar with the works of Jodorowsky and Lynch. It's certainly not Jose Mojica Marins' most accessible film (the two proceeding Coffin Joe films are recommended as better starting places for the novice). However, it is his best, when all of his sub-Neitschze philosophy, violence, and common hatred for authority came together. Sure, its a bit of a mess as far as film-making goes, but its a fascinating mess nonetheless. Its an interesting parable on how the government uses scapegoats such as drugs and violent cinema (particularly that of Marins' films which were subjected to much censorship) to cover up other issues. For its subversive story, it was banned in Brazil until 1986.Marins was always a talented if raw filmmaker. His roughie segments at the beginning are disturbing and even gross, but they contribute to the power of the film. The final LSD sequence is one of the most amazing ever caught on film. The trip sequence is comprised of censored scenes from earlier Coffin Joe films and new footage. Viewing this, its no wonder the government was horrified and called for it to be banned. In his homeland, Marins is a renowned cult figure. Unfortuantly his unique cinema isn't appreciated too much outside of Brazil. This is a shame, because while his films aren't for everybody, psychotronic fans will love them. (8/10)</p>
