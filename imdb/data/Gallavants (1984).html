The plot follows the adventures of Shando, a young GIT, who only wants to be a music-ant. Between Antonim and the villainous VanterViper, Shando has all four of his "habs" full from start to finish. Gallavants sports 14 memorable songs with intelligent theatrical lyrics everyone is sure to enjoy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I was younger, Gallavants was my favorite movie. I could watch it over and over. The characters had amazing and detailed personalities and they seemed to come alive. I think the best part about the movie is that these characters face issues of their own that real people cannot experience. This lets the characters provide lessons in friendship and ways to deal with problems, and even a bit of optimism, but the children don't need to worry about experiencing the same problems and being afraid as they might in a movie with real-life situations. Although, I remember asking my mom where my ca-bump was. All together, with realistic characters, good songs, and memorable events, this is a wonderful movie. Unfortunately, not many video stores carry it anymore.</p>
