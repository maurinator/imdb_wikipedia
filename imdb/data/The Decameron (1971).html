<h1>The Decameron (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An adaptation of nine stories from Bocaccio's "Decameron": A young man from Perugia is swindled twice in Naples, but ends up rich; a man poses as a deaf-mute in a convent of curious nuns; a woman must hide her lover when her husband comes home early; a scoundrel fools a priest on his deathbed; three brothers take revenge on their sister's lover; a young girl sleeps on the roof to meet her boyfriend at night; a group of painters wait for inspiration; a crafty priest attempts to seduce his friend's wife; and two friends make a pact to find out what happen= s after death. Pasolini is up to his old tricks satirizing the Church, and throwing in liberal doses of life and love.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pasolini's films are not for everyone. They are slow moving and play on archetypes, but I can think of no one who captures myth as well he does in his `Trilogy of Life' (The Decameron, The Arabian Nights, and The Canterbury Tales). Pasolini does as delicious job of weaving the mythical and poetic into everyday life. He uses real people instead of actors, and presents sexuality innocently and sensually. Staying away from the sexual violence so common in films of this era, and the soft porn haze we see in Hollywood films today. These universal stories are presented much the way they were written, simply and earnestly. The effect for me has always been pure magic.</p>
