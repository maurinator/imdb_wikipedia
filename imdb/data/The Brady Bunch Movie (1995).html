<h1>The Brady Bunch Movie (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mike Brady and his wife Carol Brady have just only one week to come up with $20,000 in back taxes or their house is sold and they'll have no choice but to move. And it's up to the Brady kids to secretly raise money and save the homestead before they lose their house to their scheming neighbor Mr. Larry Dittmeyer.</p>
<p>Picks up the Brady clan and plops them down in the 1990s, with their original naivete intact. Mr. Dittmeyer, the Brady's next door neighbor, is in charge of acquiring land for a new residential mini-mall, and the Bradys are the last hold-outs on selling their land. Unbeknownst to the Bradys, Dittmeyer has also been receiving, and concealing, their mail, which includes overdue notices on property taxes. $20,000 is necessary to save the Brady house from auction, and when the kids find out, they secretly go about raising money to save the homestead.</p>
<p>It's the 90's and even the Bradys get the blues. Mike and Carol have just one week to come up with $20,000 before their house is sold to their scheming neighbor Larry Dittmeyer. To make matters worse, Marcia gets a swollen nose on prom night, Cindy is addicted to tattling, and Jan is hearing a psychotic inner voice crying, "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!"</p>
<p>The original '70s T.V. family is now placed in the 1990s, where they're even more square and out of place than ever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For anyone old enough to have seen the original series, this movie truly blows the lid off of the whole TV show and pokes fun at the whole whole family and concept at every turn. They easily could have done a formula tv-ish movie and instead they make a complete parody that is screamingly funny. Not to mention that the fact that the cast are dead-ringers for the originals--in fact Jan is so _frighteningly_ like the original that it'll send shivers up your back. Four of the original cast also make cameos in the film (but you'll have to really look to find some of them), and the film blends the whole campy concept with the "retro" plastic nineties--a perfect joke on fashions of this decade. Very worth watching!</p>
