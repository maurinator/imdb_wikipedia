<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All of Me is one of the funniest of the Steve Martin movies. He and Lily Tomlin are matched perfectly for the zany antics that occur in the quest for her spirit to be united with the body of Victoria Tennant. Watch for the opening scenes where Martin tries to control his side of his body as Tomlin controls the other side. The resulting attempts to walk will have you rolling in the aisles. The time that Martin and Tomlin share his body are filled with moments including her having to "tap tap" in the men's room and him wanting her to have erotic thoughts while he is about to have sex with Tennant. Of course her thinking of Clark Gable does nothing for him. The music and the sight gags are all great. A perfectly crafted film. You will not be disappointed. This movie is one of my all time favorite funny movies.</p>
