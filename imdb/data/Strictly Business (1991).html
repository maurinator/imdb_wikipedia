<h1>Strictly Business (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fun-loving Bobby is a mail boy in a big firm, but he has a trump card, his best friend Waymon, a "white" African-American who is almost a partner in the firm. They make a deal: Waymon will try to move Bobby to the trainee broker programme if he will help him meet Natalie, the girl of his dreams. There's only one problem, everyone will have to change...</p>
<p>Sharp social satire in which the uneven friendship between an ambitious black businessman and his streetwise pal is thrown into still more confusion when the professional falls in love with a mind-numbingly gorgeous waitress.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good clean movie with a message. They don't make them like this anymore. This movie reminds me of a later movie Mo Money!, though more for comedy with the Wayman brothers still clean and fun to watch. I gave this movie a 10 for entertainment value.</p>
