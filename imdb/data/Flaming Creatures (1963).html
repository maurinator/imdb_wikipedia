<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I consider myself a fairly open-minded person.  In principle I have nothing against a movie featuring a pack of transvestites frolicking around and--this is what it looks like--acting out parodies of bad silent movies. It's just not all that interesting to me.  I can only take camp in small doses, and there's just way too much here.  By the way, did the Everly Brothers even know one of their songs was used in this thing?  (P.S. If you ever see Warhol's "Screen Test #2," you'll hear Mario Montez talk briefly about his (her?) role in this movie.)</p>
