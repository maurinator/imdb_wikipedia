A confusing flash back structure from a murder trial shows his fickle paranoia, jealousy and arrogance can bring him no booty. He's even too insignificant for major charges.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Thruth and fiction blend in a fun and in some places gross story about the most known criminal of Australia, Mark "Chopper" Reed. Now, I am not Australian, nor have I read Choppers books, so I really can't say how accurate this movie is to towards it's sources but what I can say it does work quite well as a movie.And as it is stated in the film, the story isn't a salute towards crime, so it doesn't try to be truthful to the maxChopper (Eric Bana) is a man with a dream: to become most notorious man of Australia. This he tries to achieve by doing crimes, looting and murders but not drugs. He also exaggerates his stories, so no-one actually knows what he has done and in what extent. This give possibilities to tell same stuff from the point of view of other occupants.Good film, mostly because of brilliant acting by Bana. Defintly his best movie (as an actor) to date.</p>
