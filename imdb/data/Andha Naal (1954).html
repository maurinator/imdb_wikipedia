<h1>Andha Naal (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The night after the Japanese bombing of Madras, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan) a radio engineer, is murdered while preparing to leave town with a bag full of cash. A police detective Sivanandan (Jaavar Seetharaman) investigates the case and finds each of his suspects coming up with a different retelling of the events of the night of the murder. A brisk, atmospheric film, brilliant for its time and given that it was made in the constraints of the Madras studio system that experimented with little outside of mythological epics and social dramas.</p>
<p>After an engineer is shot dead, several people around him relate different versions and the related incidents that may have led to the murder.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If i have to select the best 5 tamil films ever made , this will be one among them. For the sheer novelty in story telling, daring to exclude the songs - a mandatory in those days-,electrifying performance from that man Shivaji ganesan,unforgettable climax, this film is a gem.The story is about a brilliant engineer who betrays his country by selling its military secrets to enemy state ,and getting murdered in mysterious circumstance.The detective interrogates the relatives and friends and find each one of them has motive to kill the man. The climax is a truly surprising one,a sign of all those good mystery movies.What makes this movie stand apart from the rest is, the stylish story telling where the audience is shown the same incident from each character's version.Inspired by ROSHOMON,this movie is a milestone in Indian cinema. Credit should be given to Shivaji for taking the role of Anti-hero and doing it with his own style and grace.A must for all who love movies with style and difference.</p>
