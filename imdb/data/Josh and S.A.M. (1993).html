On the run from cops and other people, Josh and Sam realize life at home was better.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Josh and SAM" is one of those films that is strangely humorous, in the sense that it really isn't supposed to be all that funny.The premise-- that two pre-teens steal a car to run away from home (because the younger is actually a robot... or something to that effect) and then end up picking up Martha Plimpton, who refers to herself as "The Liberty Maid" or something-- is just so gloriously bizarre that you find yourself laughing without knowing why.But the real clincher for this film's humor is that SAM, the technologically-enhanced younger boy, spends almost half of this film with a "feminine hygiene product" attached to his forehead b/c he couldn't find a real Band-Aid. If that isn't comedy, I'm not sure what is...Rating: 7 out of 10. A prime example of absurdist film-making, although I'm not sure that was the purpose here. Regardless, it's brainless fun that demands a great deal of analysis-- so you'll understand WHY you're laughing at this movie, when you know that you shouldn't be.</p>
