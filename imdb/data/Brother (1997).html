<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie with alot of violence.  Throughout the movie there are long stretches of Danila making explosives, sawing off a shot gun, and fashioning weapons, with Nau music playing.  The rest of the movie consists mainly of him using these weapons at his job as a hitman.  Make no mistake, there is depth to this film.  It is more than an excuse to show violence.Danila is an interesting character.  At the ame time he blows away people regularly with no remorse and little thought.  Its his job, may as well do it well. I watched this as part of a film series at college in the original Russian, and the group of Russians sitting behind me laughed at many points.  The laughter confused me a bit, but the second time I saw it was pretty funny, and not in the usual one liner sense of action movies.  I especially liked the part where Danila asks if he can copy the director√ïs Nau CD.I highly recommend this film for people who either like random violence or can tolerate it for the sake of an interesting plot.  The film has a distinctive feel to it.</p>
