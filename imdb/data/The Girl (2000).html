Words like 'prostitute' and 'pimp' seem too harsh for the sexy-smooth atmosphere of this fascinating look at obsessive love.</p>
<p>A torrid affair between two women, a struggling artist and a flame-haired blues singer, upsets a man who has a thing for the girl.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Highly stylized this film comes close of being surrealistic, but won't go any further than surreal.Most people do not talk in this film, and all except two are clichés: ruffians, harlots, macho's, babes.Which two ? AHA, now we're getting somewhere.Two beautiful women go through life as tropical fish in an aquarium: the whole world notices them, watches them, gazes upon them. Yet they feel invulnerable, feeling protected by their own cocoon, the glass of the fishbowl.Time in this film adapts to this aquarium-in-the-middle-of-the-world feeling: it floats and is no bother at all for the two wonderful ladies. I haven't seen such a lovely soft-paced film in a long time !But of course, doom must creep in. This is the world, or in this case: Paris, we're talking about ! Sheer beauty is intolerable for the human race, it has to be soiled. Even in a city as gorgeous as Paris, which is displayed here with picture-postcard beauty.The silent cliché people start to tap and knock on the glass of the aquarium. One of the beauties keeps floating on majestically; the other rubs her nose to the glass and interacts with the 'others' outside the bowl.The inevitable happens: the bowl cracks, symbolized in the film by the harsh lights of a car beaming straight into the lens. Time seeps in and becomes a burden ! Violence sets in, and although the women keep on feeling safe for a while longer, in the end the aquarium will be shattered.An intriguing film, excitingly acted by the two protagonists, the incredible Claire Keim and the enigmatic Agathe de la Boulaye. Not in a natural way, some Japanese theater-style of acting has been blend in.Well worth your attention !!! And your appreciation !!</p>
