<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Three of the greatest (and dirtiest) comedians ever together in this one movie. Funny, hilarious, yes at bit off color with the many uses of the f word but still a great movie with a nice sting at the end. Get over the F word! If you haven't seen this movie in a while, go back and watch it. The first time I watched it, I was lukewarm about it. Now I go back and watch it, grateful that it was made especially since the passing of Richard Pryor (and Redd Foxx). If you haven't heard any of their stand up, go listen. It's awesome. Richard Pryor is the best. My only complaint is that Arsenio Hall's character was stupid.</p>
