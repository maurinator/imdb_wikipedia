<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had been vaguely interested in seeing this film for a while before I got down to it, for the prospect of a film directed by Michael Crighton (RIP), starring Tom Selleck and Gene Simmons and featuring evil spider robots was very inviting to me. It is pretty fun, but never reaches the heights it could do. Selleck plays a cop who suffers from vertigo and has the job of diffusing robots that have gone astray. His job mostly involves stopping runaway farming robots or misfiring security drones, but unfortunately someone has got a hold of micro chips that can make robots turn evil. So, Selleck and his partner, ably played by Cynthia Rhodes get on the case and find themselves up against a malign Gene Simmons. Selleck can do this sort of thing in his sleep and is effortlessly convincing, whilst Simmons plays a bad guy pretty well. Sadly the film is underwritten and has a few plot holes as well as lacking any real sense of emergency. The effects are pretty nice mid 80's stuff and the robots are well made, especially the spider robots that are a tad underused, apart from the cool finale. There are some good action sequences and the film has a swell pace, but somehow its just never that impressive. It sorely needed more violence, more intensity, or at the very least better writing, with the scenes dealing with Selleck's home life absolutely horrible. There isn't much in the way of characterisation, but Crighton does at least handle the action well and there are at least two decent set pieces. Altogether, this is worth a look for robot movie buffs or 80's nostalgia fans and its easygoing good fun, but definitely no classic.</p>
