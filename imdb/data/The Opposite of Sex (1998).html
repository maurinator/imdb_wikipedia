<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is about a disturbed teenage girl wrecking up everyone's lives around her.The plot portrays Dedee's antisocial and unstable behaviour well. Dedee's character is developed so well that it is easy for people to dislike her. Christina Ricci's performance is great as usual. Lisa Kudrow is also good in her role as Bill's supportive best friend. There are indeed laughs as well, there are many jokes that work in the film. The "Mr I will pull out" joke really got me laughing! The hospital scene towards the is touching and affecting. That scene is the only time Dedee means what she says, and she says it with much sincerity and emotion. Great film, I recommend it!</p>
