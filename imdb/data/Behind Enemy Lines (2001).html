<h1>Behind Enemy Lines (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fighter navigator Chris Burnett wants out: he was looking for something more than the boring recon missions he's been flying. He finds himself flying the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.</p>
<p>Lt. Chris Burnett has lost faith in his job in the Navy and wants to get out, and is even forced to do a reconnaissance mission with his friend Lt. Jeremy Stackhouse over Bosnia. During the mission, they fly their jet off course to check out a suspicious target that turns out to be the site of a mass grave that contains bodies of Bosnian Muslims. The main perpetrator of the massacre, Gen. Miroslav Lokar, has the plane shot down in order to avoid having the plane obtaining evidence of the massacre. Stackhouse ends up getting killed, while Burnett finds himself alone on the run from Lokar's ruthless soldiers. Burnett's commanding officer, Rear Admiral Leslie Reigart, has trouble gaining approval from his own commanding officers to carry out a search-and-rescue mission to save Burnett. From encountering a major battle in a war-torn town, to mine fields, to Serb soldiers seeking the pilot, and to a highly skilled sniper, will Burnett be able to escape Bosnia, or will he suffer the same fate of his comrade?</p>
<p>A Navy navigator is shot down over enemy territory and is ruthlessly pursued by a secret police enforcer and the opposing troops. Meanwhile his commanding officer goes against orders in an attempt to rescue him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I ask you! What US Navy pilot and navigator would stray/depart from their assigned flight plan ? especially if it were a no-fly zone? Not one.If you were on the run being chased by an army trying to kill you, would you stop and sit on the concrete levee of a reservoir in plain sight? An idiot that deserves to get killed.What trained serviceman would come out blazing holding his firearm sideways in his hand like a cowboy instead of with both hands and squarely in front of him? John Wayne, Sly Stallone, ArnoldAnd finally, who could survive running straight back into enemy fire to retrieve a CD-ROM? John Wayne, Sly ?Why did the Bosnian tanks not fire at the escape helicopters? Was it just me or did some of the Bosnians look like a toy army in the final explosion?How disappointing! I was all ready for a good really based war movie. Sure the basic premise was good and the cause was noble, but the action was inconceivable. The movie trailers I saw that day included Black Hawk Down. Knowing the real story made me weep and angry. What a dark day in our military history! Let?s hope they do not screw-up that one too. If you hear anything about those brave soldiers being rescued ? skip that one too.</p>
