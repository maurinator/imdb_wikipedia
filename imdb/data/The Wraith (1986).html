<h1>The Wraith (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Packard Walsh and his motorized gang control and terrorize an Arizona desert town where they force drivers to drag-race so they can 'win' their vehicles. After Walsh stabs the decent teenager Jamie Hankins to death for being intimate with a girl whom Walsh wants for himself, the mysterious Jake Kesey arrives, an extremely cool motor-biker with an invincible car. Jake befriends Jamie's girlfriend Keri Johnson, takes Jamie's sweet brother Billy under his wing and manages what Sheriff Loomis can not - the methodical and otherworldly elimination of Packard's criminal gang.</p>
<p>A small desert town has been harassed for months by a gang of drag racers, but so far no one has done anything to stop them. One day, a ghostly black car shows up, challenging members of the group to race, then killing them one by one. Neither the gang nor the police can catch the car or its driver, but some investigating into the gang's past may reveal just who's behind all this.</p>
<p>A mysterious figure suddenly appears to challenge a gang of motorhead thugs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My brothers and I used to watch this movie all the time, probably when it was on HBO back in the day. It was a nice piece of nostalgia. Since I had viewed it so much as a kid, it was like going back and watching a movie you almost know by heart but at the same time weren't really sure what was going to happen next.The soundtrack was great, with the likes of Ozzy, Billy Idol, Robert Palmer and others. Looking at all that 80's "fashion" was fun too. The DVD box didn't say the year but I had determined it to be about '86 or '87.I couldn't help but draw a comparison to this storyline and that of "The Crow". "The Crow" is definitely a darker piece of fun but the same "guy done wrong takes revenge and finds his girl" wasn't hard to miss.All in all, if you're looking for something fun, with a great soundtrack, cool cars and fast car races, check it out!</p>
