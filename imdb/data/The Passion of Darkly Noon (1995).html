<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After the death of his strictly religious parents, forlorn young Darkly gets lost in the woods. A truck driver, Jude, rescues the exhausted man, who has only a bible for comfort. He brings him to the house of Callie and Clay, two lovers who live in the forest. While Clay is away in the forest, beautiful Callie nurses Darkly back to health, and he develops an obsession with her that is totally contrary to his upbringing - a sexual obsession. When Clay returns home and Darkly sees the two lovers kiss, it is too much for him. Every night he hears them making love. Darkly's descent into madness has begun... An extremely dramatical and exciting ending!</p>
<p>While driving through the forest to the isolated house of the lovers Callie and Clay, the driver Jude finds a young man fainted on the road. He rescues the stranger and the sensual Callie welcomes him while Clay is retired in the woods. When he awakes, he tells his name, Darkly Noon, and explains that his religious parents had been killed in their house by the furious locals and he had successfully escaped with his bible. Clay returns and accepts the presence of the new-comer in his house. Along the next days, Darkly becomes sexually obsessed by the sexy Callie and uses flagellation to punish himself for his desire. When the confused Darkly meets the deranged widow Roxy in the woods, she tells him that Callie is a witch that killed her husband and that bewitches young men. When Roxy commits suicide, the insanity of the fanatic Darkly leads him to punish the sinners.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this film there's all the ingredients for a good thriller. And, above all, movie making that feels fresh. Striking editing, good music, fine acting and excellent direction (by Philip Ridley, a name I'll keep in mind).The reason I saw the film in the first place - Viggo Mortensen has a supporting role as mute husband to the nymph (Ashley Judd). Brendan Fraser shows that he doesn't only can play the handsome young man. He does a phenomenal role portrait in the difficult title role.Darkly Noon is an unpredictable film that surely haven't got the audience and critique it deserves. It made me think of such films as  _Shining, The (1980)_(qv) and _Enfaldige m√∂rdaren, Den (1982)_(qv).</p>
