<h1>Exit to Eden (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Elliot is going to the island of Eden to live out his submissive fantasies, but inadvertently photographs diamond smugglers at work. Smugglers, and detectives, follow him to the island, where they try to retrieve the film. Elliot begins falling in love with Lisa, the head mistress of the island, and Lisa must evaluate her feelings about Elliot and her own motivations.</p>
<p>Troubled by his own repressed sexuality, Elliot embarks on a trip to an island of libertinage and sexual release, not realising he has become the target for a criminal's vendetta. Two cops are close behind, and have to go deep undercover to discover what's going on amongst the submission and bondage - and Elliot's growing love for Mistress Lisa.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Completely misbegotten adaptation of Anne Rice's book about two cops (Dan Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell, a screen-teaming which should've been a hoot) working undercover at an S&M resort to capture a ring of crooks. Garry Marshall directed in a shamefully sloppy manner, without a clue as to how a general audience would feel about this kind of material; his narrative is so clogged with smarmy activity and failed gimmicks (like a voice-over from O'Donnell that is both unfunny and unnecessary) that the picture self-destructs even before the opening credits have finished! Highly unpleasant dud was a critical and commercial turkey, although O'Donnell has gotten mileage out of it by making "Exit to Eden" jokes at her own expense.</p>
