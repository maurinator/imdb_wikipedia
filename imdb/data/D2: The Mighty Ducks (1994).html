<h1>D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gordon Bombay is forced to withdraw from the minor hockey league with a knee injury. Much to his surprise, he is given the job of coach of Team USA Hockey for the Junior Goodwill Games in California. With most of the Ducks and a few new players in tow, he sets forth for LA. All appears to be going well for a while, but the hype of Hollywood starts to get to Gordon, and he is distracted when Iceland, the favourites to win the title, appear on the scene.</p>
<p>After hurting his knee in an accident in the minor leagues, Gordon Bombay returns home. Jan has been promoting him as a good coach, and now, he has become the coach of Team USA. The Ducks are gathered again and joined by five new players- Dean Portman (a big enforcer), Ken Wu (an ex-figure skater), Julie Gaffney (a REALLY good goalie), Luis Mendoza (a "speedster"), and Dwyane Robertson (a cowboy, good puck handler). They are up against the world- including the big boys from Iceland. Can they win against the world?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the first Mighty Ducks film, it was uplifting and fun. And you know what, I liked this film too. It is blander than the first, with the direction lacking in places, the plot predictable and the pacing a little uneven. However, the ice hockey matches are done with real flair, the soundtrack is great, it is well filmed and the script actually has its touching and humorous moments. Emilio Estevez reprises his role as Gordon and does a very good job again, in fact he could very well be the actor who holds the film together, and Kathryn Erbe is a charming Michele. Overall, don't expect a masterpiece, but this is an enjoyable film if given a chance. 7/10 Bethany Cox</p>
