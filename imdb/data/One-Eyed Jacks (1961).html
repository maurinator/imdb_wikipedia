<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is essential viewing for Brando fans. Brando directs for the only time . Working from a script that is in part based on the legend of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, Brando interweaves themes of betrayal, revenge and hypocrisy into something strangely hypnotic and real. Particularly effective in this respect is the scene with Karl Malden and Brando on the outskirts of Monterey where the two sit reminiscing amusingly about their past together and the viewer is left wondering if at any moment the two of them might end up blowing each others heads off. The other key to this film is setting it on the west coast of California thereby giving it a feel and rhythm that is unique to the western genre. All in all a greatly neglected treasure.</p>
