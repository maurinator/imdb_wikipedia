<h1>12 Years a Slave (2015)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>KG and Ringy are in Louisiana, on the trail of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped in the 1840s and sold into slavery. Solomon chronicled his ordeal in his autobiography, "12 Years A Slave," which was made into a movie 160 years later. No artifacts remain from his time in captivity and few from slaves in general, so the boys have teamed up with two of Solomon's descendants to help bring light to this dark time in history.</p>
