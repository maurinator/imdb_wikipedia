<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen this movie several times and each time i appreciate Jimmy Stewart more and more. Jimmy Stewart is at his best in this film..tough and tender witty and sarcastic..idealistic and true to his values......i wont rehash all the details, enough to say if you a JS fan you will love the movie, if you a Civil war reanactor, you might not. Its well worth the time to view. Try not to be too harsh on the Production values and costuming here. There are plenty of Civil War movies for those of you who want those fine details. Try and pay attention to the story and Stewarts performance. Also notable are the performances of James Best, George Kennedy and the first screen role for Katherine Ross.</p>
