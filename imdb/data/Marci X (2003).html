<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saw this yesterday after work because I thought the story had a chance to be funny, boy how wrong I was.  I have NO IDEA how Paramount actaully thought this was a good movie.  I've seen better films at work about safety training.  If you think about going to see this movie don't waste your time take the 90 minutes and go down to a local charity and volunteer your time. Mark this down this film will be on the list as one of the worst films of 2003, if not at the top of the list.  Terrible, unfunny movie.</p>
