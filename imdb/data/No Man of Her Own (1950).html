<p>In a mansion in Caulfield, Illinois, Patrice Harkness and Bill Harkness are waiting for the police. Meanwhile, she recalls her life in San Francisco. The eight-month pregnant Helen Ferguson is dumped by her boyfriend, the crook Stephen 'Steve' Morley, who gives a train ticket to her to New York to stay with his new girlfriend. In the train, Helen befriends the also pregnant Patrice Harkness and her husband Hugh Harkness that are returning from Europe. When they go to the toilet, Patrice asks Helen to hold her wedding ring to avoid losing it, but there is an accident and only Helen survives. She is mistaken by the Hatkness family as being Patrice and welcomed by Mrs. Harkness, Mr. Harkness and Bill at home. Helen decides to pose of Patrice thinking in the future of her baby Hugh and the family treats her like a daughter. Out of the blue, Steve meets Helen in a club and blackmails her, promising to destroy the lives to Mr. and Mrs. Harkness. Now Helen realizes that she must kill Steve to protect her son and the old couple. What will she do?</p>

The rich Harkness in-laws, and their other son Bill, had never seen Patrice, so they accept her and her newborn son into their family. However Steve eventually finds her and starts to blackmail her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am a huge fan of Barbara Stanwyck. I have seen everything from her earliest pictures like "The Miracle Woman" to her swansong in the perfectly dreadful TV series "The Colbys". Ms. Stanwyck to me is probably the greatest of the "classic" era actresses. She is fine in this film, masterfully directed by Mitchell Leisen. This film has a compelling story, full of unexpected twists. It also has a fine supporting cast, with Jane Cowl a standout in a sympathetic part as a recently bereaved mother. The film is classic noir with some fine touches in the direction. There is a scene where a character is being wheeled into a hospital surgery filmed from the viewpoint of the person on the gurney. Another great touch comes when Ms. Stanwyck meets up with someone she'd rather not see at a party, and the music playing in the background takes on a wild, almost maniacal tone. I had never heard of this film before, and it's not out on DVD, but it is streaming in an excellent print on Netflix.</p>
