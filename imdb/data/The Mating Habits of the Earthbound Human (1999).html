<h1>The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An anthropologist from an alien planet provides voice-over commentary for a documentary look at human courtship, mating, and reproduction: "complex, perverse, tragically beautiful: the earthbound human." The commentary gets some of the details comically wrong (explaining the slap on a newborn's back: "they don't like the looks of the child so they beat it"), but gets right the overall idea. We follow Billy and Jenny from their meeting at a club, initial misunderstandings, his losing her phone number, finally connecting, walks on the beach, soulful talks, meeting each other's parents, friends' advice, and the gradual taking of the relationship to new levels.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this at about 1:00 AM one morning. My channel surfing was naturally halted by Carmen dancing at a Disco.  The surprising and amusing voice-over of many time Emmy winner, David Hyde Pierce, was also quite an attention getter.  What followed was a pretty likeable, playful, and occasionally laugh out loud (sperm runners) spoof of the American dating moors.  The male lead nicely portrayed an "average guy" in over his head with the stunning Carmen Electra.  Her performance here was so easy and unforced, than, along with a couple of late night talk show appearance I've seen recently (namely Craig Kilborn), have really made me a big fan. Don't get the Dennis Rodman thing, but.....?  The sex scenes, though tame, had a nice playful spirit, and except for a totally out of character, unnecessary tirade during the childbirth sequence, the movie could have been suitable, and probably appreciated, by a younger audience.  Considering what must have been a fairly low-budget, a nice debut by the director.  Give it a watch!!</p>
