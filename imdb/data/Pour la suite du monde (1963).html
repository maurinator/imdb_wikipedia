<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At the instigation of the filmmakers, the young men of the Ile-aux-Coudres in the middle of the St-Lawrence River try as a memorial to their ancestors to revive the fishing of the belugas interrupted in 1924.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a testimony of an era that is almost vanished, with all its beautiful and raw truth. Even among the elders of Québec, very few today could actually fully understand typical expressions and language of Île aux Coudres inhabitants. But anyone paying attention to the music of time, and to the true nature of life, will be moved by the quest of these villagers, by their consciousness of the tragedy of cultural death. This story is the one of their last battle, their last attempt to revive something that will soon be forgotten, even by their own children. Some believe in it, other seem discouraged. In the end, what is left of their message is the crucial moment when they realize that what they do is part of an effort to leave something "POUR LA SUITE DU MONDE". This film is a masterpiece, a treasure that should be kept forever, to teach the world how to not forget.</p>
