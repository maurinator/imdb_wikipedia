<h1>Galaxina (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Main Plot: Crew of interstellar police ship is sent to recover a mysterious crystal, the Blue Star. Subplots: The ship's female android and a crew member fall in love. Alien is spoofed as as the captain gives birth to an alien who grows up on the ship thinking the captain is its mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dorothy Stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci-fi spoof, and her appearance is a disappointment.  Though she has the title role, her screentime is limited, and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue.  If you're not a Stratten fan, pass this one up.</p>
