<h1>Caresses (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eleven episodes portray different encounters in a large city during the course of a single night towards the end of the millennium. A young man wants to stop living together with a young woman because he believes that they no longer have anything to say to each other. The young woman goes to visit her mother, an elderly woman. She lives with an old lesbian who meets her homeless brother. She asks him to forgive her for having seduced his wife all those years ago, but the brother pretends not to know who she is. A young boy attacks the homeless man. At first he tells him about his wild nights, then he knocks him to the ground and steals the old man's ring. At home the young boy has a bath and asks his father to join him in the tub. The boy's father has a girlfriend, a young woman. He intends to end their relationship... Eleven interlocking scenes that involve two characters, one of whom carries forward into the next scene, until the chain comes full circle.</p>
<p>Barcelona is the scenario for eleven entwined stories sharing the same characters. The movie deals with a variety of intimate relationships, portraying characters who have to experience intense emotions which cannot be materialized in caresses. Connections explored include several different family and romantic relationships across different genders, ages and generations. A recurring theme is the irony of how difficult communication can be, even when there is close contact. Partial expression, instincts vs. emotions and physical communication all play a part.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Carícies" claims to be an adaptation of a famous catalan theatre play by Sergi Belbel. Once seen the film, and also read the play, I can't believe how much successful the film was. The critics loved it and I wonder why. Director Ventura Pons has found the phormula for instant success: filming an acclaimed play or book (as he did in "El perquè de tot plegat/ El porqué de las cosas", "Actrius"...). Motion pictures are suposed to be an art, not just a book or a famous play shot in 35 mm. In "Carícies", director Ventura Pons, uses the dialogues of the play almost word by word and his job consists on add music and a few continuity shots inserted among each scene. The plot (if there's is any) is very weak, as often occurs when adapting a character-based play. That's the case. And that's the problem. Pons is surrounded by few good actors but they seem undirected, and they act on their way. There is no sense of direction anywhere. No intentions, not a single idea on the screen. Ventura Pons is a smart producer but unoperative as a story-teller. "Carícies" has no soul, no blood. Just filmed words. And for me, this is not cinema.</p>
