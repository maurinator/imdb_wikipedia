<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've heard it said, "This is not repeat not a chick flick."Wrong.  I loved this film.  I was impressed by the way the film dealt with personal relationships.  Yeah - get worried, fellas, because one of the main themes is about how guys deal with losing guy friends.  It's also about how guys deal with keeping guy friends, but I won't bore you...If it makes you feel any better, there's a scene in a bar that involves a zipwire and a mudpit with an alligator, and some cool flight stuff that includes 'how to make the new non-pilot sick.'Didn't have a 'chick' problem with it, which is probably why I'm so proud of my hardbound copy of "Baa Baa Black Sheep" autographed by Pappy Boyington. Don't count the women out when you watch this film.  It has its clunker moments, but they are few, and thankfully they don't occur in the air.Politically insightful in spots, and for the most part, a good two hours spent.  Seriously, this is a good movie; do see it.</p>
