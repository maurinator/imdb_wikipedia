<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>are usually the ones with plots of their own.  This one is such a spoof and it is very funny.  You don't have to see any movies to find this funny either.  You just have to have seen parts of an Elvis movie over the years or saw a scene or two from an old espionage flick.  You don't have to watch an entire movie to get the jokes.  Val Kilmer is very funny here as is all the cast.  The jokes are great even with some of them being a bit dated.  The resistance group is great, the escape, everything in here is really funny.  After "Airplane" this one ranks right up there with the best spoof movies made.</p>
