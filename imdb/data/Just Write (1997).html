<h1>Just Write (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harold is a tour bus driver. While visiting a good friend in a trendy Hollywood cafe, Harold spots his favorite actress, Amanda Clark. She is with her agent Sidney Stone who is repeatedly getting up to make phone calls. When Harold sees Amanda sitting alone, he decides to introduce himself. Instructed not to mention his profession to her, Harold doesn't correct Amanda when she mistakingly assumes he is a writer. When she asks who his agent is, Harold innocently throws out the name of super-agent Arthur Blake. Amanda is impressed and charmed, and to Harold's amazement she proposes a date to discuss her next movie with him. As their relationship grows, so must Harold's charade to keep Amanda from discovering he is a Beverly Hills tour guide and not a hot-shot writer. He promises Amanda a script rewrite and convinces Arthur Blake to represent him. Harold's father is not so easily swayed, and tells Harold to snap out of it, "We show people movie star's homes, we do not date them!" With a rewrite deadline looming, an actress swooning, and his whole world rocking, Harold must choose what to write as well as do what is right.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Somewhat ridiculous yes, however those willing to suspend disbelief will be happy with Just Write. Jeremy Piven plays the lead role and makes this film, along with the gorgeous Ms Fenn. The combination of these two fine actors tips just Write into the 'good' category. Fans of the romantic-comedy genre will need little convincing and even those who aren't can take pleasure from the film. To summarise, Just Write is a good watch.</p>
