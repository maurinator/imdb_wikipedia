<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A devilish maniac is on the loose, kidnapping beautiful women left and right. Many of his unfortunate victims who do not comply to his sadistic demands end up being tortured...and killed.  Dr. Jack Cross (Morgan Freeman) is an insightful psychologist working for the police department. He has been hired to investigate a peculiar pattern of apparently random abductions of young, nubile women.  Cross fails to secure any leads until his battle with the infamous abductor turns personal.   The detective's niece has recently became the latest victim to this psychotic's premeditated schemes...Calling himself "Casanova," this misogynistic serial murderer is alluring, charming...and equally mentally destructive...Cross's only assistant is a beautiful and intelligent doctor (Ashley Judd). Another police detective (Cary Elwes) is also chasing after the kidnapper. With no clue or leads for unmasking this elusive stalker, the police with the help from the doctor must find a clever way to unlocking his secrets. As time becomes of the essence and the night takes over, Cross and the doctor rush desperately to seek out the lost souls who are under duress into becoming the fiend's prisoners...KISS THE GIRLS is a perversely provocative thriller with such stunning photography. The moody atmosphere truly enraptures the viewer into a dark nightmarish world. The lightning is sometimes incomprehensible for the picture, but this fault adds to the disturbing effect of the movie itself. KISS THE GIRLS is a great mystery, with the individual clues and seemingly isolated events carefully stitched together to create one whole puzzle that may just serve as the tip of the iceberg.Thanks to a seductively morbid tone,   the film keeps the viewer fascinated throughout the length of the flick.    KISS THE GIRLS is a sophisticated horror show since the audience never knows who the real killer may be. Even so, there is always more to the background scenery then what the eyes are allowed to see. The viewer must always eavesdrop when the leads interact with each other on screen...Deliciously diabolical! The performances from KISS THE GIRLS are first rate. Ashley Judd is riveting as a kick-boxing doctor whose strong willpower can make her an appropriate inspiration and role model for young females. Morgan Freeman establishes more integrity as a forensics psychologist, determined to track down his kidnapped niece. The main scoundrel, whoever his real name may be, is one of the most unique villains ever to embrace the screen.  His characteristics were wisely shot in a series of bleak, unrelenting shots so that the moviegoer may get a glimpse of his cryptic face, yet, they can not spill the beans as to find out who he really is.KISS THE GIRLS is a startling movie with an array of scares and plot twists to keep you interested plus a decent pace to keep the story-line moving.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.</p>
