<h1>The Chase (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Follows the plight of a young beauty as she flees from a mysterious pursuer through the halls of an abandoned building. As she is trapped at a dead end inside of a freight elevator, all hope seems lost until fate places two rescuers in the pursuer's path. A fight ensues, but who will win? And is our damsel in distress any safer if the other guys win? The Chase is the result of a self-imposed challenge by the filmmakers to produce a silent, yet compelling martial-arts driven story in an enclosed environment - a live-action Anime. Using the same location and scenario, a film version was shot by film purist Robert Banks for the purpose of comparison between style and medium.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short is filled with great fighting action. If you liked the Matrix battles, you'll dig these. Some creative and realistic stuff. A foot to the chest looks better then any of the fights scenes in the big budget Torque. I happen to have just seen that this evening and the producers of that movie could learn a thing or two from these filmmakers.The sound too was awesome. Sound plays a big part in any visual story, and so often I see shorts that lack any sound design. Thankfully this short has spent the time and money to get it right. Especially because it's so important to hear realistic hits to match the blows.The cinematography was just as good as the directing and both were great. I see that both and more are done by Johnny Wu. He wrote it too!I'd have given it a 10 if I understood the plot. Not the writers fault. I still don't understand the Matrix.Be sure to watch the credits to see behind the scenes of how they did some of the stunts.</p>
