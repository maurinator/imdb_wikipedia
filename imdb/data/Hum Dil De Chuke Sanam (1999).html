<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (English title "Straight from the Heart") is an epic story with gorgeous landscapes, singing, dancing, romance, danger, betrayal, humor, religion, family and cultural tradition all balanced and directed masterfully to produce the most beautiful film.I saw this movie at the Berlinale International Film Festival, and I knew from the start that it was a real gem. By the end I had decided that it was the best movie I had ever seen.Some of the backgrounds and special effects are not perfect, but I never would have paid any attention to that except that lots of people in the theater were laughing. Some people might grow tired of the singing and dancing, but they're really quite superb.This movie is worth watching every of its 187 minutes.</p>
