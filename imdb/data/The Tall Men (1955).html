<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To really enjoy 'The Tall Men', it has to be seen on a wide screen version. I saw it the first time in 1955 in cinemascope and can remember that the most enjoyable quality of this film is the cinematography and also the beautiful music. I bought a video converted for normal TV and it is sad to see that a good part of what goes on in the screen is just missing. The cattle drive, the scenery and the music makes 'The Tall Men' superior to 'Red River' whenever these scenes show up. Of course comparing them both as complete films 'Tall Men' does not come close to 'Red River' , which is much better. The titles that show up at the beginning are exactly like those of silent movies, perhaps Raoul Walsh was nostalgic of the old days. This was among the ten last films of of a great number that he directed in his career. It was also one of Gable's last. It is good to see those two old guys from the past meeting a new technology (cinemascope and stereo sound) and making the most of it. Jane Russel a bit too fat for modern day standards, gives one of her best performances. When 'The Tall Men' will come up on DVD on wide screen I will be among the first to buy it.</p>
