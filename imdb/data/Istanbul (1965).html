<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A handsome hero with a shady past and a knack for adventure (Horst Buchholz), a beautiful heroine assisting him (Sylva Koscina), evil masterminds and agents, kidnapped scientists, an exotic setting (Istanbul), fights & chases, etc: the stage is set for a 60's Bond-inspired spy adventure. This one begins pretty well, but loses its spark when Koscina (one of the most underrated spy girls of the decade see also "Deadlier Than The Male") disappears for long sections.Klaus Kinski also elevates the few scenes he is in (and has the best line in the film: "I am considered a good shot by those I have killed"!), but, like Koscina, he is underused. Buchholz is pretty good, both in the tongue-in-cheek and in the more violent moments, but the film is too long at 119 minutes, and about halfway through I began to lose the plot. At least it's better produced than many of these Bondian imitations, though the current VHS prints, fullscreen and worn-out, don't exactly do the production justice. (**)</p>
