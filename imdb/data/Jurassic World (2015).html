<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>22 years after the original Jurassic Park failed, the new park (also known as Jurassic World) is open for business. After years of studying genetics the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur. When everything goes horribly wrong, will our heroes make it off the island?</p>
<p>Jurassic World has been running with great success for more than a decade in the wake of the disaster that haunted the island 22 years ago. The park's geneticists have once again broken scientific and ethical boundaries in order to raise attendance for the park, now experiencing a decline in happy customers. Convinced that the new attraction will bring in many more people, but having crossed the line once again, the results may be devastating.</p>
<p>22 years after John Hammond envisioned a theme park full of dinosaurs, Jurassic World is a reality. Although it is everything he originally hoped it would be, attendance in the last decade has been lackluster. With the future of the park hanging in the balance, InGen scientists genetically engineer a new hybrid "attraction". When their new creation turns on them, will anyone get out alive?</p>
<p>Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfill a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitors' interest, which backfires horribly.</p>
<p>The new Jurassic World, owned by the corporation of Simon Masrani operates in Isla Nublar, Central America, with dinosaurs genetically created by the InGen Company. The workaholic and uptight manager Claire Dearing receives her nephews Gray and Zach in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the boys. Meanwhile the dedicated Owen Grady is training four velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins believes that the animal can be trained for military use. When Owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur Indominus Rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men and flees from the spot. Owen escapes and asks Masrani to kill the Indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. However the team is destroyed by the Indominus and Claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. But the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. Meanwhile Gray and Zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and Claire and Owen seek them out. With the chaos in the island, Vic assumes the command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the Indominus. Will his plan work?</p>
<p>A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction - a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine - escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of nextÂ… Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!</p>
