<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie. The directing, the photography, the acting, the story, the choice of the cast are wonderful. Kiefer is great, low key but cool. Melissa George does a great job. I like the acting of Bruno Angelico as the intriguing gangster, also the girl playing the drug addict these 2 intense roles are amazingly and unusually acted. This is film quality to TV. It is really too bad that FOX and then HBO didn't follow thru with it. It seems they had creative differences and the cost of a period piece scared them away. There is is not one TV show/series currently airing who is close to this. Csi, law and order etc.. seem repetitive and boring next to this. Kiefer would have done as well as 24 if not better.</p>
