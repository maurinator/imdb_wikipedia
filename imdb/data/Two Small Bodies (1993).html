<h1>Two Small Bodies (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eileen Maloney, a hostess at a strip joint, has woken up to find her two children are missing. Lieutenant Bramm suspects that she killed them herself. He questions her for days about her lifestyle, her children, her ex-husband, men and women, and life in general. He forces her to re-enact her last moments in the children's room hoping to shock her into giving more information. The lieutenant's infatuation is not merely professional, however, and soon they are reversing roles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know if the play was any better, but the dialogue in this small screen adaptation (made for German TV for some bizarre reason)is absolutely excruciating. Not to mention thoroughly unbelievable. The two characters, played by Fred Ward and Suzy Amis, are repulsive and whiny. Avoid at all costs.</p>
