<h1>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After an explosion on their moon, the Klingons have an estimated 50 years before their ozone layer is completely depleted, and they all die. They have only one choice - to make peace with the Federation, which will mean an end to 70 years of conflict. Captain James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their experience with the Klingons. Peace talks don't quite proceed, and Kirk and McCoy are convicted of assassinating the Klingon High Chancellor, and imprisoned on Rura Penthe, a snowy hard-labor prison camp. Will they manage to escape? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons?</p>
<p>After a lunar cataclysm brings the Klingons to their knees, the foreign concept of peace with the Federation may be finally within reach. After 70 years of hostility, the Federation and the Klingon Empire prepare for a peace summit. Ironically, Captain James T. Kirk has been assigned as the first emissary to broker that peace. However, the prospect of intergalactic glasnost with sworn enemies is an alarming one. When the Klingon flagship is attacked and the USS Enterprise is held accountable, the dogs are war are unleashed again, as both worlds brace for what may be their final, deadly encounter.</p>
<p>On the eve of retirement, Kirk and McCoy are charged with assassinating the Klingon High Chancellor and imprisoned. The Enterprise crew must help them escape to thwart a conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the last best hope for peace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now this was a movie. The best case scenario for the orginial crew to leave the movie scene, making peace with the Klingons and Sulu finally becoming a Captain. Everything was great in this movie. It had humor, adventure, mystery and just about anything else you could possibly want. The best behind #2.</p>
