The ensuing crackdown on student social activists is demonstrated when police break up a school dance wielding swords on horseback. Later, six students are kidnapped in the middle of the night, and the police deceitfully claim ignorance about their whereabouts.

He survives to tell their story, but the six are never found, numbering among the hundreds of students who were kidnapped and are still missing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"La noche de los lapices" is one of the best movies Argentina's made, not only because the story behind the movie was one of the worst part of our history, but also because it was for the director a heroic act to release a movie like this on those times.I strongly beg you to NOT believe marychase's comment about this movie. If you actually WATCH the movie you'll notice that you'll need no "extra" info about that times.</p>
