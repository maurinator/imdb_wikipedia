<h1>Making Mr. Right (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A reclusive scientist builds a robot that looks exactly like him to go on a long-term space mission. Since the scientist seems to lack all emotions, he is unable to program them into his automaton, and an eccentric woman is hired to "educate" the robot on human behavior. In the end, she falls in love... but is the robot or the Dr. Mr. Right?</p>
<p>After building a space-bound automaton in his image, a disturbed and emotionless young scientist hires a beautiful, perky P.R. woman named Frankie to teach his robot about human behavior. Then the unimaginable happens and the robot, Ulysses, falls in love with Frankie. She's confused about love herself and denies that Ulysses can have feelings for her.</p>
<p>Top P.R. consultant Frankie Stone is hired to promote Ulysses, the world's first automaton astronaut. As she spends more and more time with the creation, Frankie finds herself drawn towards Ulysses' sweet character and gentle temperament, and although she is permitted to teach Ulysses only what is vital to his approaching space mission, the robot quickly learns emotions, and it isn't long before he is madly in love with her. Much to the alarm of his identical creator, the dispassionate Dr. Jeff Peters. But where do Frankie's feelings truly lie?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If there were more genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this film, it could have achieved more commercial success. OR, if it hadn't been pitched to audiences as a straight comedy, it could have achieved later status over time as a cult film. This is the approach I think the producers should have taken. This would have made a great indie(rather than a mainstream release by the fledgling Orion Pictures) with Ann Magnuson still as the star. Have the actors play it straight as a character study and let the subtle natural comedy shine through. Laurie Metcalf's dingy character would have to be dismissed or toned down a bit, but otherwise this would work with the same quirky charm that made Mystic Pizza (released the following year) a success.As it is, the film is sweet more than it is funny. And it works thanks to John Malkovich's great dual performances and Magnuson's ability to carry a film (the only time she's been allowed to do so before or since--pity). Believe it or not, this was the film in which I discovered them both, and they should still be proud of having it on their resumes, even with all they went on to accomplish.I shouldn't be too hard on Orion, though. After all, they did put out "The Silence of the Lambs", but they also let "Blue Sky" sit on a shelf until they went belly-up and another studio had to release it four years after it was completed. The only flaw is not in this film itself, but in the way it was marketed and what I as an audience member expected going into it. This film deserves rediscovery--and if it gets it, there's the added bonus of '80s nostalgia in the fashions and some of the dialogue.</p>
