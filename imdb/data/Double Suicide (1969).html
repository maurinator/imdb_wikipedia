<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Double Suicide" is a bunraku puppet performance at its core, with perhaps the only difference being that actual humans play the roles of the puppets.The puppet masters, their faces covered with thin black silk masks, move around props, rapidly change the minimal sets, never interfering with the plot or the characters, yet moving them forward and cooperating with them in a way that is not at all distracting.The puppets themselves are finely crafted, and the characters that they play present a depth of humanity that is rare in all forms of staged entertainment (whether it be a movie, a play, or the like).  Being puppets, however, the viewer is left feeling detached from them, even if there is a sense of humanity present that one can grasp.  Oddly enough, that is a good thing in this case - it increases the sense of how the only thing that one could do when the tragic events unfold is to watch.This is not a film for all tastes, obviously.  But the same statement can apply to the bunraku puppet play that this movie is based on.  This performance is pulled off with perfection, and I highly recommend it.10 out of 10</p>
