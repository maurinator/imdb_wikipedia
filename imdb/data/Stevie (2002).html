<h1>Stevie (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>He began a film, a search, to discover not only what had happened to Stevie over the past ten years but to understand the forces that had shaped his entire life. Part way through the filming, Stevie is arrested and charged with a serious crime that tears his family apart. What was to be a modest profile turns into a intimate four and half year chronicle of Stevie, his broken family, the criminal justice system and the filmmaker himself, as they all struggle with what Stevie has done and who he has become.</p>
<p>In 1995 Director Steve James (Hoop Dreams) returned to rural Southern Illinois to reconnect with Stevie Fielding, a troubled young boy he had been an 'Advocate Big Brother' to ten years earlier.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The synopsis does sound terrible, however if you are willing to challenge your behalves and conceptions you'll get to see a film which is, with no better words to put it, simply unbelievable. And yes, it does require some open mind to really appreciate it, but hi, doesn't all great art does? This film will open your heart in a way you couldn't anticipate, regardless of how strongly you feel about child abuse. Stevie himself was abused and raped over and over again, from one abusing family to another. There's a commentator here that claims she knows lots of people who had it worse, well, I don't know where she's coming from but this is one horrible childhood. But like a genuine work of art this film doesn't come to advocate a man who did a terrible crime, he just trying to follow the road that was broken from the first brick. One of the greatest cinematic works of our time that has yet to receive its recognition.</p>
