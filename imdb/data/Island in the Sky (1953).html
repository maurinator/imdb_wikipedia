<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is based on a true story and I had the priviledge to fly with the co-pilot of that trip of Feb 3, 1943.  His comment was that he didn't like the movie because they showed the co-pilot dieing in the movie.  On Feb. 3, 1993,50th annaversary of the downing of the B-24 liberator/cargo version, I flew directly over Lac O'connor flying a trip from Frankfurt, Germany to Chicago, Ill.  The Lat. and Long. is roughly N54:20 and W74:30.  The movie didn't tell the whole story;although, very well done.  There was a Northeast Airlines DC-3 down also.  When they first found O'Connor and his crew, the NE Airline pilot thought he could just land and pick them up.  When he touched down, he was buried in snow.  They spent exactly 2 mos on the lake. They were flown out on April 3, 1943.  If you can find a book by James Mangan called westward....... something or other,  has a very factual run down.  Try the C.R. Smith museum in Ft. Worth, TX.</p>
