<h1>Codine (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An ex-convict struggles to survive by brute force alone in a turn-of-the-century slum in Braila. Codine (Alexandre Virgil Platon) is the thug who served 10 years for murdering a friend. He returns home to his miserly mother, whose penny-pinching ways infuriate her son. A young boy looks up to Codine, and through the man's eyes he sees the economic and social injustices from an adult perspective. When Codine kills another man who violated his trust, his mother becomes more unhinged and paranoid. Thinking her son will steal her hoarded money, she plots to kill her only son. The impressionable child watches in horror and amazement at the cruel machinations of the adult work that surrounds him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>for me, one of movies who has not definition. sure, the subject is not complicated. a dark hero of BrÄƒila. a local legend. killer, drunker, brutal man. a not very credible friendship. an ambitious project who has as axis only images from exotic slice of Balkans.good point - the revenge of mother . an adaptation, French-Romanian co -production. but that is all. Colpi gives a fake story and use the novel in a not inspired manner. the film is not saved by actors work but seems be decent for give the salt air of Danubian city. it is a nice trip. interesting not for for artistic virtues but for nostalgic crumbs and, maybe, for a form of humor. short - crumbs from Panait Istrati confession and the spiced dust of harbor. nothing else. only picture of a strange place.in not the inspired clothes.</p>
