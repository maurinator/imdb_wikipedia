<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rich socialite, Sandra Dee meets and marries photographer Bobby Darin and attempts to "train" him to be the perfect husband. Look for a very young Stephanie Powers as the devious friend .</p>
<p>Chantel worries about her new marriage to photographer Eugene failing so she decides to take her mother's advice and manipulate him. First, her mother gives her a book that will solve all her problems about how to treat a husband - namely a book on how to train dogs. Then, her mother gives her a second trick, an imaginary boyfriend who used to come in handy during her own marriage to Chantel's father. However, if Chantel's mother made this man up, what is she going to do when Eugene brings him home for dinner one night?</p>
<p>Rich socialite Chantal marries Eugene, a photographer, and everything seems blissful until her envious friend attempts to break them up. In desperation, she turns to her mother, but the advice she receives may do more harm than good.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And this comes from a lifelong feminist.I saw this film on TV back in 1973, along with "That Funny Feeling". I have just bought both movies on DVD.They're both cute movies made in the early 1960s. I take them for what they are. They're funny, sweet flicks that leave something to the imagination.I liked Chantal's mother....yes, an attractive woman over 40. How often do you see that today in youth-obsessed Hollywood? Everyone dressed age-appropriately and not a pair of fake breasts to be seen! Sandra looked lovely, as always.There are too many things in this world these days to get bent out of shape about - this movie is not one of them.</p>
