<h1>Splendor (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Splendor is the name of an old movie theater managed by Jordan (Mastroianni), who inherited it from his father. The theater is in decay and only generates debts and trouble, but Jordan gets aid in his almost quixotian quest from projectionist Luigi (Troisi) and ushurette Chantale (Vlady). However, Jordan is finally forced to sell the Splendor to businessman Lo Fazio (Piperno), which plans to transform it in some kind of furniture store. When Jordan leaves the theater for the last time (the very first scene), he recalls the glorious days of Splendor and movies in general.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this film at Cannes, which Festival I had regularly visited as the Director of a cultural cinema for several years. I saw it in the Grande Auditorium Lumiere, and, sitting next to me was my secretary. When the film ended, we just sat there and wept. If anyone wants to know what it is like to operate a cinema that seeks to present the cinema as an art, this is it - warts & all! Mastroiani is fabulous as the put upon owner of the cinema. Marina Vlady is enigmatic and voluptuous as his wife and cashier. Massimo Troisi is also superb as the obsessive projectionist.What this film is about is the glory of the cinema and the fickleness of the public. When I retired from my cinema, after 35 years, I showed this as my farewell film. We had almost a full house, and there was barely a dry eye in sight.</p>
