<h1>Gypsy (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>DANCE, THE GYPSY features ancient East Indian dance, as well as how and why this dance form also influences and is influenced by, other dance forms, specifically flamenco, Middle Eastern belly dance and ballet. The differences in the dance forms in terms of cultural significance, are addressed.</p>
<p>This is a film about the gypsy tribes who started the dance forms that developed into classical East Indian dance, Middle Eastern dance and further influenced both flamenco and ballet. Today the influences work in both directions. This is a new film based on my earlier 2011 film Dance, the Gypsy, with many changes in the sound design, subtleties in edits and some different footage.</p>
