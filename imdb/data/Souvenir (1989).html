<h1>Souvenir (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1944, a dashing German soldier and a beautiful French girl fell deeply in love while World War II raged on. More than forty years later, Ernest Kestner, retired and recently widowed, leaves his adopted home in New York and returns to France to visit his headstrong, estranged daughter, with the fleeting hope of finding the love he was forced to leave behind. But this is no ordinary vacation in the charming French countryside. The mood is strangely dark, and what Kestner and his daughter encounter is completely unexpected as the veteran soldier seeks the ultimate Souvenir - born from the ashes of a horrible, hidden secret. Based on the true story of Oradour-sur-Glane, a French town that was nearly wiped out near the end of WWII. Most every man, woman and child was gunned down or burned in retaliation for the French Resistance. The entire ruined town has been preserved as a national memorial.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you happen to be a military enthusiast, (and a sucker for a good romance) you'll love this movie. It takes place in 1944, in Nazi occupied France during WWII. Everything from the German uniforms & equipment to the vehicle markings are very authentic. Another great thing is that the French speak French & the Germans speak German. It really adds to the realism. I don't even consider the absence of subtitles during these sequences a problem. The acting is carried out in such a way that you don't even realize that you may not be comprehending the spoken dialog. Well done to those actors! Amelie Pick who portrays Janie I think steals the show. Of course Christopher Plummer is superb as always. Again, if you are into military authenticity and a sucker for a good romance (strange combination, I know), then you must see this movie!</p>
