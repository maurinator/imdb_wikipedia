<h1>The Outside Man (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jean-Louis Trintignant plays a French contract assassin hired by a Los Angeles crime family, ostensibly to perform a hit on some other mafia target. But simultaneously, as he arrives to do his job, a slaying occurs inside the household of the mob boss supposed to employ him. Suspicion is deliberately cast against Trintignant from within that very family. When he tries to flee the country, he discovers that his passport and luggage have been stolen. From that moment on, Trintignant is on the run from the police and the minions of two different mob families. What makes his escape hazardous is that the real murderer shares all the information known about him to aid in his capture and death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very low key actioner with sprinkles of offbeat humor.  French hit man does a job only to find the roles are reversed and he is now the target of another hit man.  Trintignant is well cast as a man not only confused with his unusual predicament, but also with southern California culture. There's been many, many films done in Los Angeles, but the excellent location shooting seems to show you a whole new city.  Although the film stays very true to it's unique form the downbeat ending could've and should've been avoided.  Georgia Engle is a delight as a dumb housewife.</p>
