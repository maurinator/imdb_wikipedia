<h1>Predator 2 (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A team of scientists have tampered in a realm of space that was to remain untouched. Guarded by a squadron of money-driven ex-Marine mercenaries called the Iron Bears (led by General Rykov), the scientists and mercenaries find themselves in the middle of a galactic war between a species of aliens and a species known as 'Predators.' The story is split into three campaigns, each depicting a different point of view from a different character: an expeditor U.S. Marine (not a member of the mercenary forces), an alien, and a predator.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You want a great AVP game? Here it is! Forget the games from 1993 and 1999. This one is the real deal! Forget the movies too. OK, the 2010 video game was OK, but this one... damn! OK, OK... now you get to play, again, with the marine, predator and alien. And each of them has a story-mission, that is connected to each other. That's the best thing about this video game, it has a perfect story that connects characters. Each and everyone of them is very playable, so you can chose and enjoy all of them, they are different of course, but I like how they did a perfect atmosphere and terrain for each of them. With alien, you got pretty rough terrain, with lot of jumping, climbing... but alien has next advantages: He is extremely fast, agile and powerful, he can tore apart a marine in just a second, for example. The predator's mission are pretty interesting, in my opinion most enjoyable of all three. You really feel like predator, it's so cool and sexy :). Predator is also strong, with advanced weaponry and hunting skills, but he is pretty slow. The marine has really cool, atmospheric missions, which are really scary, really, really creepy, and you got a bunch of big weapons that can save your butt if you are ready to use them in high voltage action. The marine's advantage is his weapons, use them wisely. I am not saying anything anymore, get this game and have fun!</p>
