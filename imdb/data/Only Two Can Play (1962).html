<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember seeing this on late night when I was about 10 and along with The Mouse that Roared turned me into a Peter Sellers fan for life!  I really prefer his early British films, although he was great in Strangelove and as Clouseau.  I'm Allright, Jack is a particular favorite, along with The Naked Truth, Heavens Above!, The Smallest Show on Earth, and Carleton Browne of the F.O.This is a sly, personal film about marriage and infidelity and it was nice to see director Mai Zetterling in a role that suited her.  With all the blockbuster junk-filled spectacles, there will always be a place for wonderful little films like this.</p>
