<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You're brain will surely melt away watching this movie. The weird mutant cyborg man shoots acid from his robotic appendage and he does melt at least one person in the movie.The main character is very typical of 80's science fiction being a pirate, thief or slave that finds out he is a prince. A great movie to watch if you are paralyzed and cant get away while being on heavy tranquilizers, or a great movie to make very young people watch and be so confused about what is going on. I suppose for its day back in the 80's it was amazing, but today the special effects are cheesy, look cheap and cant stand up next to the movies of today.</p>
