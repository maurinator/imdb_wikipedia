<h1>Maxie (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Nick and Jan move into their new apartment in San Francisco, the batty landlady upstairs tells them about a girl who used to live there in the 20's: a brash young party girl named Maxie, who died in a car crash the morning before her big audition for a Hollywood studio. The trouble is, Maxie, or rather her ghost, hasn't left the house. Worse, she can take over Jan's body. And the only way she's going to leave is if she gets that audition.</p>
<p>A 1920s flapper who haunts her old house possesses a dull housewife who just moved in. Hilarity ensues.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maxie is one of my favorites.  What is especially excellent is Glenn Close's ability to change between Jan and Maxie, by only a subtle change in expression.  She was remarkable.  Ruth Gordon too, made the movie memorable . As her last picture, it was a fitting tribute to a great actress.  The entire movie couldn't be better.  I am giving it a 10.</p>
