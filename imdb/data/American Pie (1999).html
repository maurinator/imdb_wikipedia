<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>American Pie starts right off with shock value, and while the film relies heavily on it, there's plenty of story and exceptional performances to hold your interest.  I attended a sneak preview of what I was told was a rough cut of the film, although there was only one scene that looked unfinished. The underlying story here is that of four high school senior buddies who have made a pact with each other to get laid before they graduate, specifically at the prom.  The problem is, only one of them has a serious girlfriend, and she can't decide if she's ready for sex.  But where the film really makes an impact is in it's numerous masturbation related scenes. There is one scene particularly early in the film that should test your stomach for the rest of the film's humor.  Now while the film may not sound like it has good morals, there is one repeated underlying message, and that is to do what you like and not what you feel pressured to do. Unfortunately, this is NOT the kind of film its target audience should be seeing.  At times it makes getting laid seem like the most important part of high school.  The strength of the film lies in the fact that everyone who went to a public high school can relate to some aspect portayed here, and in the strong and well-timed performances of the talented cast.  If you're mature enough to appreciate the film for its sheer comical performances, then you should really enjoy it.  But if you don't like "toilet humor", then you might not find anything appealing with this one.  Definitely not a date movie.</p>
