<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw this movie as a purchased VHS because in the cast was the late Heath Lamberts, a Canadian actor and comedian whose work I had admired for decades. But as the plot unfolded (see your other commentators) I saw that it was based on a legal maneuver that was to replicate itself in the US some 10 years later, namely the condemning of private property by the state in order to transfer it to a private real estate developer. In the novel/movie the plot was foiled but in the US the outrage generated by the Supreme Court's allowing this to take place (originally somewhere in New Hampshire I believe) inspired a slew of laws, both federal and state, being proposed to prevent it from happening again. In fact an internet plot was hatched to form a private development company and then go to the town council of the home of Justice Souter (I believe) whose swing vote in the 5-4 decision allowed it to pass, and propose a development which would have allowed that city to condemn Justice Souter's very own home for that purpose. I don't know how that all turned out. Bravo to Ryan Reynolds in a fine teenage career-starter. But wasn't Paul Anka's name left out of the list of credits? Did I miss it?</p>
