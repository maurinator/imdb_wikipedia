<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally looked up this movie on IMDB because something triggered my memory of this delightful movie. 25 now, I have not seen this movie in many years, so I was slightly surprised (Though I should not have been) when other viewers commented on the inhumane treatment of animals during the filming of this movie.As an initial note- STOP COMPARING THESE ANIMALS TO STUNTMEN! Stuntmen and women have the free will and prerogative to perform in movies or not. Animals do not have the same choice. By virtue of the fact that animals can't drive themselves to auditions or to the movie set, it should be clear that OWNERS, not ANIMALS made the decisions to be in this and other movies. The comparison is inane.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a young teen, but recognize now that the price undoubtedly paid by these animals was not worth 90 minutes of viewing enjoyment. If you choose to be entertained by a story of friendship between species, go to your local ASPCA and adopt a cat and a dog. The bond will be genuine, and the amusement value will last much longer than 90 minutes and you'll be promoting compassion to animals rather than abuse and mistreatment.</p>
