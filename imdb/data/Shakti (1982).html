<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two mega stars of Bollywood, Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan star in this action drama. The story is pretty familiar, with the father cast as a dedicated inspector and son a criminal. Instead of regular stunts and villains, the film focuses much on the psychological relationship between a father and the son, who both love each other immensely but fail to understand each other until it is too late. In their roles as a father and son, both mega stars have performed brilliantly and instead of their star power they have shown their pure acting skills. Smita Patil and Rakhee both have shared some of the most heart felt sequences. Music and songs are good enough. The flaws if you want to point out include certain sequences which are familiar from other Amitabh Bachchan movies like the regular cop and criminals chase, Amitabh's alcoholic scene, or the regular image of the police.Rating: 2 stars out of 4</p>
