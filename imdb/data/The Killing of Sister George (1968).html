As consolation for losing both her job and her lover, George is offered the voice part of a puppet cow in a new animated cartoon series.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a heck of a lot more relevant than more recent films dealing with lesbianism -- the shallow, lame DESERT HEARTS comes to mind.  Though over two hours long, TKOSG held me with little effort.  The action moved freely from the studio to the apartment to the pub.  And the seduction scene was totally erotic and ... well ... never mind.  Was this particular scene overly long? Only to a generation raised on sex scenes which rarely last as long as it takes to cook a three-minute egg.  Explicit?  Grow up!And the performances ... wow! I had no problem with the hold George had over Childie, with Beryl Reid's superior portrayal complemented perfectly by Susannah York's fragile and, at the same time, forceful Childie.  I must admit, York was a bit over the top in the beginning, but I wouldn't say that if I didn't count her as one of my all-time favorite actresses. And how about Coral Browne -- she was sensational!  Sublty menacing, eerily sensuous -- and when I realized this was the same woman from AUNTIE MAME and LYLA CLARE, well, I nearly fell off my chair.  I love this lady!</p>
