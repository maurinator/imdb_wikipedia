<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this film at an obscenely late hour the other night, and it was like a breath of fresh-air.  As soon as I saw Jason Priestly, I assumed it would be one of those terrible straight to TV movies that involved a cast of C-list celebrities wondering what on earth they were doing making such rubbish.Not so.  As the film progressed I realised, to my utter surprise, that I was actually really enjoying it.  The dialogue was funny, the characters interesting and the ending inspired.  Priestly was excellent, only ever achieveing such dizzy acting heights in another quirky classic, 'Love and Death on Long Island', and the supporting cast were genuinely talented.It wasn't perfect; it could have been longer, but it definietly had all the assets of a cult movie.</p>
