<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A black and white lowlife duo drives around Australia's Outback in a stolen vehicle and finds trouble after trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We stomached about 30 minutes of this silly film.I'm all for finding new, raw 'talent' and dealing with 'reality'. The two main characters are social bottom feeders and although they are poles apart presumably through their one-track dialogue about the plight of the aboriginal peoples they eventually find understanding... unfortunately we didn;t make it there with them! Their (constant) debates seem forced and completely unbelievable and clearly just there to provide a medium to push the left-wing agenda of the film maker. This grew tired VERY quickly.The film jumps haphazardly from scenes of rest or waiting to driving with little purpose or direction. Where are we going? Why did we do that!? These sorts of questions valid in any other film are best left at the door...I wanted to see this because I enjoy Australian films and especially like time capsules from the 60s and 70s. Avoid this agenda packed snore fest, see 'They're a Weird Mob' for queer vintage Aus instead...</p>
