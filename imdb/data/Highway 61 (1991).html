<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Surprisingly had only two written comments on this film, and then I can't help myself! This film has got some scenes which you'll never forget. A road movie with everything you want from one of it's kind. It all starts off when a local Canadian barber one morning is asked by a strange woman if he can drive her and her dead brother down into the U.S. - But is it her dead brother??? On the way they meet all kinds of strange people. This film contains so much - like the most fantastic bingo-scene in film ever, and what about indoor chicken hunt with guns, or the dream of having U2 to play in your wedding! I can't wait to see this movie again, and I understand it's now on DVD. So go buy it, never mind the price! This is hilarious fun with death on the back wheels! Don't miss it! The best Canadian film I ever saw!</p>
