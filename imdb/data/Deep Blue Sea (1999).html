<h1>Deep Blue Sea (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A businessman sinks $200 million into a special project to help fight Alzheimer's disease. As part of this project, medical biologist Susan McAlester rather naughtily figures out a way to genetically enlarge shark brains, so that disease-battling enzymes can be harvested. However, the shark subjects become super smart and decide they don't much like being cooped up in pens and being stabbed with hypodermics, so they figure a way to break out and make for the open sea...</p>
<p>Doctors in an underwater laboratory discover a chemical in the brains of sharks capable of reviving human brain cells. Using gene therapy the doctors create sharks with larger brain masses as a way to speed up the production of the life saving antidote. The result is a breed of Mako that is bigger, stronger, smarter, faster and more fierce then anything man has seen before. The sharks gain the ability to reason and turn on their masters resulting in an all or nothing fight to the finish between man and the ultimate predator.</p>
<p>Believing she almost has the cure for Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Susan McCallister invites Russell Franklin with the hope that he would invest in her and the research. The research is taking placed on an isolated facility in the middle of the ocean with the test subjects being Mako sharks. What was supposed to be a visit for Russell Franklin turns into something more, when the sharks flood the facility and hunt down the team, and thanks to the team, the sharks are now smarter than ever.</p>
<p>A group of research scientists, working in an abandoned off-shore submarine facility, appear to have discovered a neuro-stimulant, extracted from the brains of sharks, that cures Alzheimer's disease. However, unknown to the rest of the researchers the project leaders Dr. Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock have illegally used proscribed gene manipulation techniques to enhance the brain size of the sharks to attain their spectacular results. During a severe storm, whilst the researchers are celebrating their success, the newly intelligent sharks attack their captors in a bid to escape. As a result of the storm and the sharks attack strategy, the research facility suffers a catastrophic structural integrity failure and begins to submerge. The situation becomes a deadly race against time as the survivors, led by shark wrangler Carter Blake and Preacher, try to reach the surface and safety as the deadly intelligent killer-sharks continue to flood the facility and hunt their prey.</p>
<p>Aquatica is a research lab located in the ocean. Doctor Susan McAlester and Doctor Jim Whitlock are currently doing research to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer's Disease patients. It seems that sharks do not lose any brain activity as they age, leading Susan and Jim to think that the proteins found in the sharks' brains may lead to a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, which is what killed Susan's father. The research is being funded by a group of investors headed by Russell Franklin, and the investors are getting impatient with the pace of the research. It doesn't help that a shark got loose from Aquatica, and attacked a few teenagers who were on a pleasure romp. In an effort to save her project, Susan gets a forty-eight-hour reprieve from Russell, who goes to the Aquatica to see how his money is being spent. Susan skips a few steps in the research project and genetically re-engineers the DNA of three mako sharks in order to create larger makos so the makos will have larger brains. With only her weekend skeleton crew on board -- that is, marine biologist Janice Higgins, engineer Tom Scoggins, shark expert Carter Blake, meteorologist Brenda Kerns, and Aquatica chef Sherman "Preacher" Dudley -- Susan prepares for her experiment. The test is successful, but then they all see what Susan's genetic re-engineering on the sharks has done -- one of the sharks wakes up from an anesthetic and kills Jim. Susan and her crew radio for help, and a rescue helicopter crashes into the station during a tropical storm, and then another shark attack leaves Aquatica sinking into the water. The surviving crew members do whatever they can think of to escape from Aquatica while they're trying to fight off the three sharks.</p>
<p>Searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the bait as a trio of intelligent sharks fight back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is true but that doesn't mean it was a great movie. The effects were just simply great, especially for a shark movie. Definitely ahead of the Jaws series and almost everything else in terms of effects.The directing was not great but it was not bad. Harlin does enough to keep you entertained the whole movie but that is about it. Don't expect some Spielberg Jaws masterpiece. What pushed it to above average was the one kill scene that you will never see coming. His directing probably made it more funny than scary. That is not horrible though. I won't say who though. The acting was average. This is not a superb cast but that shouldn't be too shocking if you look at the storyline. Nothing else is really worth talking about in the technical aspects.Just watch it and you will see why it is just a CGI masterpiece.</p>
