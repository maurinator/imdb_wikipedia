<h1>Major Payne (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Major Benson Winifred Payne is being discharged from the Marines. Payne is a killin' machine, but the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield. A career Marine, he has no idea what to do as a civilian, so his commander finds him a job - commanding officer of a local school's JROTC program, a bunch or ragtag losers with no hope. Using such teaching tools as live grenades and real bullets, Payne starts to instill the corp with some hope. But when Payne is recalled to fight in Bosnia, will he leave the corp that has just started to believe in him, or will he find out that killin' ain't much of a livin'?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am a parent and very choosey about what content they view and I don't think children should see the movie BUT I would let them see this before I would Spiderman. Why? No sexual tone in this one, and no serious violence, just some sarcasm. I don't know what the kids may have gone through in the filming but I seriously doubt they experienced what the viewers did. I think the film is hilarious since the kids don't get hit by a car like in scary movie 3. Nowadays it seems you have to take what good is left in the big pile of shi@ and salavage what is still good to watch. I think it's never funny to laugh at child violence or the idea of a child being molested by a priest(scary movie3). I think it would be a bigger hit to bring out a Major Payne 2.</p>
