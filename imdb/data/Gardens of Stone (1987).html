<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent film.  The subject matter is not one that I thought would hold my attention....but I was wrong.  The characters in this movie will involve you in their lives, so be prepared to stay awhile.  The writing is first-rate.  But I was most impressed with the directorial abilities of Coppola....and here's the reason why:  he reined in the actors so that they gave marvelous, realistic performances (James Caan and Dean Stockwell are not always the most subtle of performers - but here, they are perfect).   There is one exception - Coppola allows Angelica Huston to shine, and brings her out to full advantage (what is the opposite of 'reining in?').   For all the actors to turn in such great portrayals says something about the director, I think.</p>
