<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The wildlife of the arctic is explored in this true-life adventure.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This documentary is one of the best ever produced by Disney and has both the strengths and weaknesses of most Disney documentaries-excellent visually and technically but with narration that is all too frequently vapid, silly and boring, with the added difficulty that the narrator's droning monotone almost puts me to sleep.  The visuals more than make up for any shortcomings.  Recommended.</p>
