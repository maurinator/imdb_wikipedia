<h2> Summaries </h2>

Soon, though, the tenderfoot finds out life on the range is neither what he expected nor what he's been looking for...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The attitudes and comments of the actors playing drovers of cattle from Texas to Kansas were the closest to those of real cowboys ever put on the screen.I worked as a rider for the cattle association for a while and the personalities were the same.The joke that Jack Limon had never rode a horse so he should get a horse that had never been ridden was real cowhand humor.The cowboys finding that city living was too rough for them after partying in Chicago for a few days, and they best get back out on the trail where it was safe, was real cowhand humor.The change in Jack as he became more interested in the profit and less being the dude was realistic.This was a movie showing real history of a tough business that would soon fade into romantic lore.</p>
