<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cheech and Chong run an ice cream business called Nice Dreams, which actually is a cover for them to sell their special blend of dope. Soon after reaching a considerable amount of cash they decide to retire for a relaxing life on their own island with all the girls they want. But before this dream can become reality, they have to elude the cops led by the Sarge Stedanko who will stop at nothing to get their hands on them. All of this leads to many unplanned confrontations and actions that don't always workout for the best.The third film of the series is a really spaced-out stoner comedy (even more so then the first two flicks) from the comical duo Cheech and Chong. This one is more spaced-out because it throws in some surreal moments into fodder. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two outings, sure nothing will beat the memorable "Up In Smoke", but I thought they slightly out did themselves here compared to their previous outing "Next Movie" and that could be attributed to Stacy Keach returning as Sarge Stedanko too. It was great to see that Sarge and his man are on the trail again. Though, I wish there was a bit more screen time for Keach.Everything about this one seems more silly and absurd, especially the scenes involving how anyone, or anything that smokes their strong weed will turn into a lizard. The whole concept is purely stoner humour! The film doesn't have much in a way of narrative, but more so comical episodes. But that's what you expect anyway. Something is always happening with Cheech and Chong getting in all sorts of mayhem and also meeting buoyant and irregular characters along the way. One of those characters involves a whacked out doctor and Paul Ruben's performance as Howie Hamburger Dude adds to the laughs too. The humour is required taste, definitely. It throws in many sexual and drug related gags. Sure, some of the jokes and gimmicks are crude, messy, coarse and fall flat, but the pair works off each other perfectly well with their fluid timing that you seem to let it all go. They alone can carry a film. It moves along rather quickly, which helps considerably too and there's a well-booted and spicy soundtrack to keep the energy levels high. Also I loved the ironic ending to their dream life. The script might be filled with low-brow lines, but still you got some clever wit and pointless rambles that are engaging enough, if moronic in vibe. It's not terribly perfect as a whole, but there are enough spirited and unpredictable sketches (like the nut-house and acid trip scene and those ones involving the incompetent police) and performances to overlook these failures. From what I hear and read, people usually rate this one as their second best feature and I tend to agree.Incredibly stupid, but I got a kick out of it nonetheless. It's an enjoyably crazy romp from the beginning to the end. A definite must for the fans.</p>
