<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film opens with British copper Pete Strange (Michael York ) being sent off to prison in disgrace.  We then flash back to his first day on the job and find out why he ended up such a loser.  Detective Pierce (Jeremy Kemp ) is tipped off to a drug shipment being delivered to Quince ( Jack Watson ) , head of a London crime family.  The criminals are in turn tipped off by the corrupt Inspector Evans ( Arto Morris ) and they are not caught.  Pierce knows Evans blew his case and is determined to get Quince.  Meanwhile, Strange meets Fred March (Susan George ) on the job and while  attracted to her, he won't date her as she is weeks away from legal age ( 16 ).  Fred persists and Strange agrees to a date and meets her at her aunt and uncle's house where she is staying.  Unknown to Strange and Fred is the fact that auntie and uncle are pornographers who aren't against using their under aged niece in their underground business.  Strange is seduced by Fred and their tryst is secretly caught on film.  Later, Strange is viciously assaulted by the  Quince family, but can't ID them as they wore masks.  Pierce attempts a second drug bust but is outwitted by Quince and is subsequently demoted. Frustrated beyond reason, Pierce coerces Strange to help him plant evidence that will convict Quince by threatening to expose his affair with a minor. Strange reluctantly agrees, leading to the downbeat finale. Directed by David Greene, THE STRANGE AFFAIR mixes several differing elements with ease.  Corrupt police, brutal British gangsters and the youth movement  all figure prominently  and Greene blends them deftly.  Greene ( THE SHUTTERED ROOM, GODSPELL ) worked mainly in television, working  on the Twilight Zone  and other programs before graduating to features in the mid 60's.  He went back to TV in the 70's and directed 2 of the most popular mini series ever, ROOTS and RICH MAN POOR MAN, and remained in television for the rest of his career.  Michael York was fresh off of ROMEO AND JULIET and is well cast as the young idealist who joined the force to help his fellow man.  Jeremy Kemp is very effective as the angry and humiliated Detective Pierce.  He would appear with Ms. George in SUDDEN TERROR a few years later.  Jack Watson's Quince is a fine study in evil who delights in thwarting Pierce at every opportunity.   A great British character actor, Watson appeared in PEEPING TOM, KONGA and TOWER OF EVIL among many others. Susan George is the real surprise here.  Her presence brings the film to life and it is a treat to see this early unaffected performance which no doubt led to her first starring role in the Charles Bronson drama TWINKY ( 1969 ) / LOLA ( 1973, US ), ironically also detailing  an under aged affair. Released by Paramount, THE STRANGE AFFAIR has never had a US home video release and remains hard to find. Only cut pan and scanned prints have played on cable, making this a fine candidate for dvd release and subsequent rediscovery.  The cast here is quite strong and George and York still have an active fan base.  Seeing as this is held by Paramount, this may take a while to surface...but there is always hope.</p>
