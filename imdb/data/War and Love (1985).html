<h1>War and Love (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jacek, who is Jewish, miraculously manages to survive World War II in Nazi-occupied Poland. As a subplot to Jacek's story, which also involves a love affair with Haling ( Kyra Sedgwick ) and German soldiers' repeated attempts to kill him, is a tale of how young kids in the Warsaw ghetto devise their own method of fighting oppression.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this one when i was young and right about the time i was beginning to have some of my teenage crushes. It taught me about how it felt when you lose something you cherish-your loved ones.I saw it again recently and i felt the pain of the characters in this movie again(proving that i wasn't a mushy teenager).This may not be a very famous movie but i feel its like 'Titanic',both movies being love stories set amidst a backdrop of disaster.Here the backdrop being the second world war.It tells us the story of a youthful romance much like that of Jack and Rose in the Titanic.Here Jacek and Halina's love story is rudely interrupted by the German invasion of Poland(the story is set in Poland). Most of the incidents in this movie are true like the main characters joining a band of fighters fighting 2 whole German divisions in Warsaw and would have defeated them had their numbers were more. Then comes the inevitable concentration camp for our heroes. (I was not that aware of the horrors that the Nazis unleashed until i saw this movie and Schindler's List later that year)They really do go through hell after that and finds(i feel) shadows of each other.The war and the devilish concentration camps take their toll on them.I don't want to give away the story but this movie really captivates us from start till end. The fresh faced Kyra Sedgwick made me fall in love with Halina(who sadly suffers a lot because she is a Jew). This is a movie for romantics(i'm one) and is a thorough tear jerker.Watch the movie to find what happens to them.I am sure you will be haunted for a long time after this experience and you will and should stop taking your loved ones for granted.Love them cus they are here now and maybe gone tomorrow because of unexpected and uncontrollable events like what happened to Jacek & Halina.</p>
