<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jandhyala is a master film maker, especially in the genre of comedy. This film depicts his sense of control over comedy genre. The film is about a man trying to convince the girl's father to marry his daughter to him. Its also about a bet between the man and his father.How does he do it? Well it is best seen than explained. Sure that this one makes you roll with laughter, quite literally. The characters are so rich and deep that laughter is produced naturally. There are no efforts to create jokes, nor are there any useless jokes. Everything blends just so perfectly that you transport to a new world where everything is fun.The Classic Comedy of Telugu Cinema.</p>
