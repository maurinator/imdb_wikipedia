<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ida Lupino was a genius and way before her time!  All of the films that she has directed including "The Bigamist", to me, have something in them that I'm always surprised that the censors didn't take out!  Excellent story, good cast that work together wonderfully, great cinematography, good script! This film is almost a film-noir as there is an air of mystery about it! Enjoy!</p>
