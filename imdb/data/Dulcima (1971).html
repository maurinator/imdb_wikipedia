<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was shown on T.v. when I was a young girl early 70's I think.Although i was young I could tell this film was a real classic. I raved about it to my friends none of whom had seen it on T.V.I think they thought I was obsessed, I was.At the time I lived in the country in a beautiful village, Hartington in Derbyshire. I think the film had such a profound effect on me because I could imagine the film's story really happening.This film has always been my favourite, when discussing movies I have said how wonderful I think it is and have been amazed that no one had heard of it. John Mills is one of my favourite actors and it was probably this film that drew my attention to any film he was in. I have recently acquired a lap top so the first thing I did was to search for Dulcima. How pleased I was to find it through Google and will be purchasing a DVD as soon as possible, like now. Its been a long time coming, but as they say things come to those who wait, so looking forward to putting it in the DVD to watch a truly amazing film and to being transformed back in time to those wonderful days of my youth. Thankyou so much to all involved.</p>
