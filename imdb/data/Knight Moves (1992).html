<h1>Knight Moves (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A chess grandmaster is in a big tournament, and when his lover is found painted up and the blood drained out of her body he becomes a chief suspect.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Knight Moves is one of the finest suspense movies I have ever viewed. The only thing you know for certain in this film is that one of the characters on screen is the killer. The interplay between Peter( Christopher Lambert) and Andy ( Daniel Baldwin) is perfection.  Even using The Empress Hotel in Victoria BC  for location gave this movie the right feel as a thriller.</p>
