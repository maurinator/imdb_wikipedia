<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For some reason whenever I hear the word 'Spring' I inevitably think of the movie 'Come Next Spring' which I remember seeing as a teenager. I thought Ann Sheridan & Steve Cochran were near the end of their careers and this was their swansong and did they know how to capture the whole essence of a small town community going through a crisis.  It is  warm, gentle and has a loving nature running all through it as though they all knew that the studio was near the end like a lot of the cast in their careers.  Even the song I can still remember.  Worth a remake?  No impossible.  It was the film that got away but luckily I have a good memory!</p>
