<h1>Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sub-titled "The Birth of Extreme", this documetary takes a look at the transformation of skateboarding from its former image as a land-bound pastime for surfers to its status today as an extreme and acrobatic sport in its own right. Starting from the California surf community of Dogtown, the film follows the evolution of modern skateboarding through it's 70's heyday, its decline during the 80's, and its eventual (and highly lucrative) return in the 90's.</p>
<p>In the mid-70s, surfers from Venice-Santa Monica who hung out at the Zephyr Surf Shop would skateboard when the surf was quiet. Over the course of a few heady years, riding on polyurethane wheels and copying the surfing moves of Larry Bertleman, the Z-Boys invent and polish their style on a hilly street near the shop, on the asphalt slopes ringing school playgrounds, and then in swimming pools empty during California's drought. The Z-Boys astound upright skateboarders at the 1975 championship in Del Mar. Within a year, the team splinters as some players join better financed pro teams. The film ends with profiles of the stars, Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva.</p>
<p>Documentary about the pioneering 1970s Zephyr skating team.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I never surfed or skateboarded but I still found this documentary fascinating.  I accidentally stumbled on it while channel surfing (not sidewalk surfing) and watched it a second time later in the day.  The Z-Boys made me think of the early days of rock and roll when young kids with no formal musical training basically "invented" rock and roll as they went along..  It seems the Z-Boys did the same with skateboarding.</p>
