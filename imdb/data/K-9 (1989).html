<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Narcotics Cop Thomas Dooley(James Belushi) is an unusual off-beat person... who loves to work alone. One day, his boss (Cotther Smith) wants Dooley find an new partner. He decides to use an K-9 named Jerry Lee (Koton), who has the best nose for the drug-busting business. At first, Dooley and Jerry Lee don't get along until they share a few things in common. At the same time, Dooley does his best with his love life (Mel Harris) and trying to bust a prominent socialite (Kevin Tighe). Thomas and his new partner are in for a wild ride.Directed by Rod Daniel (Beethoven's 2nd, Like Father Like Son, Teen Wolf) made an enjoyable if silly cop between an relationship with a man and a dog. Belushi and especially Koton are good in the film. There's some hilarious moments, which this movie is aimed at kids but there's some violent scenes as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. DVD features are basically like the original theatrical trailer and cast & filmmakers' bios. "K-9" was an surprise box office hit. But the relationship between a man and a dog came out months earlier in 1989, which it has some of the same premise titled "Turner & Hooch". But i feel that "K-9" is the better film than the other one. But that's up to the viewer to decide. There's some familiar faces in "K-9" in bit parts like Ed O'Neill, Alan Blumenfeld, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Dan Castellaneta (Best Known as the voice of Homer Simpson on "The Simpsons") and William Salder. "K-9" was so popular on video, there was two Direct to Video movies produced... starring James Belushi. "K-9" is a good cop comedy with some genuine laughs. Worth seeing. (****/*****).</p>
