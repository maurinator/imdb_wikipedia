<h1>Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A shipping disaster in the 19th Century has stranded a man and woman in the wilds of Africa. The lady is pregnant, and gives birth to a son in their tree house. The mother dies soon after. An ape enters the house and kills the father, and a female ape takes the tiny boy as a replacement for her own dead infant, and raises him as her son. Twenty years later, Captaine Phillippe D'Arnot discovers the man who thinks he is an ape. Evidence in the tree house leads him to believe that he is the direct descendant of the Earl of Greystoke, and thus takes it upon himself to return the man to civilization.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having  seen numerous Tarzan movies over the years, I consider Greystoke, one of the best, if not the best.  It played with all emotions.  Christopher Lambert's portrayal of Tarzan was excellent. I have never read Borough's book, but this adaptation must, in the least, put any  Tarzan movie that Johnny Weismueller or Lex Barker played in to shame.  I have seen this movie at least 5  times and would watch it again and again.</p>
