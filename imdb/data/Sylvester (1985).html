<h1>Sylvester (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Working in a Texas stockyard, breaking horses, Charlie's doing the best she can to support herself and her two brothers. But when she loses her job, she gets the idea to take her best bronco, Sylvester, and turn him into a lucrative profit by training him for three-day eventing. But since she knows little of dressage and show-jumping, it's going to take the help of her old boss, an ex-cavalryman, to get ready for competition.</p>
<p>Charlie is a 16-year-old orphan struggling to raise her two younger brothers when she endeavors to train a rogue horse she names Sylvester and turn him into an eventing champion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Parents, this movie is not for kids. I got this movie because my girls like horses and I wanted to see Melissa Gilbert in a different role. However, Melissa is no longer the innocent young girl from Little House on the Prairie; gratuitous profanity, sexual references, and frontal nudity during an attempted rape scene disqualify this as a family movie. It's unfortunate because the story line is actually good. Her hard work and dedication bring her to a decision point that will impact the rest of her life. As another review elsewhere wrote: while entirely predictable, and the story of a come-from-nowhere horse and rider may be clich√©, the acting is believable and the riding shots are well-done.</p>
