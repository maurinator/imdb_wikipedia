<h1>Ginger and Cinnamon (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Stefania breaks up with her boyfriend Andrea, little does she realize what the summer has in store for her. She winds up on vacation at a Greek resort 'isle of love' with her 14 year old niece. Unfortunately, her teenage niece has something more than sun and surf on her mind; she decides that this Mediterannean paradise is where she will finally lose her virginity. However, in an ironic twist, the cute guy she has her eye out on turns out to be none other than Andrea, her aunt's ex-boyfriend. This light-hearted "comedy-of-errors" is a valuable lesson in what being a woman means at any age.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this almost-consistently funny Italian comedy, a 14-going-on25 teen (think a more naive 1st season Meadow Soprano without the smirk and an additional 20 lbs.) ditches her Girl Scout troop to bond with her 30 yr "old" aunt, who is still obsessing full-time about the breakup of her 8yr romance. Teen cons aunt into going to Cycladies, Greece (the party capital of the Mediterranean, from the looks of things). Identity mix-ups, almost-sexual escapades abound, but will true love work out in the end? And would a bollywood dance number be appropriate?We get a little too much of the sex-obsessed teen, and a little too little of the gorgeous "old maid", but the movie pulls you along in its quest. The world needs to see more of Stefania Montorsi, a delightful screen presence.</p>
