<h1>Convoy (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While driving through the Arizona desert, Albuquerque based independent trucker Martin Penwald - who goes by the handle "Rubber Duck" - along with his fellow truckers "Pig Pen" and "Spider Mike", are entrapped by unscrupulous Sheriff Lyle "Cottonmouth" Wallace using a key tool of the trucker's trade, the citizens' band (CB) radio. Rubber Duck and Cottonmouth have a long, antagonistic history. When this encounter later escalates into a more physical one as Cottonmouth threatens Spider Mike, a man who just wants to get home to his pregnant wife, Rubber Duck and other the truckers involved, including Spider Mike, Pig Pen and "Widow Woman", go on the run, figuring the best thing to do being to head to New Mexico to avoid prosecution. Along for the ride is Melissa, a beautiful photographer who just wanted a ride to the airport. As news of what happened spreads over the CB airwaves, other truckers join their convoy as a show of support. Cottonmouth rallies other law enforcement officers throughout the southwest, they who soon learn that stopping Rubber Duck, the face of the now highly public standoff, is not as easy as shooting him and the truck due to his highly explosive cargo. As the standoff escalates, New Mexico Governor Jerry Haskins joins the fray, he who sees the strong public support for the truckers being something on which he can capitalize politically.</p>
<p>The truck drivers Martin "Rubber Duck" Penwald, Bobby "Love Machine" "Pig Pen" and Spider Mike are crossing the Arizona desert and they are lured by the corrupt Sheriff Lyle "Cottonmouth" Wallace that takes money from them.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>CONVOY, even after almost 30 years since it was released, remains was  it was, an iconic American film by an iconic American director. This movie,which is not short on American archetypes, from Ernest  Bornine's vile redneck sheriff "Dirty Lyle," to Kris Kristofferson's  independence-loving "Rubber Duck," to Ali MacGraw's free-spirited  "Melissa," is really an old-fashioned Western, but with trucks. LOTS of  trucks.Like Clint Eastwood's "man with no name" gunslinger, Kristofferson (who  steals every scene with his smile and blue eyes) is a man whose sense  of honour and justice compels him to act on behalf of the down-trodden;  symbolized in this case by a black truck driver named "Spider Mike"  (played by actor Franklyn Ajaye). But instead of guns and "pistols at  dawn" Kristofferson uses a semi. But it's not "justice" he's after, for in the world of CONVOY "justice"  (per se) doesn't really exist. That's what makes this film so iconic.  If it was about "justice" this movie would have been a court drama,  with the Rubber Duck hiring a lawyer, going to court, and getting Dirty  Lyle tossed in jail for his arrogance and abuse of power.Nor is it about mere revenge, for throughout the movie Kristofferson's  character never truly reaches the point where he simply wants to hurt  and destroy his nemesis. It's rather about personal honour and how we,  as individuals, define it. Spider Mike, therefore, becomes not so much the victim of racism (which  is repeatedly emphasized by the other characters calling him "boy") but  of a system that has allowed dishonourable people (in positions of  power) to abuse that power at will. Into this world comes the  "legendary" Rubber Duck, the "last of the independents," who alone is  willing to strike a blow for the diminished honour of another man,  while seeking no reward for himself.This is the essence of the American Western and why it works so well in  CONVOY. Take away the trucks, put on some cowboy boots and a  six-shooter, and you have before you any number of Westerns whose sole  premise is that one man with personal integrity and honour can make a  real difference in the corrupt world in which he lives. The difference in this case is that Kristofferson doesn't just "clean  up this one horse town" he, with the aid of his "posse" of like-minded  truckers (Burt Young does a terrific job as his side-kick "Pig Pen"),  totally demolishes it. And like those great Westerns, only then can  Rubber Duck find solace for his spirit; which he does without  compromising either his own values or his personal integrityThis is the essence of honour itself and what really makes this movie  work. Even, now, after almost 30 years, one cannot help but stand and  cheer as Rubber Duck and company take on the forces arrayed against  them as the movie reaches its climax. And then stand up cheer again  during the closing d√©nouement.CONVOY, therefore, isn't about "America," or even about being an  American, it IS America; the America of myth and folklore that people,  even now, still believe in and which the great Westerns of old have  done so much to popularize. Because of that and because director Sam  Peckinpah does it with such style and grace, this iconic movie, by an  iconic director, deserves a place on the shelf of every lover of good  solid entertainment</p>
