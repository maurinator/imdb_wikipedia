<h1>Salt of the Earth (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on an actual strike against the Empire Zinc Mine in New Mexico, the film deals with the prejudice against the Mexican-American workers, who struck to attain wage parity with Anglo workers in other mines and to be treated with dignity by the bosses. In the end, the greatest victory for the workers and their families is the realization that prejudice and poor treatment are conditions that are not always imposed by outside forces.</p>
<p>This film - blacklisted in the USA for 11 years and not shown there until 1965 - looks at a group of HIspanic miners who are long-time residents of New Mexico. Esperanza Quintero, her husband Ramon and their three children line in company provided housing with poor sanitation facilities. They make ends meet - just - but Ramon's job in the zinc mine is dangerous and the company seems to care little about the men's safety. After a mining accident, the men decide to go on strike. Their picketing prevents scabs from replacing them but after 6 long months of picketing, the company obtains a court order to remove the picketing miners. At this point the women step in and replace them, though it leads many to jail before leading them to victory.</p>
<p>Mexican workers at a Zinc mine call a general strike. It is only through the solidarity of the workers, and importantly the indomitable resolve of their wives, mothers and daughters, that they eventually triumph.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film has a rare and beautiful honest quality seldom seen to this magnitude in pictures.  Made during the height of McCarthyism in the 1950s it was produced completely by a blacklisted crew and professional cast.  The film itself was banned in the U.S.A. by congress until the late 1960s.  The picture is based on a true story of Mexican-American mine workers on strike in New Mexico.  It deals with the wives of the miners having to to step up and work the picket lines in place of their husbands who were legally banned from picketing.  Many of the cast members were actual participants in the original strike and the leading lady was deported before the film was even finished.  The story of the struggle to make this film would actually make a good film.  Ironically the film is very patriotic and shows what truly makes America great; it's people.   A strong man and woman's picture with a genuinely beautiful fighting human spirit.  It's one of a kind.</p>
