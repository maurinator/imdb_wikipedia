<h1>The Train (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As the Allied forces approach Paris in August 1944, German Colonel Von Waldheim is desperate to take all of France's greatest paintings to Germany. He manages to secure a train to transport the valuable art works even as the chaos of retreat descends upon them. The French resistance however wants to stop them from stealing their national treasures but have received orders from London that they are not to be destroyed. The station master, Labiche, is tasked with scheduling the train and making it all happen smoothly but he is also part of a dwindling group of resistance fighters tasked with preventing the theft. He and others stage an elaborate ruse to keep the train from ever leaving French territory.</p>
<p>During WWII, the Nazis have stolen many priceless works of art, planning to destroy those they deem against their sensibilities. German Colonel Franz von Waldheim, however, is an art aficionado and as such, against the wants of the Germans in general, decides in August 1944, days before it looks like France will be liberated, to bring back to Germany many of those priceless works of art from the Jeu de Paume in Paris. von Waldheim will go to any length to achieve this largely personal mission, which he plans to accomplish by transporting the art packed in crates via rail. Mlle. Villard, the curator of the gallery, asks the Resistance to stop von Waldheim. Paul Labiche, a railway inspector and one of the leaders of the Resistance, initially does not want to assist Mlle. Villard, seeing the lives of the Resistance members and the larger goals of French freedom as more important. But based on incidents, Labiche changes his mind and assists in the mission, he who ends up having an up close and personal vantage point. Labiche's elaborate plan has many obstacles to overcome to achieve success, including von Waldheim's own success at any cost mentality.</p>
<p>Oberst von Waldheim wants to bring modern paintings, the ones the Nazis called "degenerate", out of Paris before the Allied Forces liberate Paris. He is able to persuade his bosses to give him the train. Labiche, a French railway official is asked by the management of the museum to stop this train, but he is not willing to risk the life of his people for art. But when his old friend Boule is shot by the Germans accusing him for sabotage on the engine he starts to work against the Germans, and tries to delay the departure of the train until the Allies are arriving.</p>
<p>In 1944, a German colonel loads a train with French art treasures to send to Germany. The Resistance must stop it without damaging the cargo.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my all-time favorite war movies, always rated in the top three since I first saw it years ago. I rate it so high because of four main things:1 - Wonderful black-and-white photography; 2 - an interesting cast led by two great actors, Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield; 3 - An intelligent, different kind of war story revolving around stolen works of great art; 4 - Just the right amount of action.Not only the blacks-and-whites look good but the grays, too. The nighttime train shots with the white steam coming out is just spectacular. You can feel the grease and grime on these railroad men as the work on the train. The person best exemplifying that is the Frenchman Michel Simon who plays "Papa Boule," the engineer who begins the train trip and then is shot after being discovered sabotaging it. What a great face this man had! He, Lancaster and other grimy railroad men with soot all over their faces give this a real authentic feel. Most of the cast is either French or German but if you have a hard time understanding a few lines, you can put on the English subtitles if you are playing the DVD.This is a pretty long film but it doesn't have many lulls, especially the train starts to roll. I have viewed this a number of times and have never been disappointed with it. Director John Frankenheimer gives some interesting commentary on this, too, so you might to check that out on the disc.</p>
