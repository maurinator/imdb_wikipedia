<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Oh my gosh this movie tops sad of all sad! All I remember of this movie was how traumatized I was as a child by it. Every time it was going to be on my family tried to keep me from seeing it but every once in a while I would catch a glimpse and make them let me watch it and then I would go into hysterics at the end. It would normally take about an hour and a half to settle me down, so I'm told, I would cry so hard that I would end up throwing up. I asked my friends, now in their mid twenties if they remembered this movie from childhood and they all said they did and they all remembered crying and such when they watched it as well. I can still remember poor dot screaming and crying for her kangaroo to come back to her after leaving her at her home and he never comes back! It was just horrible! Why would anyone make a movie so sad? geez!</p>
