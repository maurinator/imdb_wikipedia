<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a sportsmovie. It's got every sports cliche in the book: "I look at you and see two men. The man you are and the man you ought to be." But, hell, who cares? It's the Major League of football movies. Sure, it's not gonna win an Oscar, but it's entertaining. A good movie to kill 2 hours. You want drama in a football movie, check out Any Given Sunday. You want fun, mindless entertainment, check this out. Props to Keanu Reeves for learning to throw like a genuine quarterback.</p>
