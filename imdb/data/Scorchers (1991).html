<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For those that really know great film this is one that you might appreciate. Scorchers is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The beginning of the film just drew me in and had me captured with the haunting air of the ambient sound in the back ground. Actually the whole movie had a glow that reminded me of when I spent a summer in Georgia. Next the beautiful Emily Lloyd played her part well as the bride that is nervous about her wedding night and has to overcome her problem. There are also many wonderful character in this film that one has to watch it in order to fully understand it's beauty. I have to say this is a must see for it's humor, it's love and it's originality. I wish that more films could capture me in it,s web as this one has. I have been waiting forever for this fantastic film to go to DVD, unfortunately it seems that this will never be. All that I can hope for is for the director to one day become famous enough that the world might know of this wonderful film that will stay with me always.</p>
