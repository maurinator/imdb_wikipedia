<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Food of the Gods II tells the legacy of a group of giant, man-eating rats who infest a college campus.  Only a determined scientist (Paul Coufos) and his girlfriend (Lisa Schrage) can stop the monstrosity of a menace.  This Canadian production features poor special effects, some of the worst matte effects seen in years.  The acting is below average, and production values only qualify this as a mediocre cable movie.  Lots of gore galore in this flick, but the film moves in a dreadfully excruciating pace...</p>
