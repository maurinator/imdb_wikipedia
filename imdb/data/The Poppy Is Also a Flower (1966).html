Along the way, they encounter a mysterious woman doing her own investigating of the smuggling operation. Together, they follow the trail as it leads them through the back alleys and luxury resorts of Europe.</p>
<p>United Nations narcotics agents attempt to trace heroin shipments from the Afghanistan-Iran border to the main European distributor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hilariously awful star-studded turkey, an apparent do-gooder drama concocted by Ian Fleming, sponsored by Xerox and directed by Bond-filmmaker Terence Young, details the United Nations' efforts to stop the trafficking of opium out of the Middle East. Bungled ingredients include star-cameos, an introduction by Grace Kelly (!), and Yul Brynner (misspelled in the credits) as a fez-topped Colonel who rides out to meet his enemies on horseback as if this were a Samurai western. The curious, sloppy over-dubbing leaves some of the actors looking like foreigners in a spaghetti spy-drama, while Kelly implores us to remember that...yes...Poppy flowers are attractive and innocent-looking, but their seeds are producing drugs that are destroying our young people! Not as fast as films like this. E. G. Marshall's somewhat bemused performance is the only asset the picture has to offer. Also known as "The Poppy Is Also a Flower", "The Opium Connection" and (my favorite) "Danger Grows Wild". NO STARS from ****</p>
