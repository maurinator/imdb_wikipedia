<h1>Cinderella (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An adaptation of the fairy tale, Cinderella traces the misadventures of our heroine, who, via the help of her "fairy" (i.e. gay) godmother, is granted heightened sexual prowess to win over Prince Charming. After a blindfolded orgy at the royal castle, the nerdy Prince must sleep with every willing woman in his kingdom until he finds that one, mysterious lover who so "stood out" on the night of the sex Ball.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must admit I didn't expect to see the classic in this light when one of my girlfriend's brought this home from the rental office. At first, I thought it was a little crude, but as the movie went on and I started to get into enjoying for what it was - an entertaining (and somewhat risque) movie - I realized that it was actually quite a good and interesting movie. Imagine a Cinderella who was tested not by the ability to fit into a show, but the ability to bring the prince to sexual heights with an amazing female sexual organ. I pity (or is that envy?) the prince though, having to have sex with almost all the girls in the entire kingdom before being able to find his Cinderella!</p>
