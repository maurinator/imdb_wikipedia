<h1>Guinevere (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Connie, an aging Bohemian photographer, meets mousy Harper, headed for Harvard Law from a high-powered San Francisco family, and immediately sees her beauty. He also guesses she has talent and invites her to be his pupil and share his bed. He's Alfred Stieglitz, she's Georgia O'Keefe, and he calls her his Guinevere. When she realizes she's the latest Guinevere in a string of ingenues, she bolts, only to return, sick of her family. She's blossoming, reading, learning, but hasn't yet taken her first photograph when he tells her they're going to L.A., broke, him drinking too much, to sell some photographs. On the trip, she finally snaps the shutter; so does her awe and dependence.</p>
<p>A young girl from an affluent family rebels and becomes involved with a much older photographer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't say exactly what, but something is missing in this movie.  Poor Connie.  I think he gets less out of the relationships than the Guineveres.  Maybe I like things "tied up" too much, but I wish we'd seen a little of Harper's work so we could judge just how well Connie taught her.  A scene of her in a gallery or studio somewhere surrounded by her work as she answers a ringing telephone (presumably with Billie on the other end) would have been satisfying--no dialog necessary, just a look of sadness on her face.  Whatever else, this movie sure spurred some dialog between my 25-year-old daughter and me.Interesting that (along with another reviewer) I saw the connection between the Stephen Rea character, Connie, in this movie and Herman Wouk's Noel Airman in the 50's novel "Marjorie Morningstar" and talked about that as we walked home.  And as big a bitch as Harper's mother was, she had it right as she saw through Connie. Beautifully acted by all principals!</p>
