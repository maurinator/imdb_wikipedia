<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At breakfast, Jane announces that she and Ralph are getting married the next week. All Jane and Ralph want is a small wedding with the immediate family and no reception. This is because Janes parents are poor and Jane and Ralph can borrow a car for their honeymoon. However, at dinner that night all Ralph's parents talk about are the big weddings they gave their daughters and everything escalates. All of a sudden, it is a big wedding breakfast with hundreds of guests. The problem is that for 12 years, Tom has been saving money to buy his own cab and license, but now that he can, all of his money is going towards a wedding neither he, or Jane or Ralph really want.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Catered Affair" is a great little movie filled with real life heartache and genuine emotion. Bette gives a strong performance as the matriarch of the family determined to give her only daughter a proper wedding even though the family can't afford to do so. Ernest B. is perfectly cast as the slovenly, hard working taxi cab driver. In fact everyone is up to par in this film, but it's the real life situations that tug at your heart strings. Agnes' brother who sleeps on the couch in the living room, preparing a dinner to impress the future in-laws, Agnes' realization that one day it will be only her and Tom living in the apartment. An especially touching scene takes place in the bedroom as Agnes brushes her hair as Tom gives her many reasons why they can't afford the cost of the wedding, both financially and emotionally.</p>
