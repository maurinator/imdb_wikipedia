<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having first heard of this movie when writer/star Al Franken plugged it on "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live" during the season finale in 1986, I had long been curious about it and just now watched it on the Crackle site. He and partner Tom Davis play the leading members of rock band Badmouth who stop at St. Cloud, Minnesota, for a gig while various teenagers in town have their own adventures during one Saturday night. I'll stop there and just say that as the authors, Franken & Davis give nuanced style to the situations and characterizations that gradually takes one to heights of hilarity as the narrative goes on before once again going back to the subtler route. So don't expect the wacky hijinks of a Caddyshack or Wayne's World here. Which means the R-rating is mostly for a few scenes of the f-word being said. So on that note, I highly recommend One More Saturday Night. P.S. While Meshach Taylor is the only other cast member I recognized in name and face having watched "Designing Women" a lot, I had watched "China Beach" during the early seasons but was unaware that the woman who played Cherry there-Nan Woods-was Diane here. Besides her, other natives of my birthtown of Chicago that appeared here include Frank Howard, Nina Siemaszko, Mike Hagerty, and Nathan Davis who also died there (as did Second City veteran Del Close who played Mr. Schneider/Large Tattooed Man here). Oh, and much of the movie was shot around my birthtown.</p>
