<h1>Sia, the Dream of the Python (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Every year the most beautiful girl will be sacrificed to the Python God. But what really happens is that all the priests rape her, and then murder her, so that she cannot tell that the python god does not exist. When a girl named Sia is the next to be sacrificed, she hides in the house of the village idiot, a man who goes around shouting hyper-aggressive criticisms against everything. Sia is found by the soldiers and the village idiot is murdered. But the army commander had for some time prepared a revolt against the emperor. Now he murders the emperor and all the priests, thereby saving Sia from being raped. His plan is to make Sia's boyfriend the new emperor, an appointment to be justified by the lie that that boy had murdered the python god. At the same time Sia should be empress. However, Sia refuses to lie about what happened. Therefore she is declared a lunatic. In turn she develops exactly the same kind of behaviour as the village idiot had shown.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The story outline is simple and complex at the same time: A young girl is picked to be slaughtered as a human sacrifice tothe "Python God".  Her fiance is in the army at the front,  his uncle, head of the army,  delays the sacrifice until he returns to "say goodbye". This delay is supported by Sia's (the girl's) escape. In the end she is saved from death,  but the structure of "the state", the religiousbeliefs of the people, and in fact the love between Sia and her fiance are either ruined or turned out to be lies. In the struggle the state is overthrown,  but the heroes of the revolution immediately turn into a lying, power-hungry class themselves immediately.  In the end,  becoming mad seems to be the only way of keeping a clear view of the world...The movie supposed to be set in small village somewhere in central Africa. This village is basically "the state",  whose army is engaged in some trouble at "the front".  All sets, the town, the people are mere prototype and sometimes one has the impression of watching a theatre play instead of a movie,  yet the impression one cen get from the african life is very well made.  And the insiights into the internal entaglements, intrigues, lies and relationship of "the state"'s ruling class and the entire people are funny and alarmingly realistic at the same time.</p>
