<h1>Arisan! (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The lives of several upperclass, thirty-something Jakartans are boldly revealed for the first time in Indonesian cinema, following the career and social life of three life-long friends who seem to have conquered the metropolitan. Unfortunately, the truth is not exactly as pretty as the impression.</p>
<p>Friendship and principles are put to a test in the circle of Jakarta's social elite which can be as turbulent as the city's slums.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>well, i read the review before i write this comment. as an indonesian, i perfectly understand every single little joke in this movie. and i think this movie is quite hilarious. i watch it over and over again. i love surya saputra since around 1995. and he is a good actor (and singer). and tora sudiro is a brand new star. i love him in it. and i'm waiting for his upcoming projects, if there is any. cut mini, i thought she only does comedy stuffs. but she proved that she could act well in a serious role. rachel maryam, thumbs up for that gal. for the storyline, picture, dialog and everything. conclusion, this is the best indonesian movie i've ever seen.</p>
