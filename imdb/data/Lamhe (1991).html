<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I understand that the subject matter of LAMHE was controversial, and I understand why. Yet it's a watchable film that deals with confronting matters of the heart. It's a very Bollywood film with plenty of color and music/dancing within the first 10 minutes, but it's got twists and turns worthy of Tour de France. Shockingly there's not one kiss exchanged in this - maybe I never noticed when watching other films from India that it might be a cultural no-no - but it doesn't detract from a well- played story with some pretty heavy drama. At least five times, my jaw dropped as a plot twist quickly redefined the film. Save for one, they were moments that I didn't see coming, but I guess were necessary to keep a film running for over three hours.Sridevi did a great job to express the feelings while in character. And you could almost fall in love with her yourself, with the smile and those huge doe-like eyes. I can get a little frustrated with how some of the characters try manipulating others, but the subject matter of love begs for some people to question that love. I'm trying to be as vague as possible so as not to spoil this. If you have a chance to watch LAMHE, avoid reading spoilers, they will really destroy your watching experience.</p>
