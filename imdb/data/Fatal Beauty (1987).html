<h1>Fatal Beauty (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rita Rizzoli is a narcotics police officer with a plethora of disguises. When a drug shipment is hijacked, the thieves don't know that the drug is unusually pure and packs of "Fatal Beauty" begin turning up next to too many dead bodies. Mike Marshak works for the original owner of the drugs and tries to tell himself that since he does not handle the drugs, he is "clean". Mike becomes Rita's constant companion as the drug hijackers (who are nearly psychotic and very well armed) are hunted, while more and more bodies continue to turn up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cher was supposed to play this part and left to be replaced with Whoopi that is probably why this is an odd film. She(Cher ) and Sam Elliott became friendly doing the film "Mask" and wanted to work again. For some unknown reason Cher left at the last minute. Whoopi was "hot" at the time(box office wise) and was offered the part. She should have turned it down. Although she is a good actor,to use her for a part that was tailored for Cher is a bit silly. Proof,once again, that Hollywood producers can make some strange decisions. These events become legendary.Marlon Brando for the "Sundance kid". Thank God cooler heads prevailed.Or,Robert Evans fighting for Alan Delone for the part of Michael in the "Godfather"</p>
