<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a perfect blend of bad writing and a cheesy plot.  Somehow, the acting was decent and they managed to scrounge up Daniel Stern and John Heard (both of which who were in respectable movies before this).  There was also a cameo role from John Goodman. It was a great movie.  It is like a bad dream come true, and you can't really admit to liking this, but admit it, you do!  You cannot go wrong with people living in the subway and monsters eating people left and right because of a toxic sewage problem under New York.</p>
