<h1>The Hours and Times (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A fictionalized account of what may have happened when John Lennon and Brian Epstein went on holiday together to Spain in 1963.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's basically what you would expect from it.  The director must have had kept John Lennon's thought on the matter of him and Brian having that vacation together.  He said that, "It was NEVER consummated.  But we did have a PRETTY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP."  This was carried out through the whole film, even in the famous bathroom scene.  Over all I enjoyed the film for the fact that it went along with the little bits of facts and never exaggerated them.  This is close to the real thing of what might have happened those couple of days.</p>
