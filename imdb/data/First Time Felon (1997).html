<h1>First Time Felon (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Inspired by the true story of Greg Yance. In the film, Yance (Epps) is a hood who goes to jail for possession of drugs. He is given a choice: 5 years in jail or a couple of months in boot camp. He chooses boot camp and finds out it is tougher than he thought it would be. He braves it through and comes home a better man. He then has to deal with the real world, and never gives up no matter what the odds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This TV movie is a bleak but insightful look at how a young black American copes with and ultimately benefits from being sent to a Boot Camp instead of prison. I did enjoy this movie as it took us into the dark and depressing life of a young African American but it could have been so much better. I would have liked the relationship with the two gang Bangers to have been explored a little bit more and we could also have done without the slushy sentimental bit in the middle of the film.I had never heard of the actor Omar Epps and I was impresssed with him in the lead role. Over all a good movie. 7 out of 10.</p>
