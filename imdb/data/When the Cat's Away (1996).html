<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the brightest films Ive seen recently. The main character loses her cat and the whole town looks for it. I was feeling a little like a different film when I saw it in the video store. I cant even remember why I picked it, the others thought it wouldnt be so good. It was however amazing, all the little stories, the search for the cat and the loneliness she felt with or without the cat were beautiful. Well worth watching</p>
