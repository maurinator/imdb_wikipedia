<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Caboblanco" is a nice and rare treat for any Bronson/Robards/Thompson fan. Don't believe what every review says. There are only a few movies where Bronson puts down the gun and turns up his acting charm. Throughout out the 80s, he starred in a huge bunch of Cannon Popcorn-Actioners. They where just mindless and fun comic book thrillers. "Caboblanco" is one of the few Bronson suspense films where he gives an all-star performance. He doesn't need to be in an action film to give a solid performance. His scenes with Dominique Sanda are a joy and fun to watch and his scenes with Robards the greatest in the film.Like any good movie, it did have it's flaws. "Caboblanco" has been labeled as an action film and a "remake" of "Casablanca." I highly disagree with both. It's more of a suspense/drama. The plot was a little boring and some scenes are just that. Of coarse, it's not a real Bronson movie without some violence, so there are a few action scenes placed nicely in the film. He throws quite a few punches and handles a gun here and there. But like I said earlier, it's not about the action in this movie. There are a few DVD copies on the net, so if your a hardcore Bronson/Robards/Thompson fan, I recommend you check this out. Although, there are a few boring scenes, it's a well made suspense/drama with a great cast. Scenes with Bronson and Robards are the best if the film! They make a great team. 10/10</p>
