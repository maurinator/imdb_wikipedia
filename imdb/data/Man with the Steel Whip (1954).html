<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And this still comes off as one of the best in Republic's declining years, and having the voice and presence of Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, in the form of Richard Simmons, didn't hurt it any, especially when compared to those with Harry Lauter or Myron Healy as the lead.Most of the "El Latiago" riding scenes and cliffhangers featuring the character came from 1944's "Zorro's Black Whip", which means Linda Stirling's double in that serial, Babe De Freest, doubled Simmons (via stock footage) about as much as his assigned double on this serial, Tom Steele. With the exception of a couple of short instances (when footage from "The Painted Stallion" was utilized,) all the Indian attacks on wagon trains, wagon chases, town-street establishing shot, and Cavalry scenes came from 1943's "Daredevils of the West", especially in Chapter Two when that serial's doubles for Allan Lane, Kay Aldridge and Eddie Acuff occupy most of the running time.Chapter 10 serves as this serials "cheater" chapter when Richard Simmmons catches Sheriff Roy Barcroft up on events (saloon fight) in Chapter One and earlier chapters.All in all, this would have made a better serial to end Republic's string than the two that followed.</p>
