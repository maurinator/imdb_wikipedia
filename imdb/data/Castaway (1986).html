<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie again! It has a beautiful sea-side setting, that has been explored from "Robinson Crusoe" to "The Black Stallion" to "Summerfield". That's apart from reading "Coral Island" & "Lord of the Flies" as a school-boy & such as TV-series as diverse as "The Count of Monte Christo" to "Gillian's Island". Since I enjoyed all of these, I fell into the familiar surrounds with abandon!Supposedly, it's based on a true story, but I would think some of what's presented is unlikely, like the willingness of the beautiful young woman to embark on such a reckless voyage of discovery, & having been caused to enter into a contract involving marriage in the process. These are merely introductions into the nature of the potential partners evolving, but they attempt to serve each other & at times, seem quite close. But they are in an Adam 'n' Eve-type scenario of ambivalence. So the hostilities between them do not take long to surface! And they dare to reflect remarkable similarities to the difficulties & modern complexities we are all part of, in our respective worlds, as islands, within islands, of government religion & media domains, almost always beyond our control, operate.So we have a movie here, a little over 20 years old as I write this, which invites the viewer to see a microcosm of the world that surrounds us everyday as we live & watch TV & visit the cinema! A bit ahead of its time, I would suggest! So, in the process of preparing this, I have upgraded my rating of it from 8 to 9 out of 10. Relationships are complex & its ending is rather sudden, but I felt I'd been on a good journey overall in watching this & didn't regret having re-visited this idyllic wilderness of natural beauty! Easy on the eye & yet not failing to note the turbulence all around!</p>
