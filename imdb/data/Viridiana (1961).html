<h1>Viridiana (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Viridiana, a young novice about to take her final vows as a nun, accedes to a request from her widowed uncle to visit him. Moved purely by a sense of obligation, she does so. Her uncle is moved by her resemblance to his late wife to attempt to seduce Viridiana, and tragedy ensues. In the aftermath, Viridiana tries to assuage her guilt by creating a haven for the destitute folk who live around her uncle's estate. But from these good intentions, too, comes little good.</p>
<p>A young postulant, Viridiana, is about to take her final vows as a nun and reluctantly visits an uncle, her only relative, even though she can barely remember him. He is most welcoming but when it comes time for her to return to the convent he insists that she stay with him. In fact, he's become quite infatuated with the young woman and wants to marry her, something she flatly refuses to do. He even takes to drugging her to keep her near him, but she will not bend to his will, leading to tragedy. Now alone, Viridiana does her best to help help the poor but nothing turns out as she had hoped.</p>
<p>Virdiana is a novice at a Spanish convent. She finds comfort in the solitude of the convent life. Before Viridiana takes her vows and remains cloistered within the convent walls as a nun, the Mother Superior directs her to make one last extended visit to her Uncle Jaime at his farm, this the last time she will probably ever see him before he eventually dies. Despite Uncle Jaime having paid for her education, Viridiana is reluctant to visit him both because of her discomfort outside the convent and never having felt close to him, he who she's only met once in her life. Viridiana's visit with Uncle Jaime leads to some actions and decisions with disastrous and sometimes tragic consequences and/or results. One of those decisions is Viridiana's change of mind in not returning to the convent - solely because she feels she can no longer do so - and redirecting her work in the name of God to the down and out in the nearby village. And one of Uncle Jaime's actions leads to the return of his adult estranged son, Jorge, whose presence at the farm may be in stark contrast to Viridiana's wants, again all in the name of God.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Forty years on and `Viridiana' is one of the very few, almost unique, examples of classical Spanish cinema to have survived the turmoil of the latter half of the last century. It remains as a little light in the midst of the darkness of the Franco Régime, which promptly banned it, or as an insouciance to the Vatican, which promptly excomulgated everyone concerned with it.Buñuel's genius is apparent in every frame: the eye for detail, nonetheless permitting that impromptu evanesqueness which lends exquisiteness to these memorable scenes, above which shines the `Last Supper'. And it is precisely this scene which gives one the impression that the real stars in the making of this film were the motley beggars taken in from the streets. Silvia Pinal and Francisco `Paco' Rabal are not outstanding in this piece; even the incomparable Fernando Rey is overshadowed by the band of social outcasts. The sheer poeticness so brilliantly captured by the camera roaming among the vagabonds is cinematographic exquisiteness carried to its extreme: every grimace, every wrinkled nose, the debauchery, is what makes the principal actors be no such thing, but secondary actors overwhelmed by the nuances and gestures of these `untouchables". Brilliant filming, indeed  whether intentional or not or whether this be only my personal interpretation after seeing this film three times in the last twenty five years, is of course open to debate. Suffice just to mention Lola Gaos: (Tristana (1970)  also by Buñuel - is one of her other films worthy of mention, surprisingly accepted by the censor's blue pen). In the 70s her voice began to break up, such that in the end she lived out her last years in poverty, forgotten by the times and cinema makers, until hauled out of hiding for a last TV appearance, sardonic way of giving her a few pennies to eke out to the end of her existence, but by then  (1989) her voice was so fragmented it was near impossible to understand her. Her throat-cancer was never treated adequately. Luis Buñuel (`Thank God I am an atheist') has gone; Fernando Rey has gone; Paco Rabal died yesterday in an aeroplane flying over the English Channel, returning from the Montreal Film Festival where he received his last award.They leave `Viridiana' as testament to those historical and difficult times, an isolated exposé amid what was, for Spain, a cinematographical desert.</p>
