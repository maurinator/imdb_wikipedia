<h1>Waqt (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Members of a family are separated in a natural disaster. Several years down the line, they aren't united but their lives are strangely interconnected.</p>
<p>This is simply a movie about "Time". No one knows what tommorrow shall bring. In the movie as the clock turns a wealthy family becomes separated and this movie describes their descent from their former position.</p>
<p>Lala Kedarnath is in the process of celebrating the grand opening of his business with his wife, Laxmi, and three children, all sons, when an earthquake devastates the region, separating his family from him. Decades later, this family assembles in a courtroom where Kedarnath is a witness for the prosecution; one son, Ravi, is the defense lawyer; another son, Vijay Kumar, is another witness for the prosecution, who has been bribed to lie and implicate the accused; and the eldest son, the accused, Raja, is the one charged with murder, a charge that may result in the death sentence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one movie, that whenever I have watched, has always brought tears in my eyes and that is probably because, not only does it remind me of my childhood days and going to the cinema, in this case the "Drive  In" in Kenya with my parents but also because of the music, the songs, the acting and the story."Waqt" means time and this is what the Director, has really shown in this movie  time. From the moment, a man is informed that one never knows what is going to happen next and he laughs it off, it sets the tone of the story. Moments later the family experience an earthquake and the whole family gets separated.Starring Balraj Sahni, Achala Sachdev, Raj Kumar, Sadhana, Shashi Kapoor, Sharmila Tagore, Sunil Dutt, Motilal, Jeevan, Madan Puri, Leela Chitnis and Rehman, the movie is directed by Yash Chopra and is produced by BR Chopra. The superb music is by Ravi.This movie set the tone for the future hits, such as "Yaadon Ki Baraat" and "Amar Akbar Anthony," where the brothers get separated and not only this but this also involved romance as well.The late Balraj Sahini, I would say is at his very best here as are Sunil Dutt, Raj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor and all the other cast as well. Raj Kumar is just perfect in his role as a thief as is Sunil Dutt as a lawyer and Shashi Kapoor as a driver and the direction by Yash Chopra is just superb. The songs, and especially the one sung by Balraj Sahni, and the playback by Manna Dey, "Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen," are most memorable  all of them as is the one, "Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu," by Asha Bhonsle, as well.Waqt was commercially a very successful film when released and the settings of this just shows how much the late BR Chopra, elder brother of Yash Chopra, was fond of the Hollywood style golden age by use of pink and blue walls, fountains, circular beds and mirrored ceilings and with his he also manages to capture the opulent lifestyle of many in what is now Mumbai.This is one film that is worth watching whenever one can even if it is on a DVD or television.</p>
