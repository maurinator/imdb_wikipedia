<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This solid thriller deals about a down-home cop(Michael Douglas)accused of corruption and his young partner(Andy Garcia). They witness a grisly killing by a Japonese murderer named Sato(Matsuda). They pursuit him and barely escape with their life, but get detain him. They're assigned to protect him but with painful results when the mobster is transported to Osaka. Then they are assigned to upright Inspector(Ken Takatura) and forced into action against Yazuka. Thus starts a clash of culture and a cobweb of intrigue which keep the spectators on the edge of their seats.This is a superb, though predictable at times, blending of tough American police genre and Japanese gangsters by means an organization called Yazuka, a kind of oriental Mafia .Michael Douglas as down-and-out police and Ken Takatura are honorable Inspector are very fine . Good secondaries actors such as Andy Garcia and Kate Capshaw, Spileberg's wife. Appear uncredited John Spencer as the chief official and Luis Guzman. This first rate suspenseful action pic benefits from intelligent screenplay and visual dynamics, however is overlong, two hours and some. This special buddy-movie is full of neon lights from Osaka with a videoclip and advertisement spots style . The motion picture is glamorously directed by Ridley Scott as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film(Someone to watch over me) and others(Blade runner,Duelists , Legend) in which his visual style is impressive.</p>
