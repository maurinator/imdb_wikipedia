<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eleven-year-old Maria loses her little brother to cancer. Her mother retreats into deep depression; her father attempts to keep the family emotionally afloat. Sent to her grandparents' home for the summer, Maria meets Jacob, also an eleven-year-old, but with a completely different attitude to life and loss - he is an outgoing, adventurous latch-key kid with wisdom way beyond his tender years. Their budding friendship helps Maria reach out to her mother so that they can mourn and heal together.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Bare skyer beveger stjernene" is a beautiful little piece about a girl dealing with her brother's death while the family temporarily disintegrates. At the same time she meets a boy and finds some sort of first bonding/love.Sounds simple, but it really works, due to solid natural sounding dialogue, somber editing, wonderful photography, excellent chemistry and directing - and not much over-acting, even from the children's main characters. (Unnatural over-acting is a huge problem in Norwegian movies - they are often populated with Theodore actors who act too much, and with sometimes surprisingly weak dialogue that no normal people would say in reality. If you think I exaggerate, just watch "Buddy".) I would say this is one of the best Norwegian movies from the 90's, and quite underestimated. It's a shame it's not out on DVD (yet), but let's hope someone manages to get it out in widescreen, DTS-sound and with foreign subtitles. It deserves to be seen by many more! (This review is based on my memory of seeing the movie in 1998 - I hope it's still valid if I see it again now.)</p>
