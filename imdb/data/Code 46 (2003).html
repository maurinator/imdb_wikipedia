<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>intuition is the key for true knowledge...code 46 is a story set in a post apocalyptic atmosphere in the near future.It is consisting of many levels, and one can analyze the story in terms of sociology, politics,naturalistic ideas and in terms of love. The story is about an "intuition man" looking for a "corrupt" worker of a company that provides pass for people.However, she is helping out people to achieve their dreams and the company is actually limiting the people in terms of the places they can go on earth.The intuition man finds out who provides pass for people "illegelly" but does not give her away. He falls in love with her and the story unfolds...The movie asks a lot of questions like "if you know the consequences of your actions, would you still do the same thing in the first place?" to be answered.At this point, the audience should consider the nature of the characters. One of them is the intuition man( according to Foucault, intuition is the key for true knowledge) the other is a girl having dreams (consider Freud) and there are several reflections on humanity that we are all interconnected...The search for spiritual freedom in the world is a dominant concept in the film.The course of life of the characters are proficiently reflected through out the movie. As a director, Michael Winterbottom puts out an excellent work of art. His visual style in reflecting the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is worth admiration. All in all, this is a movie to be watched again and again...</p>
