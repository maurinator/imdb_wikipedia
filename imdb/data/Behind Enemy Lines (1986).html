<h1>Behind Enemy Lines (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>US Airborne colonel James Cooper accepts a daredevil mission to liberate just before the impending end of the Vietnamese war some POW's which the Vietcong refuses to exchange, from a camp that officially doesn't even exist. he alone survives the blowing up up his team's extraction helicopter and is captured himself. The Vietcong camp commander, captain Vinh, collected a small fortune in gold looted from POWs and wants to buy a new life in the US, so he offers Cooper freedom for help, but is turned down. Just before a convoy arrives to deport the prisoners to Hanoi, Cooper accepts if all Americans may come with them. An adventurous chase follows, fighting each-other as well as Vietcong, not to mention selfish rogue Sparks's tendency to mess everything up. Near the border, Cooper insists to come to the rescue of a trapped US unit's survivors.</p>
<p>Col. Carradine leads a group of American P.O.W.s, battling their way to freedom as Saigon falls to the Viet Cong.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>David Carradine makes you believe a laid back lethargic soldier can become a one man killing machine in the jungles of the 'Nam. This film is lots of fun, anybody expecting military and historical accuracy will suffer the same kind of disappointment as someone expecting to see David Carradine perform with all the speed and agility of Bruce Lee.Carradine and his fellow P.O.W.s suffer at the hands of a VC officer who secretly harbors a desire for the American dream, he demands that Carradine aid him in achieving it. Instead the Tai Chi expert and the dependable Steve James (you could pair James up with Hugh Grant and still be guaranteed victory) serve up a healthy dose of mayhem and sends Charlie running most ricki tik. If you've run out of Chuck Norris war films to watch, P.O.W. the Escape will fill the void.</p>
