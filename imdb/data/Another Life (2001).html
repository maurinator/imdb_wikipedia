<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Performances are fine but there is something that is not quite working and I caught myself wondering away a few times during the film. Good reconstruction of the middle class edwardian England and different to see in compare of nobility and high class that is usually portrayed in edwardian stories. Applause to Little for the variety of emotions but Ioan Gruffudd is focused and passionate, giving a certain rhythm that is often generally lacking.</p>
