<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't understand why the hell the other viewers don't like this movie. I loved it, really. A so unusual and moving story that reminds me the US features from the seventies, in the Monte Hellman line. I would have imagined Warren Oates in one of the characters, the cop one, for instance. OK, it's slow, and so incredible, but sorry, but I loved this one, I repeat. Good performances and also a so pessimistic story which I would have expected more optimistic, and I usually crave for downbeat tales. I don't think this movie was known outside the Aussies land. So shame. Anyway, I recommend it. And, as many other Australian movies, this story emphasizes on the open lands of this country, the famous outback, the bush. The famous bush. I don't know the director.</p>
