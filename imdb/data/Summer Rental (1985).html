<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie every time they show it on Comedy Central or USA or TNT.  This movie is classic John Candy all the way. Candy has scenes, no matter how many I times I watch, that make me laugh so hard I fall from my chair.  Like when he kicks all the people out of his house wielding a crutch. Sure the story may be weak and a little corny with the whole boat race but it ranks up there among my favorites.It has some other memorable moments including Rip Torn's character of Scully.  My of my favorite parts is when he is teaching Jack (played by Candy) to sail.  They are on the boat late at night and they are both drunk. Scully announces to jack, "Here's and little ditty me mother used to sing to me", at which point he breaks into "The Theme from Love Boat" and Jack joins in with him.  And then there is the scenes between Scully and Angus when Scully refers to Angus as a "dumb Swede" even though he is a Scot.It is a good rainy day rental.</p>
