<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brian G. Hutton's "High Road To China" is a classic example of good old fashioned chemistry.  Lost-generation flapper hires boozy WW-I flying ace to help find her father, lost somewhere in China, to avoid losing her inheritance.  You just know that they will eventually get together, and plenty of facial expressions and body language promise an ending that eventually delivers.  Some great scenery and flying scenes, and burly he-manning from Brian Blessed, keep you in stitches.  If this had been filmed in black and white in the 40s, it would have been up there with Casablanca, et al. Lots of low-expectation fun.</p>
