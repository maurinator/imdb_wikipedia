So they try to do their best to survive in the Big Apple before competition, and get some lessons about the real World.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this movie over and over and over when I was a kid. I wish I could still find it somewhere today. It's not for sale on Amazon, Netflix doesn't have it.I loved the story and the music. But that was more than 20 years ago now, so I don't know what I think of it as an adult.In all honesty, I might hate it now. But as a child, I loved trying to copy the dance moves. I thought Erin Gray was in this, but I don't see her on the cast list. If anyone knows where I can find this or has a copy to sell, please let me know. I highly recommend it if you can find it anywhere.</p>
