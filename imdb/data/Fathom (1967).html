<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Southern Spain with a U.S. team, skydiver Fathom Harvill is approached by a Scottish colonel working for a top-secret Western agency.

Apart from all this there is a predatory continental doctor on his yacht to take account of. Fathom soon realizes nothing is what it seems to be, but can she fathom the truth out?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Terrific spy spoof with tongue-in-cheek dialogue.  Breezy in every sense of the word.  Everyone's timing is wonderfully in-synch.  Cleo Laine's husband, Johnny Dankworth provides just the right kind of smirky jazzy score.  The entire supporting cast is well-cast and delivers wonderfully.  Tony Franciosa makes a perfect leading man for her in his own breezy style.But, Raquel, her array of fun-loving smiles, her bikinis, her attitude, her sparkling eyes, and poppet-like expressions are what makes this movie a guilty-pleasure classic for me.  She wiggles, jiggles, plays dumb, acts smart, empathises, exercises, sky-dives, and always but always, smiles.  And, dare I say it?  What a magnificent body!!!</p>
