The Enterprise manages to save a handful of the ships' passengers and barely succeeds out intact... but at the cost of Captain Kirk's life. 78 years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the Enterprise-D crew find themselves at odds with renegade scientist Dr. Tolian Soran... who is destroying entire star systems. Only one man can help Picard stop Soran's scheme... and he has been dead for 78 years.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Though nearly all would disagree - especially Star Trek fans - I consider this the best of the Star Trek movies and the best science-fiction film of the nineties. I had no problem with the storyline which many found weak, laughed up a storm at the humour, loved the musical score, was dazzled by the special effects, was impressed by the acting (superior to that of the cast of the older series), and recognised the climax at the correct point in the film - the meeting of Kirk and Picard - old and new captains of the Enterprise. I preferred this film, the seventh installment in the Star Trek films, to the eighth episode "First Contact" which I found over-acted and containing unnecessary decline in the rectitude of the crew.</p>
