<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Paris, 1969. The filming of a sci-fi movie set in the distant year 2000 is in trouble. The director's obsession with the actress who plays the sexy secret agent Dragonfly has clouded his judgment and the film has no ending. A young American, in Paris to document his life on film with total honesty, is brought in to finish the movie with a bang. This proves to be difficult when the line between his fantasy life and reality becomes blurred, and he finds himself seduced by the charms of Dragonfly.</p>
<p>1969. American Paul Ballard, living in Paris with his French flight attendant girlfriend Marlene, is a film editor by trade. He is an aspiring filmmaker in his own right, he filming his and Marlene's day-to-day interactions so that he may get a better grasp on himself and their hot and cold relationship, despite Marlene believing the film is self-indulgent not worth anyone else's time. The latest film on which Paul has been hired as editor and on which he is also second unit director is an English language futuristic sex kitten action-adventure film set in Paris in the year 2001.

<p>A young filmmaker in 1960s Paris juggles directing a cheesy sci-fi debacle, directing his own personal art film, coping with his crumbling relationship with his girlfriend, and a new-found infatuation with the sci-fi film's starlet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>CQ was the worst film I saw this year.  Nearly every film I choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say.  This film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his Intro. to Filmmaking class.  His father makes great films.  His sister made a good one.  But brother Roman?  NO!  One critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godard's Le MÃ©pris (Contempt).  While Coppola, Jr. did take the same idea, a film about film, he tried too hard to make himself seem European, artsy, and witty, when it's all really just kitsch.  The lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film, like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him.  Schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director.  Depardieu is alright.  The one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is, surprisingly, not the B-movie scenes, but rather one which takes place in Italy; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and dropping off random people.  This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I am guessing he was trying to spoof.  Or rip-off.  Or both.  The documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out, the ending was tagged on for the sake of a "twist" or artistic value...  I suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself, and not in the way it intended.  No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever, which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before.  I can't believe it could have been worse than this.  If you want to see a good parody of film check out the Austin Powers films.  Any of them.  The opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film.  Lil' Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to directing your cousin's music videos.  Leave The Godfathers to daddy.</p>
