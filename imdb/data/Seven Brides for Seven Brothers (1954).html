<h1>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Adam, the eldest of seven brothers, goes to town to get a wife. He convinces Milly to marry him that same day. They return to his backwoods home. Only then does she discover he has six brothers - all living in his cabin. Milly sets out to reform the uncouth siblings, who are anxious to get wives of their own. Then, after reading about the Roman capture of the Sabine women, Adam develops an inspired solution to his brothers' loneliness.</p>
<p>In 1850, in the Oregon Territory, the provincial farmer Adam Pontipee comes to the town to trade supplies and find a wife. When he meets the strong hard worker Milly working in a bar, he proposes her. Milly has a crush on Adam and marries him, expecting to have her own place with her husband. However, when they arrive in the distant farm, she leans that Adam is the eldest of seven unsophisticated and rude brothers. Milly educates the brothers, teaching them hygiene, good manners and how to win somebody's heart. In the annual town picnic, Milly, Adam and his six brothers go to the party and each of his brothers fall in love for a girl. However, they have to return to the loneliness of their farm. In the winter, Adam reads Plutarch and tells his brothers about "The Rape of the Sabine Women", when the Roman men had abducted wives for themselves from the Sabine families. He travels with his brothers to the town and they kidnap their beloved girls. When they cross a gorge, they provoke a snow avalanche and block the narrow passage. However, Milly keeps the girls in the house and sends Adam and his brothers to the barn. But until the spring, when the passage will be open again, many things happen in the farm with Milly, Adam, his brothers and their "brides".</p>
<p>On one of his few trips into town per year, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee has a larger shopping list than usual. On his shopping list this time is a wife, not only a beautiful woman, but one that can cook and clean and transform his pigsty of a farm into a real home. Against the odds, he does find one in the form of Millie, the headstrong cook at the local inn. For her, it's love at first sight. Upon arriving at Adam's farm in the Oregon mountains, Millie finds her new lot in life is not only as loving wife, but housemaid to Adam's six brothers, who all live at the farm. The Pontipee's are rough and tumble and ill mannered as they haven't been exposed to much in life outside their remote farm. Adam's new life and a trip into town themselves inspires the six brothers to find wives of their own. Adam and Millie each have differing views on how best to achieve the brothers' collective wish. As the six unmarried brothers strive to achieve their goal, Adam may lose his in taking his wife for granted.</p>
<p>In 1850 Oregon, when a backwoodsman brings a wife home to his farm, his six brothers decide that they want to get married too.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A permanent place in the history of film musicals is obviously the fate of 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' the minute Howard Keel begins to sing 'Bless Your Beautiful Hide'. His robust romantic presence and voice are perfectly suited to blend with Jane Powell's sweet soprano--the Nelson and Jeanette of the '50s era. Jane is as perky as can be as the girl who impulsively marries him only to find that she's expected to keep house for him and his seven handsome brothers. (Echos of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' here and a touch of political incorrectness). But all that can be forgiven, for what follows is the most outrageously entertaining musical treat from the MGM factory--singin' and dancin' like you've never seen before! The exuberant acrobatic dancing of the brothers is a special highlight--particularly during the barnraising sequence. And their wistful rendering of the carefully staged 'Lonesome Polecat' is another high point. Powell and Keel get to warble some enchanting tunes and both are totally charming and professional in their roles. Keel probably never had a better role--except perhaps 'Showboat' or 'Annie Get Your Gun', handsome, macho and utterly believable. By all means reward yourself with this gem--either in regular format or widescreen, it's certainly one of the greatest MGM musicals of the '50s. Perhaps, as others have noted, the only drawbacks are some of the obviously painted mountain backgrounds--but this never destroys the overall charm of the film. The songs are splendid and the dances are as zestful as any you're ever likely to see.</p>
