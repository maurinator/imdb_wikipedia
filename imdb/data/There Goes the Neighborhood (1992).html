He has no time to be sad about it because an old man, who is very ill, tells him something about a robbery and the millions of dollars hidden somewhere. The old man asks Willis to find it and give a part of it to his relative, and he can keep the rest. In the next door some bad guy hears it and this causes the complications ...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'd give this movie an 8 for an original story, good acting, and some funny moments. The movie is certainly not a classic, but Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara are both excellent and the movie has some genuinely funny moments.The thing that really makes this movie, though, is the supporting cast. Jeremy Piven has a funny, albeit small role. Hector Elizondo is funny as a scheming husband. Chazz Palminteri shows off some comedy chops and has some funny moments. While the gangsters are stereotypical, it does result in some laughs.Overall, this movie won't be among the all time greats nor will it necessarily make your top 10, but it is a good, funny movie to watch and worth the price of a rental.</p>
