<h1>Last Orders (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack Dodd was a London butcher who enjoyed a pint with his mates for over 50 years. When he died, he died as he lived, with a smile on his face watching a horse race on which he had bet, with borrowed money. But before he died he had a final request, 'Last Orders', that his ashes be scattered in the sea at Margate. The movie follows his mates, Ray, Lenny and Vic and his son Vince as they journey to the sea with the ashes. Along the way, the threads of their lives, their loves and their disappointments are woven together in their memories of Jack and his wife Amy</p>
<p>1989, South London. Jack, an ebullient butcher, has died, and his last orders are to cast his ashes off the Margate Pier. His wife of 50 years, Amy, stays home, with the excuse of a visit to their mentally-disabled daughter. Jack's three closest friends, Ray, Vic, and Lenny - along with Jack's son Vince - head for Margate. Each has memories of Jack and of friendships, family, and conflicts. It's Vince's relationship with his dad that's the most complex, and Ray's long friendship with both Jack and Amy that holds things together. The last orders - to go to Margate and strew the ashes - become an invitation to recall what's done, what's left, and what's important.</p>
<p>A group of old friends reminisce about their lives over the years after the death of one of their crew.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's funny to read the reviews of those who haven't understood this perfectly balanced film - but then it is clever and subtle and, apart from being sad and touching is extremely funny.I've seldom seen characters, situations, attitudes and emotions more perfectly balanced than in this shining gem of a film. It took me right back to Pom and, in particular, the best, most understated delights of the place.There were so many sensitively treated sub-plots and topics that it is difficult to select one for particular praise. I think that it would have to be the adultery.</p>
