<h1>The Learning Tree (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story, set in Kansas during the 1920s, covers less than a year in the life of a black teenager, and documents the veritable deluge of events which force him into sudden manhood. The family relationships and enmities, the fears, frustrations and ambitions of the black teenager in small-town America are explored with a strong statement about human values.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I totally disagree with the previous review that says this movie has been white washed. Had he done his research he would know this was written and directed by a black man. He may need to take into account that this was filmed in 1969. This is how films from that time looked. The sets and costumes for films like Moses and Cleopatra weren't exactly realistic. I will agree that the acting isn't the greatest, but the story is good. There isn't any stereotyping in this movie, they have blacks and whites of different classes and backgrounds. Ever black isn't shiftless and and all of the whites aren't racist. I think it is a fair depiction of what blacks went through and the frustration they felt at that time. Its not the greatest movie I have seen, but it think it's worth watching.</p>
