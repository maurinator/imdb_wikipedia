<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'll keep this short; read msa0510's review for a more in-depth review.  The best part in this movie is Slim Pickens.  Just thinking about his scenes makes me start laughing again.It was nice having the "Making of 1941" on the dvd and seeing the remarks by Spielberg; I knew this movie had been panned by the critics but I hadn't known that it was popular in Europe.  I can't understand why we Americans don't find it funny; it's hysterically funny to me.It's a perfect 10 in my book; so few comedies these days are so over-the-top funny as this movie is.</p>
