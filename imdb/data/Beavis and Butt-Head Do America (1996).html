<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Our intrepid adolescent heroes wake up to find their beloved television stolen, and embark on an epic journey across America to recover it, and, who knows, maybe even score. On the way they encounter a murderous smuggler of a deadly virus and his treacherous wife, an FBI agent with a predilection for cavity searches, a couple of rather familiar looking ex-Motley Crue roadies, Mr. Van Dreesen singing "Lesbian Seagull", a little old lady and of course Mr. Anderson and his trailer. Can the Great Cornholio save the day? Uh-huh. Huh-huh.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am sure if you watched Beavis and Butt-head on television you had to see this movie. Mike Judge is excellent, his stuff is very enjoyable and funny. I know a lot of people think Beavis and Butt-head are the worst thing ever, but it is down right hilarious stuff in my book.</p>
