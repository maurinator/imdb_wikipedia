<h1>Seven Days to Noon (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An English scientist runs away from a research center with an atomic bomb. In a letter sent to the British Prime Minister he threatens to blow up the center of London if the Government don't announce the end of any research in this field within a week. Special agents from Scotland Yard try to stop him, with help from the scientist's assistant future son-in-law to find and stop the mad man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent suspense thriller!  Kindly old Prof Bullington (Barry Jones) gives the British government an ultimatum- unless they cease all atomic testing by the weekend, he will set off an A-Bomb in the center of London. Andre Morell heads the task force to find "the needle in one helluva haystack."  Done in a documentary style that shoves the details and urgency of a great manhunt onto the audience.  However, the human element of the story (i.e what Bullington's daughter has to go through, the dear sweet ol' actress Bullington holds captive, and the mass evacuation of London) is not lost for a millisecond.  Superb acting (Especially by Morell and Jones) and writing.  Do not miss!!</p>
