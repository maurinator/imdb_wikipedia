<h1>Aphrodite (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry is a young millionaire on holiday; he takes his yacht to a Greek island, and stays in the mansion of his friend, Count Orloff. The Count organizes a feast there, for three days and three nights, which is the reenactment of the love cult of the Goddess Aphrodite. Harry will meet Pauline there, a young woman who becomes his goddess... (Loosely based on Pierre Lou√Øs's novel, "Aphrodite".)</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Setting this piece of period drivel in 1914 suggests that the creators were trying to add significance by telling a tale of upper class decadence as Europe teetered on the brink of war, but chalk this up as another in a long list of failed ambitions for this piece of drek. Every erotic taste is featured here: voyeurism, costumes, role-playing and partner-swapping as events lead up to the main event, a re-creation of a classical Greek orgy. However, while the settings are pretty to look at, the performances are so drab, the script so lacking in energy and wit and the direction so pedestrian that it all makes for a boring, empty spectacle. Plus, the English-dubbed North American version appears to be a few minutes shorter than the European version, indicating some scissoring by censors. Avoid.</p>
