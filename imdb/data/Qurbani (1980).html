<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Qurbani means 'sacrifice' and here it's about one man's sacrifice of his love for his friend (never mind if the girl, he loves ,was in any case already in love with the friend!) Anyways, the movie was a big hit of the year, primarily because of the music and a pleasantly surprize performance from Amjad Khan who plays a gum-chewing inspector constantly on the heels of both the heroes in the movie. Feroze khan carries on his Clint-Eastwood hangover in this movie as well, but does not disappoint. Vinod Khanna , highly under-rated in his times, comes up with a good performance. Zeenat is supposed to look sexy and she does that with aplomb.Music of this movie, was a huge factor in it's success. It introduced a new singer Nazia-Hassan (a brit-pakistani) to hindi filmdom and she was an overnight star. The music director 'Kalyanji Anandji' got a new lease of life and it was also a stepping stone for 'Viju Shah' (I think he's the son of Kalyanji) to jump into the big league albeit temporarily.Overall, a good entertainer, that was a big hit. I'd give it a 7.0/10.0.</p>
