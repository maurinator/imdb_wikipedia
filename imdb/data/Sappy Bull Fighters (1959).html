<h1>Sappy Bull Fighters (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stranded in Mexico, the stooges need a job and a pretty actress friend gets them an engagement at the Plaza de Toros. When they accidentally switch suitcases with that of their friend, they must sneak into her house to retrieve their own and are confronted by her jealous husband who vows to kill them if he sees them again. At the arena where they perform a comedy bullfight (Joe is the matador, Moe and Larry are in a bull costume) the husband bribes the attendants to let a real bull into the ring. Joe knocks the bull out with a head butt and becomes a hero.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a remake of "What's the Matador" with Curly  Howard as third Stooge- and Let's be honest, it's  not near as good, mainly because Besser was not  Stooge material. But compared to other Besser Stooge  shorts, It's great. Greta Thyssen is great eye candy  for the male audience members. Gowan.... take the  bull by the horns and see this film for yourself. It  is funny. Highlights include the Stooges' harmonic  crying, Greta's husband discovering Larry under the  bed and some jokes that were recycled from "What's  the Matador" and the Shemp Stooge short "Don't throw  That Knife." For a Besser short, this is a must see.</p>
