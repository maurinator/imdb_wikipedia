<h1>Elmer Gantry (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Elmer Gantry is a fast talking, hard drinking traveling salesman who always has a risqu√© story and a hip flask to entertain cronies and customers alike. He is immediately taken with Sister Sharon Falconer, a lay preacher whose hellfire and damnation revivalism has attracted quite a following. Gantry uses his own quick wit and knowledge of the bible to become an indispensable part of Sister Sharon's roadshow but soon finds that his past catches up with him in the form of Lulu Bains, now a prostitute. While Gantry seeks and eventually gets forgiveness from Sharon, tragedy strikes when she finally manages to get out of her revivalist tent and opens a permanent church.</p>
<p>It's the mid 1920s. Elmer Gantry is a hard living, smooth talking traveling salesman who often uses Christian references in his sales pitches to his largely Christian clients. Along his travels, he comes across the traveling revival show of evangelist, Sister Sharon Falconer. He is immediately attracted to her and also sees her revival meetings as a way to make money. Using his sales techniques, especially on one of Sister Sharon's underlings, the naive Sister Rachel, Elmer is able to infiltrate his way into her entourage. He becomes the symbiotic antithesis to Sister Sharon: while he tells of heading toward the depths of hell for his many sins, Sister Sharon tells of being saved from that fate if repentance is forthcoming. Elmer's presence is against the wishes of Sister Sharon's manager, William Morgan, who sees through Elmer's smooth talking veneer, although William can't argue with the bottom line that Elmer brings to the meetings. Traveling along with the show is Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, Jim Lefferts, who looks at the show and Elmer with a critical eye, despite Sister Sharon, William and Elmer welcoming him as much as they can. William's business plan thus far has been for the show to set up in small towns. So it is against his wishes that Sister Sharon, who is falling for Elmer, agrees to Elmer's plan of setting up in the larger city of Zenith, where William feels the scrutiny of the cynical urban populace will hurt their brand. But it is Elmer's past, which catches up with him in Zenith, that may be his and by association Sister Sharon's downfall.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From the exceptionally talented pen of noted author Sinclair Lewis comes this entertaining story of a fast-talking, yarn-spinning vacuum salesman with the natural gift of persuasion. In his ever lustful sights is a voluptuous female preacher. In order to conquer her, he must use his extensive repertoire of biblical quips, quotes and bawdy antidotes. Within the sphere of a traveling troupe of bible beating, evangelicals on a religious crusade, the author's hero, one Elmer Gantry (supurbly played by Oscar wining Burt Lancaster) is as energetic as his tales. Although it's difficult to know if Gantry's spiritual motivation is genuine or merely a ploy, throughout the film, one is kept guessing. The target of his earthly desires is Beautiful Sister Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons) a sincere, but fallible woman out to build a ministry. A serious obstacle to her goal is Gantry, but more so is the cautionary and caustic pen of Jim Lefferts (Arthur Kennedy), a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who questions the personal and financial motives of her entourage. Her main supporter is worldly William Morgan (Dean Jagger) who believes in Falconer, and sees Gantry and Lefferts for the opportunistic impediments they are. The film is a triumph for Lancaster and Kennedy and for all those who wish to visit a confusing period of Americanna, when the word of God was infected by preachers, pushers and spiritual leeches. ****</p>
