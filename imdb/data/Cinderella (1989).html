<h1>Cinderella (1989)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>''Cinderella'' has been adapted for the screen countless times, but films based on''Aschenputtel''the Grimm version of the tale, are rare. This one was made for German Television in 1989, and it's a faithful translation.The Grimm Brothers were known for their ''darker'' versions of familiar tales.''Aschenputtel'' is no exception. And, because of this it may not be suitable for all audiences. Though the Grimm ending, in which the Stepsister's eyes are plucked out by Cinderella's Doves, has not been included, the Stepsister's mutilation of their feet, (in a vain attempt to fit the shoe) is. The Grimm's also added a Spiritual quality to this retelling. There is no Fairy Godmother. It's the Guiding Spirit of her dead mother (through a magical tree) who watches over her and helps her attain her ''Happy Ending''. Not surprisingly, the focus here is on the abuse the Heroine suffers at the hands of her Stepmother and Stepsisters, making her eventual deliverance that much more satisfying. The German cast will be unfamiliar to most US viewers, but they are all excellent.Young Petra Vigna makes a sensitive, appealing Cinderella who will inspire viewer sympathy. The standout performance,however, comes from Krista Stadler, a veteran of European film and Television, who plays the wicked stepmother. She is deliciously nasty(and very beautiful) in the part-though she adds a touch of humor as well. Sets and costumes, while strangely recalling the 19th century rather than a mystical ''Once Upon A Time'' era, are still very attractive. .As for the photography, it's so good that it's really a shame the film was not made for movie theaters. The English-dubbed version which was newly titled ''Cinderella''for Stateside release,is a bit out of sync,(par for the course for Americanized foreign product), but the voices are first-rate. Sadly, the musical score is not. Often, when foreign films were dubbed for the US market, new background scores were composed for them. And,surprisingly,it wasn't unusual when the new music actually improved the film itself.It's a shame that didn't happen this time. Other than this drawback,the movie is very well done, and will especially appeal to lovers of the story. They won't be disappointed.</p>
