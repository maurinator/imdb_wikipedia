<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A village and the crazy situations encountered by its citizens.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is probably one of the most interesting examples on surrealist comedy in the modern spanish history. It's a critic, acid portrait of what has been Spain under the dictatorship of General Franco, and specially critic with how is Spain actually - which is the same as before, but with other names. Being surrealist (or even totally unreal) it's hard to follow all the metaphors, analogies, hyperboles present in this movie, and besides the language barrier, it will be very hard to understand by non-spanish viewers in this context of being just a critic. Still, many of the critics can be applied to any of the "modern, free" societies all around.But besides the "serious" part, this is also one of the best comedies, and most underrated, obscure and hardly known spanish movies. Its very special and unique sense of humor can only make you laugh again and again even about the saddest things. Continuous changes of points of view, jokes, absurd situations, killing topics and killer topics too. One of the most funny movies certainly, and worth it for a mindless laugh or for a insightful, deep view of the spanish society, or any other society for what it seems. If you have the opportunity, please watch it.</p>
