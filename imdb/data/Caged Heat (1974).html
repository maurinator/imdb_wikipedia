After a while the prisoners put away their petty differences and plan the Big Prison Escape.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not quite sure what to think of Caged Heat. Don't get me wrong I think Demme is a magnificent director but thisÂ…Ugh, I'm not sure what to say. I read that Caged Heat was praised by critics, I could probably see what they saw in comparison to other girls in prison flicks. It didn't have that aspect of a campy movie. It had some style to it which is good. It shows that Demme had some sense of artistic view from the very beginning of his career.  You can tell that he took time in planing out shots. The best example of this is when the camera is passing by the prison cells and you can see each inmate doing something different. Those are also signs of good directing. The characters are memorable and well developed. The movie doesn't aim for showing a lot of skin.  Sure some of the girls are very attractive (especially the two blond ones), still the movie doesn't rely on sex at all.I guess you can say this is a decent first attempt.  Considering the budget he had to work with, I'd say its pretty good. Its good to see directors work their way up but never forget where they came from. Demme was grateful to be working with Roger Corman and it shows. He gave him a role in Silence of the Lambs. Nevertheless Caged Heat is nice to check out. It's great entertainment that's for sure. And isn't that what films are all about?</p>
