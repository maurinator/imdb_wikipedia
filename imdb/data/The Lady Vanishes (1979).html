<h1>The Lady Vanishes (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a train traveling through pre-WW II Germany, American heiress Amanda Kelly befriends a Miss Froy, an older nanny. But when Miss Froy disappears, everyone Amanda asks denies ever having seen her. Eventually Amanda persuades American photographer Robert Condon to help her search the train, during which they discover that Miss Froy wasn't quite what she seemed.</p>
<p>Whilst traveling in pre-war Nazi Germany, a young couple realise a passenger seems to have been kidnapped off their train, but, no other passenger aside from themselves, recalls her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ugh! What a mess! Only Angela Lansbury among the major cast members stands out. Cybill Shepherd seems to have the "madcap" part down, but too often she is merely silly rather than funny. As for Elliott Gould, he seems completely miscast, and acts as if he wandered in from another movie. This is hardly an improvement of -- or even an enlightening insight into -- the Hitchcock original. Only intermittently entertaining, but, by all means, see it if you're a Lansbury fan : she's wonderful!</p>
