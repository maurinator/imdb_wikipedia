<h1>Suddenly (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The tranquility of a small town is marred only by sheriff Tod Shaw's unsuccessful courtship of widow Ellen Benson, a pacifist who can't abide guns and those who use them. But violence descends on Ellen's household willy-nilly when the U.S. President passes through town... and slightly psycho hired assassin John Baron finds the Benson home ideal for an ambush.</p>
<p>The President of the United States will be arriving by train in the town of Suddenly where he plans to then be driven to a nearby lodge. The Sheriff, Tod Shaw, has everything under control and with the assistance of the State Police, has set up a reasonable security plan. Soon however, Shaw is taken prisoner by John Baron in the home of Pop Benson. Baron and his henchmen gained access to Benson's home by posing as FBI agents. The house provides perfect line of sight to the train station and Baron is there for only one reason: to assassinate the President. Baron has no political agenda and is simply a killer for hire but it's left to the Sheriff, Benson and Benson's daughter-in-law Ellen to stop him.</p>
<p>In the city of Suddenly, three gangsters trap the Benson family in their own house, on the top of a hill nearby the railroad station, with the intention of killing the president of the USA.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I started to watch this movie I didn't think it was going to be any good. How wrong! I've seen lots of Frank Sinatra movies and I never liked any of them, because I think he is a terrible actor in all those movies (and that goes for films like "From Here to Eternity" and "Some Came Running", which the critics always claim to be "wonderful - come on!). BUT in this one he is GREAT, just GREAT - his best performance, perfect. The movie is quite good as well. Simple, but good. And those close-ups on Sinatra's face are always right were they should be to create the dramatic effect perfect for the situation. Watch it! It's good, and doesn't bore you because it doesn't go on and on and on like most films nowadays about somebody wanting to kill the president of the USA.</p>
