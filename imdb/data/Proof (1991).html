<h1>Proof (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Black comedy about a blind man, Martin, who takes photographs as "proof" that the world really is as others describe it to him. The film explores his antagonistic relationships with Celia, who cleans and cooks for him and habitually rearranges the furniture in the house, and with Andy, a mate he thinks he can trust.</p>
<p>Anonymous states that Celia, in addition to other duties, "habitually rearranges the furniture in the house." What she really does is place furniture in Martin's way so that he may trip. This also shows how she can be cruel to him when he does not do what she wants.</p>
<p>The life of a blind photographer who is looked after by a housekeeper is disrupted by the arrival of an agreeable restaurant worker.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having noticed a film crew shooting in the gardens at the end of my street, I eventually realized the film was "Proof". I thought I better check it out, and was pleasantly surprised with the result.I knew little about either Hugo Weaving or Russell Crowe at the time and thought they were both very good in it, especially Weaving. Like most Australian movies it was filmed on a low budget, and on this occasion produced very good results.If you enjoyed this for reasons other than the "Crowe Factor", you should try some other Aussie films.Eg. Malcolm (It's An Unreal Movie)</p>
