<h1>Wild Iris (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A weary young woman, Iris Brevard, is forced to move in with her overbearing mother, Min, following her husband's suicide. She finds her only escape from her mother's badgering is to verbally fight back and to hide herself in an alcoholic haze. Unfortunately, her young teen son, Lonnie, observes all of this and finds himself torn between the two women. The older woman is multi-dimensional as she is clearly shown as manipulative and critical, but also as loving and charming. This is clearly shown in scenes with Fred Ward as the father of a bride-to-be who comes to the women's bridal gown shop to stop the purchase of his daughter's wedding dress. After facing Rowlands, he willingly writes the check for the next dress payment. The film also raises questions about whether Min was responsible for the suicide of Iris' husband. As Lonnie questions his father's death and is faced with similar pressures, he also clearly is considering his life options.</p>
<p>A depressed woman battles with her mother and abuses alcohol following the suicide of her husband.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Laura Linney and Gena Rowlands provide a well told tale of mother/daughter dynamics, and the failure of family. I have to admit Laura Linney is a surprise; she has always been believable, but this role is a bit different, and it works.Gena Rowlands is the manipulative grandmother, who owns a bridal shoppe, and knows everyone in town. There is a very amusing scene where she manipulates a scruffy neighbor (Fred Ward) into shelling out a great deal of money for his pregnant daughter's wedding.The score is very beautiful, reflecting loss (Linney is a widow) and hope for the future. Linney's son, Lonnie, misses his deceased father, and attempts to reach out to his grandmother. Linney finds herself trying to find a job in a new world (she has not worked in quite some time) She clearly loves her son, but has bought into her mother's negative comments.This film is noteworthy because it is sensitive and realistic, while not overly negative. How does a widow survive her husband's suicide, her mother's controlling psychosis, her son's depression, and her own alcoholism?. A very timely movie worth watching. 10/10</p>
