<h1>Bonjour Tristesse (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cecile, decadent young girl who lives with her rich playboy father Raymond. When Anne, Raymond's old love interest, comes to Raymond's villa, Cecile is afraid for her way of life.</p>
<p>In the French Riviera, the spoiled and futile seventeen years old girl Cecile is spending the summer vacation with her father, the widow playboy and bon-vivant Raymond, and his girlfriend Elsa. Cecile has a serious Complex of Oedipus with her father, and they have a quite incestuous relationship. The successful designer and former friend of her mother Anne Larson arrives in their seaside house invited by Raymond to spend a couple of days with them, and the life of Cecile changes when Raymond proposes Anne to marry him. Full of jealousy, Cecile plots with Elsa to separate Anne from Raymond.</p>
<p>Parisians Raymond, a widowed man, and his seventeen year old daughter Cecile, who calls her father by his given name, live a life of privilege, decadence and frivolity. Their play is with each other, with whomever else they fancy and who want to be part of that decadent lifestyle. They are currently on vacation on the French Riviera with Raymond's latest conquest, Elsa, who is as much a casual lover for Raymond as she is a playmate for Cecile's partying ways. Their life changes when they receive a visit from Anne, Cecile's mother's best friend. Raymond falls in love with Anne and they decide to get married. Cecile is initially happy for Raymond, as she sees Anne as being a stabilizing force in his life. But Cecile comes to the realization that that stabilizing force also applies to her and will change the decadent life to which she's become accustomed. With the help of Elsa and Philippe, Cecile's latest beau of whom Anne does not approve, Cecile does whatever she needs to to protect her way of life. Cecile does not foresee how this plan will ultimately affect her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'll never forget seeing a pristine print of this magnificently shot (entirely on location in the French Riviera) Preminger classic on the huge screen of the Egyptian theater in Hollywood (I refuse to watch the cut-up video version currently available), and let me tell you, there is no more poetic or romantic film in existence. Forget the silly, soap-opera pretext of a Francoise Sagan plot, just sit back and let the 'real' story, the visual poetry drift over you and take you away. Now, I'm not saying this because I'm in love with both Jean Seberg and Deborah Kerr (how can you not be, the way they look on the screen here), but because this is the quintessential Otto Preminger film, where he takes the trashiest of romance novels and proceeds to make a case study demonstration of how irrelevant 'standard' plot devices can be in the cinema by making a visual masterpiece out of it.</p>
