<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film had a beautiful beginning and ending to it. The storyline had an intriguing plot to it: A girl called So-Eun in 1979 gets a radio and a guy called In Ji from 20 years later contacts her. They get to know each other by talking on the radio and arrange to meet at the clock tower, which they find to be impossible. The film has some beautiful scenery in the beginning and end as well. So-Eun's hospitalized friend was cute and funny and they were friends until So-Eun found out what lay ahead. The story itself was cute, sad, and humorous, mostly sad and beautiful I'd say. Sad because of what So-Eun finds out, and what goes on between the future guy and the girl of the past, but beautiful.</p>
