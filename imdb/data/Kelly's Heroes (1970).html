<h1>Kelly's Heroes (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During World War II a German Colonel is captured by the Americans but before he can be interrogated an artillery barrage hits the camp. However, Ex-Lieutenant Kelly manages to reach the Colonel, get him drunk and learn that he is on a secret mission to ship $16,000,000 of gold to a base in France. Kelly is determined to get the gold and plans for himself and a few of his fellow soldiers to slip into enemy territory and steal the bullion.</p>
<p>During World War II, Lieutenant Kelly learns of a German bank located behind enemy lines containing 16 million dollars in gold bars. His platoon, led by Big Joe, has three days of R&R; coming, so, with the aid of hustler Crapgame, anachronistic hippie Oddball, three Sherman tanks and a touch of irreverence, Kelly leads his men deep into French territory to steal the gold for themselves.</p>
<p>A group of U.S. soldiers sneaks across enemy lines to get their hands on a secret stash of Nazi treasure.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Interesting enough, reading through the comments on this film, I noted only one detractor, some sorehead from Canada who completely missed the point of the film.  No, Sr. Canadiense.  This is not a serious film about WW2.  Read some of the excellent commentaries here about the social and temporal context of this film, i.e., the height of the Vietnamese war.  Yes, Sutherland, your fellow countryman, was an active anti-war protester and fully embraced the anachronistic hippie role.  The mad-cap story which tweaks the nose of the "establishment," in this case, the military establishment, is plausible when you let go of the blood, guts and glory of the war film genre. And, it is a damn funny film.  Eastwood is at his clenched jaw, cynical best; Savalas is great as the Sergeant big-guy; Carrol O'Conner is riotious as the general; Rickles is, well, Rickles.  But, Sutherland steals the show.  The scenes where they tanks come out blasting the Germans to the tune of twangy Country-Western music is hilarious.  Sutherland's out-of-time-sync "...no negative vibes... hey, man...yeah, baby..." is side-splitting.  The final confrontation scene between the three striding up to the German tank commander, with Sutherland loosening his side arm, ala Clint Eastwood in Fist full of Dollars is a riot.   This film is full of funny stuff.  And, you can see it again and again and find new business to laugh about.  Buffs will delight at seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a pre-Repo Man role and Richard Davalos who played James Dean's doomed brother Aron in East of Eden.  This is a great piece of satire that was overlooked, cast aside and has still survived to the delight of those of us who enjoy it again and again.  But, hey, don't just take my word for it.  Of the 30 or so commentaries here-- and do read them, as there are some excellent ones-- only one was a detractor.</p>
