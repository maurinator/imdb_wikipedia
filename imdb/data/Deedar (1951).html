<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rendered blind as a child Shamu can only remember the girl who was his childhood companion. As an adult when he sees her, thanks to the doctor(played by Ashok Kumar)he is overwhelmed. But Mala(Nargis) quite naturally has no recollection of him. She is now waiting to marry Ashok Kumar, who is ready to sacrifice his love for Dilip. The emotions are brilliantly portraid by all three. The film remains memorable for Dilip's performance as a blind man. The movie was mentioned in Vikram Seth's Suitable Boy.</p>
