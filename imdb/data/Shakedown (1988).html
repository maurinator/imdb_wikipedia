<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Since its theatrical release, "Shakedown" has all but been forgotten by the public. Having just watched it again after more than twenty five years since I first saw it, I think I know why it has faded into obscurity. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible movie. For starters, it looks great, with expert cinematography and lighting despite being made with a somewhat conservative budget. And director James Glickenhaus, like in his other movies, definitely shows he can direct action - the action scenes in this movie are very well done. But a closer look at the movie soon reveals some big flaws. While Sam Elliot shows his trademark weary charm and makes his character appealing, his co-star Peter Weller doesn't fare so well. Weller is kind of stiff, maybe because his character is eventually made to be not so likable despite being in a lead protagonist position. The screenplay (also by Glickenhaus) is also kind of a mess, with important characters disappearing for long periods of time, as well as the central story moving extremely slowly (or not at all) for equally long periods of time.Is the movie worth seeing? In some circumstances, yes. If you actively seek it out and/or pay good money to see it, chances are you'll be disappointed. But if it crosses your path during a slow day for free, you'll probably find it helps pass the time in an acceptable manner.</p>
