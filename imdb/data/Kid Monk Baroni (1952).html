<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I bought this one dollar DVD that has 4 vintage mobster movies on it from echo bridge(platinum video)the big combo,port of new york,johnny one eye and the best one on the DVD kid monk baroni,first of all i never knew Leonard Nimoy made a movie this early,i just remember his small part in the brain eaters in 1958,but this is a pretty well made movie about an Italian street thug(Nimoy)who turns to boxing with the guidance of a priest.its sort of like a Bowery boys movie but without the laughs.as baronis sidekick friend Angelo is Jack Larson(jimmy Olsen on the TV superman series)i enjoyed this nostalgic fifties movie and unusual seeing Leonard Nimoy playing an Italian street thug in new york, as Spock would say logical.this one is from Jack Broder productions (bela Lugosi meets a brooking gorilla,bride of the gorilla)a good movie.</p>
