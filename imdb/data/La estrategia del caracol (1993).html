<h1>La estrategia del caracol (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie really is a masterpiece of Colombian cinema. Telling this simple story it involves the viewer in the life of the people renting rooms in this house for more than 20 years (which by law makes them owners) and how they all work together to get out of the situation when they have to evacuate it.In a very dramatic and quite depressed background the director is able to tell a story that makes laugh and that, with an unexpected ending, brings the best conclusion I have ever seen. It shows the positivism of Colombian people and how even in the worst situation, there is always a way out.Totally recommended!</p>
