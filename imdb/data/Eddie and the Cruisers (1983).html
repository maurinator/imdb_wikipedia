<h1>Eddie and the Cruisers (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>They say rock 'n' roll never dies, but one dark night in 1963, Eddie Wilson's car took a dive off a New Jersey bridge with the troubled rock idol at the wheel. His body was never found. Twenty years after the lead singer of Eddie and the Cruisers disappeared, the band's songs are hotter than ever. And renewed interest in the band leads television reporter Maggie Foley to pursue a tantalizing mystery: What if Eddie is still alive? The circumstances surrounding his death are just shadowy enough to make it a distinct possibility, and someone (could it be Eddie?) has been ransacking the homes of the surviving band members in a desperate search for tapes of the group's visionary, never-released album. As Maggie interviews the former band members, the pieces of the puzzle start to fit... but only until still deeper mysteries begin to surface.</p>
<p>A television newswoman picks up the story of a 1960s rock band whose long-lost leader - Eddie Wilson - may still be alive, while searching for the missing tapes of the band's never-released album.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is probably my all-time favorite movie.  I can't explain why in terms to satisfy most people though.  It's just one of those things.  I love the music and have been to see John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band many times since the release of this movie.  The idea that a prominent celebrity could vanish from society is a thrilling storyline for this movie.  Its movies like these that help people whose loved ones are missing to keep the faith.  It also breeds fantasy that stars like Elvis and Jim Morrison are still alive.  I could write more but I'd rather go watch this movie!!!</p>
