<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched it and kind of liked it. But after 4 years I ran into it in some channel, to discover that I forgot it wholly. And I'm not that someone who forgets movies he watched. So why that happened ? It's surely related to everything this movie made, and me. Actually "me" just hated the mean personality of this movie sometimes with all the free sarcasm of the fat women, the neurologically-sick people (the old employee of the company with the trembling nick), and the retarded people as well (this is the ugliest bottom this movie hits). Even the rest of the 2 lead's stuff wasn't funny either. There was a complete nut job evil guy, too exaggerated action scenes (where Damon Wayans transforms into Batman!), let alone some things bothered my stomach to the max such as (Marlon Wayans) and (Almayvonne). So, what's here to be loved ? It's easy : Vanity's poster on the wall of (Damon Wayans)'s apartment. (Stacy Dash)'s sexy charisma. Hmmm.. What else ?! Somehow the plot. And (Damon Wayans)'s performance. Generally (Mo' Money) isn't a bad movie. It's just offensive at some places, unfunny at many, and have-not when it comes to any excellent factor. Still the good parts make it something to watch. But not to laugh with!</p>
