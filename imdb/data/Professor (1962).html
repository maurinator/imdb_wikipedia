<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Professor belongs to that era of Hindi cinema when Shammi Kapoor could do no wrong. He lip-synced great Rafi numbers, romanced Asha/Sadhana/Saira/Sharmila/Rajshree in picturesque Kashmir/Ooty/Darjeeling and at times Swiss locations and beat up Pran/Jeevan/Prem Chopra/Prem nath. This fluffy musical romance is no different than the others. He plays Preetam, a man forced to pose as a Professor twice his age due to job constraints. Giving him ample support in the eye-candy department is Kalpana. She looks good but at times gets onto your nerves because of her saccharine sweet voice. Lalita Pawar is great as the strict aunt in charge of Kalpana and her siblings. And the rest of the cast is adequate.The things that stand out are the award winning music which included gems like "Aye Gulbadan", "Main chali main chali","Awaaz deke humne tum","Khuli palak mein jhoota gussa" and many more delights. Shammi Kapoor, nominated for an award for his performance, is charming and restrained.Watch it for the songs and Shammi's performance.</p>
