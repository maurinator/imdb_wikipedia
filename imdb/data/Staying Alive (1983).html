<h1>Staying Alive (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this sequel to Saturday Night Fever, former disco king Tony Manero has left Brooklyn and lives in Manhattan. He stays in a cheap hotel and works as a dance instructor and as a waiter at a dance club, trying to succeed as a professional dancer on Broadway. The breakaway from his Brooklyn life, family and friends seems to have matured Tony and refined his personality, represented by his diminished accent and his avoidance of alcohol and profanity. However, certain attitudes have not changed, as with his most recent girlfriend, who's also the singer of a local rock band.</p>
<p>It's five years later and Tony Manero's Saturday Night Fever is still burning. Now he's strutting toward his biggest challenge yet - succeeding as a dancer on the Broadway stage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What, no user comments for Staying Alive?  Well then I guess I better add one.  :)  This movie is entertaining, but I must tell you, I always thought this film was considered a BIG flop until I checked business information here.  Hell, it made almost 70 million - that doesn't sound like too much of a flop to me.Staying Alive is a pretty good film, though not even close to the MONSTER that Saturday Night Fever was years earlier.  It has a nice soundtrack (again, how can it compare to the one from the first film - TWENTY MILLION albums sold is no easy feat to match) and manages to make us still love Tony Manero no matter how big of a dork he is at times.Yeah, the film is unbelievable and silly as hell at times, but it's still a good hour and half of fun to check out when you have time.  How many people remember this film was directed by Sylvester Stallone?  Not many.  Look for his cameo performance (he bumps into Travolta on the street while passing by) as well as hearing someone yell "Yo Adrian! Showtime" while the dancers are preparing for their show toward the end of the film.  Corny stuff, but fun, and Tony can still strut.  Enjoy!</p>
