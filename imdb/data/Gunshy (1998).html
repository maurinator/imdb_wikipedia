<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Everything about this movie is unconvincing, from the acting and dialogue to the action, direction and camera work. The characters are stereotyped and shallow and the story flimsy. The action goes from one predictable event to another without relief from start to finish. The actors are all competent in other films but in this sorry movie their talents are not utilized and dormant. The camera work is only one baby step above home movies and bores to tears.The action is illogical and unmotivated. For example, when Jake, played by William Peterson of CSI fame finds his woman in bed with another man, he barely bats an eye but nonetheless decides to drink himself to death. Scenes occasionally move one to another without rhyme or reason. Time moves unnaturally as one moment someone is unclothed and in the next dressed and in the wrong position based on movement of time.This movie wasn't worth he effort needed to wait through the credits.</p>
