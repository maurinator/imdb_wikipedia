<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this series, aeroplanes are my thing. Does anyone know if its available on DVD / Video. I would pay a good asking price for it I saw the original being made at Old Warden here in England and loved the play acting. Likewise, I thought it ended bit suddenly and I would liked to have seen the conclusion.I have got the books and they are pretty much like the TV show. I don't believe its ever been repeated here in UK, unless of course its been on SKY, never seen it though. The aeroplanes were all models built an dflown near my home town, realistic looking they were too. The factual part of the show was good, as were the uniforms.cheers</p>
