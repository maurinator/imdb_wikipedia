<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nicklas lives a pretty normal teenage life, until one day, not far from graduation, when a gangster from his school beats him up. Nicklas passes out, and the next day when he returns to school he notices that nobody seems to notice him. As he tries to get attention he notices that his actions disappear the moment he has done them. He throws a book and as soon as it lands it's back where he picked it up. He has returned as a ghost, but he can do nothing but passively observe as the police stand clueless to the murder.</p>
<p>After an attack leaves him in limbo, invisible to the living and also near death. A teenager discovers the only person who might be able to help him, is his attacker.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The girl acting as a villain in this film is incredible. Her performance is powerful in it!! From the beginning of the movie, she is hated by everyone. I hated her, too as I saw her in this film. Toward the end of it, I Couldn't help but crying for her. The cruel surface of the girl covered the sweetest emotion trapped inside. She is lovely at the end!!!! How powerful her performance is!! The actress is Tuva Novotny. I will remember her name and expect her upcoming films in the future. By the way, the leading actor is really great, too. Gustaf Skarsg√•rd is also excellent in Ondskan (evil). Certainly he is one of the most talented Swedish actor nowaday. Anyway Osynlige, Den is really a great movie. Watch this original one and skip the remake.</p>
