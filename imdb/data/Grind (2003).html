<h1>Grind (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While the rest of his high school graduating class is heading to the same old grind of college, skateboarder Eric Rivers and his best friends, Dustin, a goal-oriented workaholic, and misfit slacker Matt have one last summer roadtrip together to follow their dream of getting noticed by the professional skateboarding world--and getting paid to skate. When skating legend Jimmy Wilson's skate demo tour hits town, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned skate team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Jimmy's road manager and they can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. But they do get some free advice: keep skating, stay true to yourself, and stay in the game--if you're good, you'll get noticed. Following their dream-- and Jimmy's national tour--Eric, Dustin and Matt start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund. After recruiting laid-back ladies man Sweet Lou to join their crew and provide the wheels for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chi-town to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody skaters, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acu√±a, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Four skaters follow their idol on his summer tour in an attempt to get noticed, get sponsored, and become stars themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think Grind is a great movie with a lot of comedy and good skating footage. This one will only appeal to you if you like skateboarding, so I can understand the mixed reviews. the humour in this film is meant for a younger audience. What did you expect before watching though? You must have gone into this movie knowing it was about skateboarding. I don't think a guy who is 40 and knows nothing about skating will appreciate it at all. With that being said, Grind has some pretty good skating scenes that you will enjoy watching. Bam Margara has a small role in the film also. I thought the entire movie was pretty hilarious but the story is unlikely to happen. Don't take Grind too seriously because it's a little far fetched. In real life this would never happen, but thats the beauty of these kind of movies.</p>
