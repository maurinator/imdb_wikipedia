<h1>Agatha (2008)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An actress famous for her performances in Agatha Christie plays loses her mind and disappears shortly before she is to open on Broadway in a revival of The Mousetrap. Meanwhile, at a struggling community theater in Bedlam, Connecticut, a woman walks in on a rehearsal of The Unexpected Guest. The female lead has just quit the cast, mere days before opening night; but luckily, this stranger knows the lines and agrees to take the role. What seems like a stroke of luck unravels on Opening Night, as the murder mystery morphs into an Actor's Nightmare.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen the whole film--it's a really funny comedy plotted like a disaster movie. No cheap laugh gimmicks, just genuine humor of character and situation. I've been in my share of shoestring community-theater productions and have had some similar experiences, trying to hold a scene together for an audience when everything is going wrong. But what I like best about this film is that although making fun of community theater is easy, making comedy of community theater is harder--because it requires real understanding of, and respect or even affection for, the hard work and sincerity that go into a community theater production. And this film has that. It also shows respect for the warhorse Agatha Christie plays that community theaters put on again and again while at the same time demonstrating how easily they can become hilarious instead of mysterious.</p>
