<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Man's inhumanity to man is presented here with no artifice.  This has long been a favorite of mine, although it's difficult to sell many others on the premise -- an honest, benevolent Governor in medieval Japan is imprisoned by the military regime, forcing his wife, son, and daughter to fend for themselves.  They are soon captured, separated, and sold into slavery, but remained determined to reunite.There's something about the medieval Japanese setting that lends itself to explorations of grandiose themes painted with a broad brush.  This will break your heart, and belongs on your shelf next to "Ran".</p>
