<h1>Gardish (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shiva is being groomed to become a policeman just like his father Purshottam Sathe. When his father refuses to let the son of a local MLA illegally park his car, Purshottam is transferred to the dangerous basti of Kala Chowk. When his father is beaten by henchmen of the local crimelord, Shiva steps in to help. However his defeating of the crimelord and his men has an untoward result. Shiva is hailed as the new crimelord and criminals start collecting protection money in his name.</p>
<p>Naive and easily impressionable Vidya Bhalla would like her husband to be a dashing hero, one who is not afraid of anybody, one who can easily jump into a fire to rescue someone, one who is strong & romantic. She sees all of these qualities in Shiva Sathe, the son of Havaldar Purshotam Sathe, whose only dream is to see Shiva become a Police Inspector. Vidya informs her dad, Prithviraj, that she has found her dream man, the Bhallas and the Sathes meet and get the couple formally engaged. Then Purshotam arrests the son of a M.L.A., and as a result he is transferred to the notorious Kala Chowki Police Station in Bombay. Upon arrival he finds out that the Inspector in charge of the Police Station, Saini, has been severely beaten-up by Billa Jilani and is hospitalized. Purshotam arranges for his entire family to re-locate. Shortly thereafter Shiva's brother-in-law approached Prithviraj Bhalla and informs him that Shiva has become an underworld Don, he has severely beaten-up the existing don, Billa Jilani, and is busy taking haftas and bribes from everyone. Prithviraj decides to investigate, and he does find that Shiva has become a ruffian, known to the police, arrested a number of times, much to the chagrin of his dad. Prithviraj breaks off the alliance and accordingly informs Purshotam. Shortly thereafter another fight breaks out, this time Shiva is arrested, held in a cell for several days, then beaten up by his father and subsequently bailed out by a woman named Shanti - a prostitute. Watch as events unfold and how Shiva came to be involved with a prostitute, and how Purshotam's dreams have now become nightmares where he sees his son handcuffed, and in shackles, waiting to be hanged.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of Priyadarshan's viciously underrated films...and in my opinion, Gardish is one of the most well acted Indian films ever. The story is of an aspiring policeman (Jackie Shroff) who gets caught in a web of hooliganism and the fight of his father (mesmerisingly played by Amrish Puri) to keep his son from becoming corrupt. The story may sound tried and tested but the results on screen are nothing short of amazing. Excellent direction by Priyadrashan, where he more than capably manages to portray the emotions of both father and son. The film never bores or loses the audience's attention because the screenplay is so flowing and relevant. I think Amrish Puri deserved a National Award for his performance and this is one of Jackie Shroff's most praiseworthy performances. The star of the show though, once again, is Amrish Puri (surely the most underrated actor to work in Bollywood). His performance rivals that of Amitabh Bachchan's in some of his classics such as Sholay and Silsila. If you like to be entertained by watching well acted, well directed and stimulating films, then you must watch this!</p>
