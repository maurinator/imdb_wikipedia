<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Goody-goody girl journalist Kelly Olsson (Ann-Margret Olsson) poses as a "swinger" to impress the horny stud editor of "Girl-lure" men's magazine (Tony Franciosa) to get him to publish her steaming sex story instead of her posing as his next nude centerfold.

<p>An authoress writes a steaming sex-novel and proceeds to live out her heroine's adventures.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>60s sex kitten Ann-Margret teams up with legendary director George Sidney to craft the perfect 60s movie.  The story of a good girl posing as a bad girl to get a bad boy who's secretly a good boy is perfectly executed.  Forget the plot - bottom line, A-M sings, dances and seduces the heck out of perfect foil, Tony Franciosa.  Watch for vintage 60s photo montages, Hollywood's version of hippies and beatniks, a Pygmalion rip-off, wholesome dancing kids sharing a house with a vice squad cop (Sgt. Hooker no less), chase scenes, snotty British characters, the ubiquitous climax at a befuddled police sergeant's desk, Andre Previn original music, A-M as a stripper and riding a motorcycle plus an hilarious staged orgy in which the star is covered in paint and offered up to a Neptune-like god.  Now that's entertainment!  Also note: whenever Ann-Margret breaks into dance in the film suddenly, out of nowhere, there's a fan blowing on her.  Well, watching this classic 60s sex comedy will make a fan out of anyone who likes 60s movies, musicals, romantic comedies and the always brilliant Miss Ann-Margret.  Swing away!!!</p>
