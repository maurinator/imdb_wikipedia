<p>Having escaped death by the guillotine, Dr. Frankenstein relocates to Carlsbruck. There, as Dr. Victor Stein, he successfully establishes himself as a physician with a large practice and a hospital for the poor. After three years however he is recognized by Dr. Hans Kleve but rather than expose him, the young doctor wants to join him in his research. Frankenstein has resumed his experiments and is on the verge of re-animating a body he has constructed using the brain of Fritz, the deformed assistant who helped him escape from his death sentence. The operation goes quite well and Fritz is quite pleased with his new body. An encounter with a drunken hospital attendant however sends him on the run. As his mind and his body deteriorates, he publicly reveals the good Doctor's true identity.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is sentenced to the guillotine but he succeeds to escape facilitated by the hunchback Karl Immelmann (Michael Gwynn) to Carlsbruck in Germany adopting the alias Doctor Victor Stein. Three years later, he is a successful physician in a poor hospital. Doctor Hans Kleve (Francis Matthews) recognizes Frankenstein and blackmails him to be his assistant. Dr. Stein shows a perfect body and tells to Dr. Kleve that Karl will donate his brain to a healthy body. They successfully transplant Karl's brain to the new body and Dr. Stein hides Karl in the attic. However a snoopy janitor (George Woodbridge) witnesses the transportation to the room and tells to the nurse Margaret Conrad (Eunice Gayson) that the doctors have hidden a patient in the attic. Meanwhile Dr. Kleve comments with Karl that he will become a medical sensation and Karl is afraid of the situation. When Margaret finds Karl in the attic, he convinces her to release the straps that hold him to the bed. Karl runs to Dr. Steins's laboratory but he is attacked by a man that believes that he is a burglar. When Dr. Stein and Dr. Kleve arrive in the laboratory, Karl has already gone leaving two deaths on his path. What will happen to Karl and to Dr. Frankenstein?"The Revenge of Frankenstein" is a good sequel of "Frankenstein" despite the title since there is no revenge. This is a good movie from Hammer and that is not a surprise having director Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing in the cast. Dr. Frankenstein giving explanations to Dr. Kleve about his transplantation procedure is very funny. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available</p>
