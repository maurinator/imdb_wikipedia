<h1>Fellini's Casanova (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Casanova is a libertine, collecting seductions and sexual feats. But he is really interested in someone, and is he really an interesting person ? Is he really alive ?</p>
<p>Based on the memoirs of Casanova, Fellini offers his version using rare visual daring and imagination. The film features a breathtaking performance from the sultry Sutherland as the original playboy in his latter days as he travels through Europe engaging in a variety of amorous adventures.</p>
<p>An episode tale which mostly takes place in 18th century Italy. Giacomo Casanova is a modestly wealthy adventurer who leads a futile existence; his only strengths lie in seduction and sexual performance. His life becomes increasingly meaningless as lovers slip away. The film is loosely based off of the biography by Giacomo Casanova himself, although, like all of Fellini's literary adaptations (post 8 1/2), the film is decorated with a wreathe of absurdity.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have but one question: Why in the name of all that we call the cosmos is this film not available on DVD (or even VHS)? It is far superior and reflects much more the times and life of Casanova than the Chamberlain film that trudged its way from start to finish. Casanova was an eighteenth-century intellectual, an intellectual with very definite proclivities for womanizing. Fellini knew his subject and the many places where his subject found himself in a lifetime of incredible sights, sounds and adventures. Get this film out of the closet, dust it off and let us have the very positive experience of enjoying it in the sanctity of our own homes. It has been too long on ice. Someone "out there", get off your duff and let us have one of Fellini's best works.</p>
