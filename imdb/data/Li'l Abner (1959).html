<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>as well as a knowledge of history to appreciate the political satire of this film.  But I believe all it takes is an understanding of human nature, which is immutable.  "Li'l Abner" does reflect the mores of its time, but so does everything.  To judge it against today's work is useless and immature.Al Capp was a satirist, and this movie is the best visual representation we have extant today of his genius.  His books are mostly out of print; a sad lack for us.  But this film contains timeless and true reflections of life. The one that tickles me most is "Put Them Back," when women wanted "perfect" men (buff, cut and all those other adjectives of current popularity) only to realize that people who are self-absorbed in their own perfection have nothing to provide to others.  Talk about a telling statement of today!The production design was perfect for its goal:  to recreate the cartoon-like atmosphere of Capp's strips.  The colors, costumes and sets draws one into the strip itself.I'm an unabashed fan of the American musical as an artform.  "Li'l Abner" fills all the slots of the musical in a superior achievement.  Is it dated? Of course it is - it's over 40 years old.  Is it obsolete?  Absolutely not, just as human nature in all its good and bad can never be obsolete.If you don't take the time to learn about the ebbs and swells of the human tide, you'll never understand what life is about.  Instead of being negative about a time and place you didn't experience, try learning about it. After all, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  (Can we say "weapons of mass destruction?"</p>
