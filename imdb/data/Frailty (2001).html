<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>People have different perceptions when they evaluate movies. I will only tell you what I felt when I saw this Close to Masterpiece Motion Picture.I must Highlist here, that I never wanted this movie to End. Never... I wanted it to be as long as my favorite movies were, Like Lord of the Rings - extended versions, Into the Wild, Dances with Wolves etc. But, it was not the case here.... Though the movie was short (with perspective to my wants) It still delivers what was needed from it in short span of time. But again this is what I believe. Anyways, I'll plot the outline like this....A widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, which is hard to believe and they are torn apart of whether believing it or not......... As the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destinies. So goes the story forward...I watched it twice and I must say it was something I would like to watch again and again.I really appreciate all the efforts of the Director put forward to make this Precious Art which doesn't come often. Really, it is hard to find such movies...Anyways, If You haven't seen this movie, I really recommend you to go and see it, I give it 9/10</p>
