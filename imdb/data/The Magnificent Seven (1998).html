<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When an Indian village is threatened by ex-Confederate soldiers, several villagers head out to seek help. They recruit seven men, each with unique skills, who return to the village and take on the raiders. Following this, the men take up residence in a small town, making their skills available to those in need.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Magnificent Seven is one of the best series already shown in the TV. In spite of a minority not to like of the show, happily for us a minority, the Internet is full of sites about the series, proving that itÂ´s really an excellent show. With great actors and great histories. I hope that this show returns some day.</p>
