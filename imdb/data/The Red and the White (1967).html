<h1>The Red and the White (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1919, Hungarian Communists aid the Bolsheviks' defeat of Czarists, the Whites. Near the Volga, a monastery and a field hospital are held by one side then the other. Captives are executed or sent running naked into the woods. Neither side has a plan, and characters the camera picks out soon die. A White Cossack officer kills a Hungarian and is executed by his own superiors when he tries to rape a milkmaid. At the hospital, White officers order nurses into the woods, dressed in finery, to waltz. A nurse aids the Reds, then they accuse her of treason for following White orders. Red soldiers walk willingly, singing, into an overwhelming force. War seems chaotic and arbitrary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was surprised to read that some people feel this film is communist propaganda.  It is a very sparse, minimalist evocation of the senselessness of war.  The characters treat one another not as humans but as machines. "Stand here."  "Go there."  I found it compelling and 10 years after seeing this film, I have not forgotten it.  This is not soviet realism.  This is a stylized account of the dehumanization of war.  You cannot indulge in sentimental tears after seeing this.  You can only shake your head at man's stupidity and inhumanity.</p>
