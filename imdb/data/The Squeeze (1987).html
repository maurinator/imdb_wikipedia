<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Heroic effort to show the terrible side of life in USA...dark piers and the East river, grave of so many souls. The lottery drawing scene with the crowd of zombie participants reminded me of German Rallies, evangelists who are just users and other disturbing mob behaviors. The influence of organized crime international and totally outside the law has now assumed the aspects of pre-Organized Crime Committee Investigations and convictions. We now have corporations run exactly like criminal enterprises. A bit rough at times, the reality had to be dream-like as the tabloid press reality would be too shocking to show as entertainment. Greed and corruption are now tearing this country apart and gambling continues to be a vice with unending destruction and cheating. Don't gamble.</p>
