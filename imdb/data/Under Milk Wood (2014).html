<h1>Under Milk Wood (2014)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Under Milk Wood is the famous play for voices and is one of the events screened by the BBC to mark the centenary of the birth of Dylan Thomas. The play has an omniscient narrator that invites you to listen to the dreams and inner thoughts of the residents of a fictional small fishing village in Wales.Featured locations include the poet's favourite pubs in New York and west Wales. More importantly it was filmed across the globe from New York, Los Angeles to Laugharne and Cardiff.The BBC have gathered some Welsh voices ranging from music such as Tom Jones who plays Captain Cat to Charlotte Church, Bryn Terfel and Katherine Jenkins. There are Welsh superstars from across the pond who give the time to take part such as Matthew Rhys, Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Sheen, as well as veterans such as Sian Phillips and Jonathan Pryce.The cast seem to be having fun whilst reciting the play which makes it infectious. Its the first time I have heard the play, having heard so much of the Richard Burton rendition. I can guess its not for everyone but the visual tricks taken by the director to make this accessible as well as the starry Welsh cast makes this worthwhile viewing.</p>
