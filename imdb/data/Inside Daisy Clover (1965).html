Daisy's mother does not fit into that story. With the help of Daisy's social climbing older sister Gloria Goslett, Raymond arranges for Mrs. Clover to be committed, Daisy not to see her, as to the movie going public, her mother died the previous year.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>INSIDE DAISY CLOVER is a could have been good movie. Good plot and story line, but the execution doesn't work. Part of the Natalie Wood collection, CLOVER is about a young slum type girl who wants to be a singer. She submits a record and before you can blink, a studio head wants to test her. Now that only happens in the "movies". Natalie Wood is much to old for the role, but she has many good scenes. Not one character in this movie is sane except for the Roddy McDowell character, but he has so little to do that one wonders what he's doing in the film at all. The movie is very slow paced, yet there seems to be chunks deleted which make the story hard to follow. The ending is very lame. Another strange factor to this strange movie is that the studio scenes are eerie. This is supposed to be the 30's when film making was at its peak, yet there is virtually no one at the studio. The streets and lots are barren of people and even the sound stage which should be full of hustle, bustle is void of people except for a couple of camera men. Also, as studio head, Chris Plummer is always around which is unreal in that he has other stars and VIP's to contend with. Even the studio offices are devoid of people. Very strange indeed. The film depicts the Daisy character of wanting to sing and be in movies, but when she gets the chance she does nothing but sulk and seem unhappy at her success!! Extraordinary. It's been noted that Natalie herself said that she wasn't right for the role and that Tuesday Weld should have played Daisy. Amen.</p>
