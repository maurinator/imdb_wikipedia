<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>James Bond 007 is on the search for a Russian decoding machine, known as Lektor. Bond needs to find this machine, before the evil SPECTRE organization discovers it first. Whilst being romantically linked with Russian girl, Tatiana Romanova, Bond sneaks his way around Istanbul, whilst each SPECTRE agent tries to pick him off, including the over powering Donald 'Red' Grant and ex-KGB agent Rosa Klebb who knows all the tricks in the books and even possesses an incredible poison tipped shoe!</p>
<p>The SPECTRE Number 1 assigns the SPECTRE Number 3, Rosa Klebb, an ex-SMERSH operative before defecting from Russia, and the SPECTRE Number 5 and expert planner Kronsteen to plot a scheme to steal the Russian's Lektor decoder and revenge on James Bond for killing Dr. No. Rosa Klebb recruits the SPECTRE assassin Grant and lures the naive and loyal Russian Corporal State Security Tatiana Romanova, who works at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul and believes that Rosa Klebb still works for SMERSH. Meanwhile M summons James Bond and tells that Tatiana wants to defect to London and has offered the Lektor as part of the bargain. However, she wants to go to England with Bond. Bond and M suspect that it might be a trap, but Bond sees Tatiana's photo and decides to go to Istanbul, where he has the support of the local operative Kerim Bey. He meets Tatiana and they plot a plan to steal the Lektor and return to London. But they do not know that they are actually pawns in the scheme plotted by SPECTRE.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hard to believe, but the movie is actually an improvement on Fleming's novel.  Rather than have the Lektor operation be a simple Russian scheme to discredit Bond as Fleming did, SPECTRE takes a hand here in their first on-screen appearance as an organization.  The plot is improved considerably because of this.  The movie thrives on its supporting actors and Sheybal. Connery is somewhat outshone by these greater lights, but gives a credible performance.  From Russia... is a different pace of movie:  no one here is intent on wiping out the world's population, or destroying the gold supply, or stealing submarines.  Basically, it's a quiet little plot focusing on an elaborate "sting" operation.  Until the end, the pace is kind of slow, and might lose more "modern" audiences, particularly those used to incredible stunt sequences every 20 minutes.</p>
