<h1>The Big Chill (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A seminal Thirty-Something movie in which a group of old college friends who are now all grown up and hardened by the big wide world come together for the funeral of Alex, a barely glimpsed corpse, who was at one time the brightest and the best of them, and yet who never managed to achieve half as much as any of the others. The friends use the occasion to reacquaint themselves with each other and to speculate as to what happened to their idealism which had been abundant when they were younger.</p>
<p>A group of friends who attended the University of Michigan together in the 1960's convene for the funeral of one from their group, Alex, who committed suicide. The group, each now in their thirties, have kept in touch over the years, but have drifted somewhat apart as their respective lives changed. Their individual ideals have also changed from their socially conscious and radical days in college, to where they mostly now live outwardly comfortable and financially lucrative lives. With Alex's young and socially naive girlfriend, Chloe, added to the mix, the friends spend the weekend together at married couple Harold and Sarah's house in South Carolina following the funeral. Especially in light of Alex's suicide, the friends discuss their lives and collective relationships with each other, then and now.</p>
<p>A group of seven former college friends gather for a weekend reunion at a South Carolina winter house after the funeral of one of their friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It took a little while for me to really get into the film, but in the end, I was hooked.  Once I got to know a little about each of the characters, I found it hard not to care about each and every one of them.  Yes, it was dialogue-heavy, but once I liked the people on-screen, the conversations became rather engrossing.  Even if lots of talking doesn't sound too appealing, I still think you should give it a look, because it isn't too often that a film has a cast that is so hugely talented.  And of course, this film has one of the greatest soundtracks in movie history, and these songs seem to fit the mood perfectly.  I had high expectations for this film, and although it wasn't quite what I had expected, this film did not disappoint.</p>
