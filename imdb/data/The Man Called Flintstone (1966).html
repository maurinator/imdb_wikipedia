<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie based on the famous TV series may be one of the best annimated movies ever made.  It is a spoof of James Bond movies of the era.  The script is well written with an interesting story line and an exciting ending.  The musical numbers are fun too.  There is a song that Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm sing where they are dreaming about their futures and the visuals during the song are animated in stick figures that look to be drawn by kids. This has to be the cutest song and animation that I have ever seen.</p>
