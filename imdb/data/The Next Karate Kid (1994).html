<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rating: 5/10Why don't try-hard filmmakers just stop making fools of themselves by sequelizing The Karate Kid? Then the film world would be much more pleasant. This sequel, The Next Karate Kid starts quite well. It hits the mark on the first few lots of 5 minutes and I was possibly interested in seeing the rest of it. Unfortunately, the film faults itself a lot after the promising beginning. The ending in particular is offensive with stupidity and completely overblown. Hilary Swank and Pat Morita handle their main character leads with great emotion, despite some of the cheesy dialogue they are given. The story behind the martial arts is about Julie (Swank) and her best friend, Angel, a bird with a broken wing. Most of the scenes with Angel are touching, and win points for the film. However, the villains are completely laughable and the story leads to times that are so unrealistic that you kind of feel pain for the paper the script has been written on. The film has some mildly good ideas, but overall it fails to make you want to keep watching unless you have absolutely nothing else to do.</p>
