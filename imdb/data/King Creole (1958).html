<h1>King Creole (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Having flunked graduation for a second time and needing cash to support his crabby (and thus unemployed) father, Danny Fisher takes a job as a singer in the King Creole nightclub - about the only joint around not run by smarmy crook Maxie Fields who wants him for his own place. He gets on pretty well with Fields' floozy though, and all this plus his involvement with Fields' hoods and with innocent five-and-dime store assistant Nellie means Danny finds his world closing in on him all ways round.</p>
<p>Danny Fisher, young delinquent, flunks out of high school. To make ends meet he works as a busboy in a nightclub until one night when he gets the chance to perform as a singer. Success is imminent and the local crime boss Maxie Fields wants to hire him to perform at his night club The Blue Shade. Danny refuses, but Fields won't take no for an answer...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>King Creole is not only a great Elvis Presly movie, it's a great movie period. Elvis is simply terrific as hard-edged Danny Fisher, a street wise punk who hits it big time as a singer in a flashy New Orl√©ans club, run by sleazy Matthau.   The overall look of the film is excellent, it's fast paced and gritty, moody and athmospheric, and directed by the same man who brought us Casablanca.  The dialouge is good and seems authentic enough, Presley is excellent and Matthau is great (as always).  Plus, the songs are good. 9 out of 10.</p>
