<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A man and his pregnant wife arrive on the isolated island of Almanzora to find it almost entirely deserted the only visible population seems to be composed of children.When they finally spy an adult,they watch in horror as a little girl beats the man to death with his own walking stick."Who Can Kill a Child?" mixes socio-political themes with extremely eerie atmosphere of isolation and hopelessness.The tension builds slowly until it reaches incredibly horrifying climax.A sequence in which Lewis Fiander and Prunella Ransome walk through the village,gingerly stepping past the children who have gathered to watch them is extremely creepy.The children also do a terrific job-they are truly threatening and chilling.The photography by Jose Luis Alcane is wonderful and the soundtrack by Waldo De Los Rios is fantastic.Still the film is really unsettling,so if you are easily disturbed don't watch it.10 out of 10.</p>
