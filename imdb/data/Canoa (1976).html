<h1>Canoa (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of students take a bus to go to a small town, in order to finish a professional practice. All of them are friends, and they decide to sing some modern songs, while the other passengers are trying to sleep. One of the passengers gets angry and shouts "stop rowing", so they shut up. But when they arrive in the town, and after knowing the incident, everybody treats them as if they were criminals.</p>
<p>A group of students arrives in a small town during a hiking expedition. Once there, the local priest accuses them of being communist agitators on the run from an army crack-down against student demonstrations in nearby Mexico City and rallies the townsfolk to lynch them. Based on true facts occurred in the town of Canoa in 1968.</p>
<p>In 1968, four University of Puebla employees on a mountain climbing trip were attacked and beaten, and two people were killed, by the townspeope of San Miguel de Canoa. The mob violence was apparently incited by a local priest, who had been warning the townspeope that leftists from the city would be coming to kill him. Felipe Cazals' retelling of this real-life tragedy unfolds as a faux docmuentary. There is a narrator who provides context as we are shown a landscape of rural poverty and clerical power. Cazals made the film in 1975 as a metaphor for the massacre of students in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Mexico City district of Tlatelolco on October 2, 1968 a massacre the truth of which is still not known.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched Canoa when it first came out to the movie theaters; I was around 15 and I had lived the 1968's student movement. Tlatelolco massacre was fresh in our minds and hearts and while not referring directly to it, Canoa catches that feeling with honesty and courage. This two qualities are always present in Cazal's work, but this film is his master piece.We have also tho see Cazal's films in the context of the Mexican cinema of the moment, along with the work of Arturo Ripstein, Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, Jorge Fons and many other talented filmmakers. In Mexico their work tend to be overlooked mostly for political reasons.Mario de la Garza</p>
