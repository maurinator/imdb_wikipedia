<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was just reading the Amores Perros reviews and someone mentioned that it seemed if you liked one you'd hate the other and vice versa.  Well let's just say I LOVED Amores Perros and in my case the reviewer was right.Well actually I'm exaggerating.  I didn't hate this film, but I thought it was definitely a step backwards for Mexican filmmakers.  I left the theater thinking it was an okay film, and was later shocked to see the kind of critical acclaim it's getting.  Best foreign film nominee???  It wasn't one fourth as good as Monsoon Wedding (2001?) or City of God.  I don't have my films of the year ranking spreadsheet handy, but I don't think it was even in my top 30.  Maybe people want to say they liked it so everyone will know they could handle an X (oh sorry, NT-17/non-rated) art film?  If you've got nothing better to do, okay rent it.  But if you want to see something great, find something else. 6/10</p>
