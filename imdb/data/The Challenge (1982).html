<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This isn't an award winning film. This isn't a well known film. But it has a good premise and is  one of my secret pleasures. Two Brothers in a long standing feud over an ancient family sword  and an American "dupe" that's been thrown into the fray. We watch his journey and education  in a different culture with different values (yet oddly similar to ours, and riddled with similar  weaknesses.)The reason I know I like this one (even with all the flaws) is that it keeps coming to mind  from time to time. And after some thought, I think it boils down to basic examinations of how to live one's life. How important is Honor? Is it better to take the quick and easy $ or to work for it? How important are family bonds? Are the modern ways of life any better than the traditional ones? Is it ever too late to turn your life around? And so forth. These are why I like this movie. Sure it can come off as a bit preachy about duty, honor, loyalty and traditional ways, but it has always made me think about what is the best way to live one's life.</p>
