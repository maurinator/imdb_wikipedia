<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Shiralee ends on a curious note. Will it's protagonist Peter Finch ever shape up and realize he has responsibilities? After watching it today I kind of wonder.I doubt during the days of The Code whether a lead character like Finch ever could have been in an American film. He's charming and determined to seed those wild oats until the well runs dry. One of those wild oats became Dana Wilson his little daughter and the two live like vagabonds, not unlike the Carmody family in The Sundowners.They're not enjoying life like the Carmodys though. Finch takes work where he can find it in the Australian national industry of sheep raising. There's no family unity here as the Carmodys have because Finch is totally estranged from his wife Elizabeth Sellars. He's also not picking things up either with another former flame Rosemary Harris. And another little side dalliance with shop girl Barbara Archer is the cause of some near tragedy.If Finch can ever stop thinking with his male member there's a chance he might just finally grow up. For the sake of his little girl he'd better.Despite all these character defects Finch being the great actor that he is does make you have a rooting interest in his hopefully eventual maturity. The Shiralee is a wonderful picture of Australia in the 50s and even today one of the most optimistic places I've ever visited. This one is a real charmer and don't let it get away.</p>
