<h1>Uncle Vanya (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A retired professor has returned to his estate to live with his beautiful young wife, Yelena. The estate originally belonged to his first wife, now deceased; her mother and brother still live there and manage the farm. For many years the brother (Uncle Vanya) has sent the farm's proceeds to the professor, while receiving only a small salary himself. Sonya, the professor's daughter, who is about the same age as his new wife, also lives on the estate. The professor is pompous, vain, and irritable. He calls the doctor (Astrov) to treat his gout, only to send him away without seeing him. Astrov is an experienced physician who performs his job conscientiously, but has lost all idealism and spends much of his time drinking. The presence of Yelena introduces a bit of sexual tension into the household. Astrov and Uncle Vanya both fall in love with Yelena; she spurns them both. Meanwhile, Sonya is in love with Astrov, who fails even to notice her. Finally, when the professor announces he wants to sell the estate, Vanya, whose admiration for the man died with his sister, tries to kill him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I disagree with previous comments. This a perfect production of UNCLE VANYA, one of the world's great dramas. We should be thankful that the stage production was recorded so that all of us can continue to enjoy and be moved by these brilliant performances. Michael Redgrave and Joan Plowright are particularly moving, but Olivier as Astrov and the lovely Rosemary Harris and the legendary Fay Compton are also memorable. Yes, it is not presented in an artificially cinematic style. With this play and this production that doesn't matter. In fact, the nature of the play demands that the camera focus on the faces and body language of the actors. It's their emotions, their reactions to each other that matter. With the camera so close to them, we can see them lying to each other and to themselves. Heartbreaking, brilliant, and unforgettable. A masterful rendition of a masterpiece.</p>
