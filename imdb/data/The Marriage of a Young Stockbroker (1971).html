<h1>The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A stock-broker is stuck in a dreary job and a marriage that's become a dull routine. To cope with the boredom and frustration, he resorts to voyeurism and extramarital love affairs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Richard Benjamin shines in the title role as a young man who is disillusioned by his job, marriage and life in general. Joanna Shimkus is attractive and vivacious as his troubled wife, Lisa. Fine support from Patricia Barry as the psychiatrist and especially good are Elizabeth Ashley and Adam West as Benjamin's in-laws. Look fast for familiar faces Ron Masak and Bob Hastings as baseball fans and the alluring Tiffany Bolling is also memorable. A film that Fox should release for sale.</p>
