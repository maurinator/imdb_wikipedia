<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sure, it was not meant to be an oscar winner, but this is the kind of film all the family can enjoy. It has elements of a teen comedy, drama and action. This film is the kind that you can watch over, without getting bored. It is not crude like most teen comedies, and relies on structure and characterisation to push the plot along, which is a nice touch. This movie is a nice film, one for all to enjoy!</p>
