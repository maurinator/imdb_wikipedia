<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when it came out in the theatres and I loved it.  I haven't been able to find a copy yet.  It is only listed on  the IMDB.  I still use many of the lines I remember from the film.  Such as, "Do I have any mail?" to the mailman.  He says, "What's your name?"  She says, "Occupant"  Not as a smart alec reply but more in saddness.  She is 18 to 22 years old and applying for a job with a woman personel interviewer.  The lady asks if she has been convicted of a crime.  Bergan answers, "27 arrests, no convictions" The lady writes down "None"The other characters are all equally memorable and touching.  It is bittersweet and realistic, without becoming maudlin.  I reccommend that you see it if you get the chance.</p>
