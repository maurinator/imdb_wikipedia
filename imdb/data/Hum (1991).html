<p>Bhaktawar is a criminal mastermind, and his most active territory is the dockyard.

During a confrontation between Tiger and Bhaktawar, Bhaktawar is reportedly killed, and Tiger has to run for his life, this time from the police, even abandoning his love Jumalina Gonsalves. Years later, Tiger surfaces as a bespectacled mild-mannered man, with two younger brothers, one of whom is a police inspector. Soon the past catches up with Tiger (or Shekhar as he calls himself now), and he must now come to terms with it, and avoid being arrested by his brother.</p>
<p>Mainly a Thriller/Drama about corrupt police officers, crime rings and workers unions, the story of Hum is about a man named Tiger, who works, reluctantly, for the criminal Bhaktawar collecting 'protection money.' However, Tiger also helps the poor and leads protests against Bhaktawar's actions. He loves his family, and he loves his girlfriend Jumma even though their relationship seems to be a stormy one. Bhaktawar decides to bump off Tiger, but accidentally kills his parents instead, leaving Tiger to care for his two little step-brothers alone. The corrupt police inspector, Giridhar, takes advantage of this situation and, intending to steal Bhaktawar's fortune, frames Tiger for killing Bhaktawar's family before himself arresting Bhaktawar, thus ensuring that there will be no one to complain when he takes the money for himself. The story then picks up 15 years later: Tiger has changed his name to Shekhar and lives in the country with his two brothers, who are both adults now and one of whom is even married. Jumma, whom he was forced to leave in order to flee with his brothers, has become a famous actress and is still waiting for Tiger to come back to her. Inspector Giridhar has become rich from Bhaktawar's stolen fortune. And also, Bhaktawar himself has just been released from jail, and he wants revenge on the man he thinks murdered his family -- Tiger.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent comedy/drama/action film. I have seen this film so many times since I was young. I like the three songs - Ek Doosre Se Karte Hain Pyaar Hum, Jumma Chumma De De and Batdance, it's so funny. I watched it again on freesat channel and youtube as well but there're some scenes are missing. I remember very well, I watched it on an original video (Apollo) and I also recorded it on channel 4 in 15 years ago, these scenes still there but sadly I lost it. Deleted Scenes1. Govinda's fake trophy. 2. Amitabh went to college to see Govinda's headteacher. 3. Extra song before ending credit - 'Ek Doosre Se Karte Hain Pyaar Hum'.</p>
