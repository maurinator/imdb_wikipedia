<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've red previous comments. Well, it seems you haven't be lucky with your copies of the movie. I saw it in Paris, when it came out, and it was a gorgeous coloured movie. I decided to buy the DVD, 4 days ago, and I watched it yesterday. Remastered, it was as fresh as left in my memory. Colours are perfect, voices too. But it's the original french movie. Where does your copies come from???? I can assure you that if you buy the original movie, you'll be seduced by the original tone, directly coming from the beginning of the seventies. The movie came out in 1970, I was anxious to be deceived, as often, because it could have had better days. Not at all, it was really oxygen in my tough life! The duet works very well, based on the antagonism of the characters/actors, Bardot, a"doll", rich and busiless, and Cassel, a weird musician, not poor, not rich. She lives in Paris, an entire rich and modern building, and spend her time by knowing she's a rich beauty, using men as Kleenex, divorcing as you go to the hairdresser. He lives in the country, in Bougival, near Paris, working as a violoncellist in the ORTF orchestra. He's got a son, no more wife, and three nieces he's cocooning with his son, because their parents are traveling all the time. Their family life is wealthy and simple, her life is aseptised and extravagant and, at the beginning of the movie, she is divorcing, giving a party same night, as she always does when she divorces. Always very rich men. Before the party, in the morning, she has to drive back her luxurious car, left in a street near Bougival, because she was too drunk to drive it back home safe. One of her ex-husbands, of course, very rich, lets her drive one of his Rolls- Royces. She accidentally meets Cassel, driving his 2 Chevaux, witch is a little Citroen car, very resistant, as it seems... After that, it's the eternal chassé-croisé between the two members of the couple. When she wants, he doesn't and when he finally comes to her, she doesn't want him anymore. But he does persist, and the doll goes into the bear's arms voluptuously.</p>
