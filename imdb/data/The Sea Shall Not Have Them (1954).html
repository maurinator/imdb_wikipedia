<h1>The Sea Shall Not Have Them (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During autumn of 1944, an RAF Hudson carrying a VIP passenger in possession of highly secret information is shot down and ditches in the North Sea. Fighting the elements and trying to keep up morale, the occupants of the aircraft's dinghy talk about their lives awaiting the rescue they hope will come. The film's title reflects the motto of the RAF's Air Sea Rescue Service, one of whose high speed launches battles against its own mechanical problems, enemy action, time and the weather to locate and rescue the downed crew and the vital secret papers they carry.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this film from a muddy looking print currently on YouTube. I hope there are better quality copies out there.This movie is about an air-sea rescue crew in action during WWII. A plane is shot down over the North Sea. What makes this one particularly important is that an agent on board is carrying super- important secrets about the German rocket program. Because of this, an all-out search is conducted by the Brits. The film bounces back and forth between the downed crew on a life raft as well as folks in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy as they try to locate them despite lousy weather and a HUGE search area.This film is probably not one with wide commercial appeal. While it excels at realism, this also makes for a relatively dull film. Despite this, the film has nice production values and some very nice acting (including the likes of Dirk Bogarde and Michael Redgrave). Probably of most interest to war film buffs. Regardless, though the pacing and style is a bit dull, it does, fortunately, end with more energy and emotion.</p>
