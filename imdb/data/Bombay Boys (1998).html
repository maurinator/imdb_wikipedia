<h1>Bombay Boys (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Krishna alias Kris Sahani lives in New York, U.S., but decides to travel to his homeland in order to act in a movie. While Ricardo Fernandes leaves Sydney, Australia to travel to Bombay in search of his missing brother, Roger. And finally, Zeres Mistry, from London, England, also travels to Bombay to find his true love. The paths of all three Non-resident Indians cross in the taxi ride to Colaba, and they decide to stick together in their search for an apartment. They do succeed in finding one, owned by a seemingly gay landlord, Pesi Shroff, who openly and lovingly eyes a visibly uncomfortable Zeres. Things do not go well for Kris as well as he is asked by Filmmaker, Don Mastana, to act in a movie that is slated to be the worst movie in Bollywood history. Ricardo finds himself at the mercy of the local police, who make it clear to him that they have better things to do than look for his missing brother. It is only a matter of time before the hapless trio to realize that their respective hopes, dreams and aspirations are soon to turn to hopelessness and nightmares - from which there is no escape.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is based on the experience of three NRI's on their first visit to Bombay.Krishna(Naveen Andrews seen in "The Buddha of Suburbia";"Wild West";"The English Patient")from New York drama school is looking for a subtantial role in Hollywood but is forced to act in Mastana's(Naseeruddin Shah)"bummer" film,Mumbai Banditos. Xerxes, a violinist from London, is in Bombay to "find himself" while Ricardo(Rahul Bose)is searching for his lost brother.Bombay Boys is a film with a mature message. For once it's not on how western culture/NRI's are ruining India's traditions & values (a la "Pardes";"Aa Ab Laut Chale";"Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rahte Hai" et al)but for moving with times & simultaneously salvaging India's culture.Gifford & Bose perform well.Naveen Andrews -"Kama Sutra";"My Own Country" & Tara Deshpande-"Bada Din"& "Is Raat Ki Subha Nahin" are spectacular. However the most outrageous yet credible performance is from Naseeruddin Shah.Khaizad Gustad's direction is great.The soundtrack is worthlistening too. Bombay Boys - a must see!!!</p>
