<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>THE RESCUERS, in my opinion, is a pure Disney blockbuster. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Bernard (voice of Bob Newhart) and Bianca (voice of Eva Gabor) set out on their mission to rescue Penny (voice of Michelle Stacy). If you ask me, Medusa's (voice of Geraldine Page) clothing was nice, but her hair was absolutely atrocious. To me, it really did look like snakes. That made it obvious as to why her name was Medusa. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney blockbuster to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.</p>
