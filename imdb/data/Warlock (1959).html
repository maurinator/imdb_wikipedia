<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The town of Warlock is plagued by a gang of thugs, leading the inhabitants to hire Clay Blaisdell, a famous gunman, to act as marshal. When Blaisdell appears, he is accompanied by his friend Tom Morgan, a club-footed gambler who is unusually protective of Blaisdell's life and reputation. However, Johnny Gannon, one of the thugs who has reformed, volunteered to accept the post of official deputy sheriff in rivalry to Blaisdell; and a woman arrives in town accusing Blaisdell and Morgan of having murdered her fianc√©. The stage is set for a complex set of moral and personal conflicts.</p>
<p>A famous gunman becomes the marshal of Warlock to end a gang's rampages, but is met with some opposition by a former gang member turned deputy sheriff who wants to follow only legal methods.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This great film never got the recognition it deserved. Edward Dmytryk had a lot of problems starting in 1947, because he was an ex member of the communist party, he ended up in jail, and eventually revealed some names that apparently were common knowledge. Richard Widmark is Johnny Gannon a man who changes and also changes sides. He was a member of McQuown's gang and in spite of his brother remaining in the gang he becomes the marshal. He is very much like Marlon Brando in "On The Waterfront" which was made by Elia Kazan who had the same political problems. Henry Fonda is hired to clean the town and he comes along with his partner Anthony Quinn. Fonda falls in love with Dolores Michaels and wants to change(get married and settle down) but Quinn has a terrible fear of changing and being alone. There is nothing homosexual in their friendship-partnership, only too much mutual dependency.</p>
