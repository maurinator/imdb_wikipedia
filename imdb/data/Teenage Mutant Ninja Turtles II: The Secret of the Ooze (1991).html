<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the early 90s, everywhere you went you'd see something related to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The craze took the country by storm and kids like you and I were nuts for it. The first feature film was both a hit at the box office and with youngsters, so it was only natural that we get a sequel, right? New Line Cinema wasted no time and the following year we were given number 2. It too was a hit, but was it even as good as the original? Some seem to think so, some even like it more. I like it, but nowhere near as much.Pros: Acting is decent. More of that corny, yet endearing humor. Moves at an OK pace. As usual the Jim Henson people did a nice job on the animatronics. Some breathtaking shots of New York City. The fight scenes are fun, plus the choreography has improved. A pretty cool final showdown.Cons: Lacks some of the energy and fun of the first. Putting everyone in the middle of a Vanilla Ice concert just dates the film. Plus much of it feels like they were trying to pad the running time.Final thoughts: This first of two sequels isn't bad, in fact it's pretty darn entertaining. But like a lot of sequels that came out a year or less after it's predecessor, it feels like it was made for money and nothing more. Still if you're a fan then it's worth seeing.My rating: 3/5</p>
