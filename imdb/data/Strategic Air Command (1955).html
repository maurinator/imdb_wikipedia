<h1>Strategic Air Command (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lt. Col. Robert (Dutch) Holland was a third baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, not a pitcher. While at spring training a B-36 flew over the field and Dutch was standing on third base. Brewster was his third base replacement when he, Dutch was re-called to duty. The movie clearly depicts this.</p>
<p>An ex-pilot and current baseballer is recalled into the U.S. Air Force and assumes an increasingly important role in Cold War deterrence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jimmy Stewart was, in real life, a Brigadier General in the United States Air Force and a distinguished combat (bomber) pilot of WWII. He played the part of "Dutch" Holland realistically because he had lived the Air Force life and knew all the intimate details. In the days when the Soviet Bear was a genuine menace and America's populace was Hell-bent on sticking it's collective head in the sand, men and women like these served in the now-long-gone Strategic Air Command, the Guardian of our severely depleted post-WWII air armada. Wonderfully photographed and skillfully recreated, Strategic Air Command portrays an honest,almost-documentary,image of the rebuilding of America's Air Force which prevented WW-III! It is still very popular in TV reruns due to the fact that America loves hero's and Peace! Remember, the SAC motto was "Peace is Our Profession!" For those of us who served in SAC, this movie stands as a memorial and testimonial to our work and our love of country! Thanks,Jimmy!</p>
