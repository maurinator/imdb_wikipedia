<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>New Dehli is an excellent movie with the right amount of every emotion. The plot is simple, Anand (Kishore Kumar) is Punjabi and comes to New Dehli to look for a room to rent. Because he goes to a Bengali's house to get the room, he is told that the room is already taken. But the truth is that the owner wanted it to be rented to a Bengali...so he decides that on his next venture he should go as someone from the owner's state. So he dresses up as a Madrasi and goes to a Madrasi's house whose room was for rent...and easily he gets the room.Meanwhile, he keeps on bumping into Janaki (Vyjayantimala) and they always quarrel. Circumstances bring him to accidentally go into a Natyam and Sangeet school where nevertheless Janaki is the head of. They start to get to know each other...but keep in mind that Anand is still in the impersonation of a Madrasi.Soon, Anand needs more people to cover up for him, he uses his naukar (Dhoomal) to play his dad, though he was unwilling. So the plot goes on, but after a stage dance, the true dad of Anand (Nasir Hussain) is introduced. Uh oh! He's in big trouble now. Janaki's dad forbids her to meet Anand again, and decides to quickly arrange her marriage to a Madrasi.Janaki is heartbroken when Anand has no other way to make their plans work, saying he is helpless. That same day her dad gets furious with her, knowing that she had gone to meet Anand again. "Issa acha hota ke tum paida hoke margayi! (It would have been better for you to die after you were born)" yells her dad. Janaki couldn't take it anymore and goes to commit suicide.But her uncle stops her, and soon they come with a plan that is sure to save the marriage and change the biased ways of how people think.This is such an entertaining movie! Kishore Kumar is sooo funny, and even Vyjayantimala is. She's beautiful as usual, and her tragic acting is marvelous. She has three dances, and Kishore has one. The songs are all beautifully composed by Shankar Jaikishan, each one of the numbers are unique and sound nothing like the other. Lata's voice is beautiful and so is Kishore's. Vyjayantimala has a Bharatha Natyam, Khatak, Filmi, Bhangra, and even a small Oddisi dance.I love this movie and I would totally recommend it to anyone out there, you will surely be entertained with everyone's performance, and the direction is very good by Mohan Seigal...and all in all it teaches us all a lesson ~ a good moral. I give it a ten out of ten.</p>
