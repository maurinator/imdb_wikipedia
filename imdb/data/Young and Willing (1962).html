<h1>Young and Willing (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Harry Brown (Ian McShane in his introductory film role) is a somewhat rough student (the wild) at Kilminster University, who has the ability to win friends, especially the underdogs like Phil (John Hurt) who doesn't play 'rugger' and can't sink a whole pint of beer, and African student Reggie (Johnny Sekka). He also has a way with the girls (the willing), one of whom is his professors wife, who likes the students, but also her comfortable life with her boring husband more. After Harry is rebuffed, he takes up the challenge to hang a banner from the dangerously crumbling University tower. The rather weak Phil insists on being part of this escapade. This is a rather interesting film showing a University of the early 60s as a melting pot where many different rungs of society meet, and its message is still relevant today.</p>
<p>University students form relationships and perform pranks with disastrous consequences all round.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw some of this film being shot around Lincoln Cathedral, an area not condusive to great film making. The film is important because of the debut of three future stars. Firstly the brigadier's daughter Samantha Eggar (older half sister of the also beautiful Toni) who went onto fame in The Collector and, for U.S. audiences, Dr Dolittle. Faded from view pretty quickly. Secondly Ian McShane who has had a long career, more in the U.K., but has been in some U.S blockbuster miniseries. He is also known to A&E audiences for his portrayal of a lovable, rascally antique dealer in the hilarious "LoveJoy'series. Last but certainly the best known is John Hurt who has proven himself in the International cinema as a highly respected actor and star. Don't watch the film watch the people.</p>
