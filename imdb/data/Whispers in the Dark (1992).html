<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A psychiatrist (Sciorra) is helping a neurotic art gallery owner who has a submissive and very satisfying sexual relationship with her new lover, a domineering man with a violent streak. An airline pilot that the psychiatrist recently started dating turns out to be having an affair with the patient. When someone is murdered, the psychiatrist must decide whether the lover is a homicidal maniac or someone who loves her. Her mentor and his wife attempt to help her, but things aren't what they seem.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist Ann Hecker is ending one relationship and possibly starting an important new one, while finding that some of the sexual exploits her patients relate are weighing on her. Turning to a married friend from her research days for guidance, she finds his help increasingly important when a female patient is murdered and it turns out that her new boyfriend was also seeing the dead woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a tacky, low-grade mystery film that is far better acted than most of its kind. It's about a lady psychiatrist with some really messed-up patients who gets caught up in a murder mystery when one patient becomes a suspect. Nearly all of the characters in this story are serious head cases. One hopes no major city has a preponderance of people like that. A lot of twists and turns occur in the story. A few of them are compelling, most of them improbable. Some genuinely talented actors were rounded up to appear in this film. Largely as a result, the film is watchable, but it's just as miss-able. Only die hard fans of murder mysteries will enjoy this film.</p>
