<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Empire is rebuilding the Death Star and planning a big attack on the Rebels. Meanwhile back on Tatooine, the evil Jabba the Hutt is causing trouble. He also has in his possession Han Solo, who's been frozen in carbonite in the last adventure, so in a land speeder, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca and Princess Leia rush to Jabba's palace. After a treacherous ride over cliffs and rocks, you arrive. Leia is dressed as bounty hunter Boush. You rescue Han Solo, then you must defeat Bib Fortuna, survive the Rancor pit, treacherous rides on Skiffs, and send Jabba the Hutt to an early grave! Soon after you all travel to the exotic moon of Endor, while Lando Calrissian leads Rebel pilots into a full scale attack on the Empire. Luke and Leia must survive a fast and furious Speeder rides, avoiding trees. Then they meet Wicket and the rest of the Ewoks who help rid the Ewok Village of Imperial Troops. Luke, meanwhile, heads into the forest and allows himself to be captured and taken onboard the Death Star where he must engage into a lightsaber battle with Darth Vader, and even the Emperor himself! And then, Lando flies the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star and destroys the breaking point, which is the good news because the Death Star will now simultaneously combust. The bad news: you've got to zoom out of there at the speed of light, avoiding walls and small ceilings! If you are successful, the Death Star will once and for all be blown away into the heavens, and the Rebels will live happily ever after.</p>
