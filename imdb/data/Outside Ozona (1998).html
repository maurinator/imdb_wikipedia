<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A serial killer is on the prowl in the badlands of Ozona, Oklahoma, and the travelers who intersect at a roadside cafeteria somewhere between Texas and New Mexico are destined to cross his path. They include a circus clown and his stripper girlfriend, grieving sisters, a trucker, and a woman who is taking her mother to see the ocean before she dies. Tying everything together even tighter is the presence of the local radio station, whose DJ and boss don't seem to be getting along too well.</p>
<p>A serial killer is stalking the roads between New Mexico and Texas and the passengers that we meet are destined to become his victims. We meet our parties at a cafeteria where a trucker stops for coffee. In the restaurant are a woman who has run out of gas and is trying to get her grandmother to the coast one last time before she dies, a fired and broke circus clown trying to get to Vegas with his stripper girl friend, and sisters who are going to their father's funeral. The killer is easy to spot. While all of the mayhem is ongoing, all motorists are tuned into a local DJ who is feuding with his station manager.</p>
<p>A drama revolving around a group of strangers brought together by a common occurrence as well as listening to the same radio station.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is far from the best I've ever seen but its definitely the best B-movie I've ever seen. The structure is Tarantino like with some of the familiar gore. However, this film does not attempt to be funny. This is a gritty, down to earth film following the stories of several likable characters through conversations eventually leading to a huge climax bringing them all together. This is the type of film you should watch late at night on the couch for the simple reason that you don't expect too much so you get a lot more than you hoped for in a B movie. And now for some very weird reason i have to make up ten lines of text. That should do it.</p>
