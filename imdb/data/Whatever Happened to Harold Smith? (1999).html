<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is absolutey delightful, a combination of a well-written and hilarious script, and some amazing art direction.  Every scene in this movie presents its audience with an eyeful of imaginative staging.  If you liked the movie The Royal Tennenbaums, see this... its more funny and even more visually rich.</p>
