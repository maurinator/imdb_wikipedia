<h1>A Caixa (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stories about neighboring in Lisbon are told by a homeless blind man who's only means of support is his elm box.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Certainly a masterpiece... The old Manoel de Oliveira presented us with a fine comedy, where everything falls apart, very dark humour and questions on the human nature.The best of Oliveira, even for those who don't like his  work.</p>
