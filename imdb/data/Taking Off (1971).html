<h1>Taking Off (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I discovered this by accident, and have to wonder why it has been so ignored these last 22 years. Forman's take on the America of the late sixties is a beautiful mood piece, at times amusing, at times moving, but always acted, directed and written with subtlety and wit. I would reccomend this as a definative film about the culture of the Sixties.</p>
