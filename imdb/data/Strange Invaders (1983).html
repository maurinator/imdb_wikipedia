<h1>Strange Invaders (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Charlie's ex-wife disappears, and he travels to where she grew up--a rural town in the Midwest--to look for her. But, surprisingly, nobody knows about her or any of her many relatives, the Newmans. He meets aliens; but when he contacts the FBI, they don't believe him. He tells his story to a tabloid; and suddenly, he is chased by the aliens.</p>
<p>In 1958, in Centerville, Illinois, a spacecraft lands on the city in an alien invasion and the population vanishes. Twenty-five years later, Margaret Newman leaves her daughter Elizabeth in New York with her ex-husband Charles Bigelow, who is an entomologist and professor of Columbia, since she would go to her hometown Centerville to attend the funeral of her mother. Margaret disappears and Charles drives with his dog Louie to Centerville to seek out his ex-wife. He finds a weird population living in a typical 1958 town. While looking for Margaret, Louie disappears and Charles is attacked by an alien but he succeeds to escape. Back in New York, Charles visits a government department directed by Mrs. Benjamin to report his findings but she does not give credit to his words. Charles finds a tabloid newspaper with a picture of an alien and he visits the editor Betty Walker that discloses that she has made up the story using a photo that the newspaper received ten years ago from a lunatic. Soon Betty has a close encounter with an alien disguised as Avon Lady and is chased by them. So she teams up with Charles expecting to rescue Elizabeth from the extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a "smaller" science fiction film about aliens being discovered on Earth.  Excellent cast, intelligent story and suspense carry this well above others of its kind.  Well worth a viewing by fans of the genre.  Solid 8 according to the Miller Movie formula.</p>
