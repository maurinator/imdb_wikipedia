<h1>It's a Wonderful Life (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Donkey Kong is having one of those days. Seem like nothing he does is right - breaking Funky's surfboard;locking up the Crystal Coconut and losing the combinations;losing Diddy's lucky autographed ball. It's all going wrong. Maybe a nap will make the bad karma go away? Unless;of course;he sleeps through the annual Future Ruler of Kongo Bongo Barbecue Banana Dinner being held in his honour! Donkey Kong begins to think that Kongo bongo would be better off without him. And that's exactly what happens when Donkey Kong wakes up from a bump on his head. No one can see or hear him! Kongo Bongo Island has gone haywire - Diddy is running an evil empire;King K. Rool is trying to protect the Papier Mache Lily Pad;AND CANDY IS MARRIED TO BLUSTER!! Something tells me that this is not a good thing.</p>
