<h1>No Hunting (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A cartoon that satirizes hunting to the extreme. Donald Duck is inspired by his grandpappy to go hunting in the woods. Once there, all the hunters are greeted by hot dog vendors, ambulances, and fire engines. Nobody is going to be unprepared for the big day tomorrow when hunting season begins. The next day, the hunting is so intense that hunters use bazookas and tanks to catch their prey and are even parachuted out of airplanes onto the hunting grounds! After dodging some bullets and other chaos, Donald and his "grandpappy" finally leave the hunt with game, a cow (labelled "cow" by a local farmer so the hunters wouldn't confuse it for prey!).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon.The spirit of Donald's pioneer Grandpappy inspires him to get out and shoot some meat for the table.Nominated for an Academy Award, NO HUNTING is a very funny spoof of the habits & foibles of the American hunter. Bambi and his Mother make a surprise appearance; this was to be Grandpa Duck's only role in a Disney cartoon. Clarence Nash provides Donald with his unique voice.Walt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.</p>
