<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know how I found out about this movie to be honest. I think I was just really bored one day and bought it at a video store. But, I'm glad I did.The movie is both funny and creepy, and personally I couldn't stop watching. It was quite interesting.Story is simple but actually quite complex at the same time (if that makes any sense). 3 burglars (2 gangsters and a kid) from the slums break into the house of the landlords of a big apartment building, and become trapped inside and face the horrors that await them.The best performance was definitely Brandon Quintin Adams as Fool, the 13 year old boy who breaks into the house with the 2 other criminals, Leroy (an early but great performance by Ving Rhames) and Spenser (Jeremy Roberts). Everett McGill and Wendy Robie played a good, insane couple, Daddy and Mommy. And Sean Whalen was really good as Roach, the main child from the basement who lives in the walls.With a good mix of comedy, horror, and great characters, traps, atmosphere, People Under the Stairs should be part of any Horro lover's collection.9/10.</p>
