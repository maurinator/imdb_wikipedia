<h1>The Kid (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy L.A. image consultant, but as he nears 40, he's cynical, dogless, chickless, estranged from his father (Daniel von Bargen), and he has no memories of his childhood. One night he surprises an intruder (Spencer Breslin), who turns out to be a kid, almost 8 years old. There's something oddly familiar about the chubby lad, whose name is Rusty. The boy's identity sparks a journey into Russ's past that the two of them take - to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. Two long-suffering women look on with disbelief: Russ's secretary, Janet(Lily Tomlin), and his assistant, the lovely Amy, to whom Rusty takes a shine. What, and who, is at the end of this journey?</p>
<p>An unhappy and disliked image consultant gets a second shot at life when an eight year old version of himself mysteriously appears.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did.  The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it).  It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying?), but all in all and good time.  It also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring?  What do they expect at 40? How can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids?</p>
