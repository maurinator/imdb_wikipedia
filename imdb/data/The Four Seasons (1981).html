<h1>The Four Seasons (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three middle-aged wealthy couples take vacations together in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Along the way we are treated to mid-life, marital, parental and other crises.</p>
<p>Middle aged couples Jack and Kate Burroughs, Nick and Anne Callan, and Danny and Claudia Zimmer are best friends who do everything together. As couples, they have weathered the flood of divorces that have beset their other friends. When one of the six decides to make a change in life, the other five are forced to examine their marriages, their friendships with each other, the true meaning of love and their own personal foibles. Over the course of one year, the movie is set against the backdrop of four vacations they take together, one in each of the four seasons, with Antonio Vivaldi's associated suite of music introducing each. By their fourth vacation together, Jack feels that they need to "clear the air".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alan Alda the actor has come up with a few worthwhile projects over the years as a writer and director. This movie, his feature directorial debut, is quite enjoyable.Three upper-middle class couples are seen during the four vacations they take annually. They enjoy each others' company, but a fissure in the friendships begins to grows when one man tires of life with his wife and introduces his new, younger girlfriend into the group, and things go from there. Alda manages very successfully the balance between comedy and drama, aided by the excellent cast of veterans. All the principals here (the first seven listed in the credits) do fine work.</p>
