<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While there are those who are left cold by Norman Wisdom, I am not one of those people. In fact, I am quite fond of him. There Was a Crooked Man is my favourite film of his, and he couldn't have been more perfect here in his role as he teams up with crooks to outwit the mayor of a northern town. His role here allows him to maintain his poor but honest persona and his wide eyed innocence that makes him so endearing to me, but it is probably the most versatile of his roles as well. There Was a Crooked Man benefits further from striking filming, quirky music, fun direction and sparkling dialogue. In terms of performances, Wisdom makes the film for me, but he has some excellent foils also in the form of Alfred Marks and Andrew Cruishank. Then there is the comedy, There Was a Crooked Man in my opinion contains some of the best things Wisdom ever did. The bank robbery, the battle with the factory machinery and Brian Oulton taking a shower unaware that Wisdom is in the stall with him particularly stand out. In conclusion, a divine comedy and my favourite of a talented performer. 10/10 Bethany Cox</p>
