<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maybe I am crazy in the head (If I am, I enjoy every minute if it - heh heh), but I thought "Ghost in the Invisible Bikini" was the perfect synthesis of the earlier AIP beach and supernatural movies. With actors and actresses from hits like "Beach Party", "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine", "Die, Monster, Die" and so on, we end up with a highly campy, yet enjoyable plot. Boris Karloff is great as Hiram Stokely, the "corpse". Susan Hart playing the "Ghost" is great eye candy as she was in the original "Doctor Goldfoot" film, and the scenes in the graveyard and the chamber of horrors conjure up memories of the fine AIP supernatural/Poe films. And of course, with the rock and rollers including Nancy Sinatra conjuring up the earlier AIP beach movies - who can ask for more. Great camp - great fun throughout. 9/10.Dan Basinger</p>
