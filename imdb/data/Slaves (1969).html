<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nothing can be said about this being a great film. It isn't. The acting is amateurish and the story is pure melodrama that reeks of the staleness of another time in casting when broad caricature was passed off as great emoting. But the music is pure Bobby Scott, a jazz stylist with great command of a music form. Bobby was proud of his accomplishments as a songwriter and composer, and this one was no exception. He loved the fact that he got this one away from Burt Bacharach despite that it was done for that songwriter's golden goose, Dionne Warwick. So forget the hoky acting and plot. Listen to the sounds of the great Bobby Scott. (I should also mention that both the director/screenwriter Biberman and actress Gale Sondergard, were blacklisted talents so that at least makes this film noteworthy.) Okay so maybe it is historic in that it marks the acting debut of singer Dionne Warwick, but so what? She was no better than Gladys Knight as a thespian, and believe me, that is no compliment. Like I said. Watch the cinematography and listen to the music on the soundtrack and if you do anything else, don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
