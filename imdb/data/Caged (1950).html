<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frightened 19-year-old Marie Allen gets sent to an Illinois penitentiary for being an accomplice in an armed robbery. A sympathetic prison head tries to help, but her efforts are subverted by cruel matron Evelyn Harper. Marie's harsh experiences turn her from doe-eyed innocent to hard-nosed con.</p>
<p>Naive 19-year old Marie Allen is incarcerated for being an accessory to a minor robbery committed by her husband Tom, who was killed during the robbery. The prison, populated primarily by hardened career criminals, is run by warden Ruth Benton, who is trying to reform the penal system by running a humanistic prison. However she is at odds with sadistic matron Evelyn Harper, who is in charge of Marie's cell block. Evelyn runs her cell block the way she wants despite Benton's directives, and takes bribes from the charge with the most money to offer. Marie's time is rough, as she slowly learns that playing by the legitimate rules will get her nowhere, especially with Harper operating by her own sadistic rules. In addition, Marie is pregnant and has little to no support outside the prison walls to support her and her expanding family. Marie ultimately changes to a more hardened inmate after a series of events including her baby being taken away from her, the suicide of a fellow model inmate following a parole denial, and Marie's own parole denial for circumstances beyond her control. Marie changes for good after being placed in solitary confinement due to an altercation with Harper. Although Harper does eventually get her comeuppance, Marie decides, against the sage advice of lifer Millie Lewis, to take the most expedient way out by joining forces with the inmate with criminal connections on the outside. Despondent Benton knows that Marie will unfortunately be back behind bars.</p>
<p>Marie Allen is a 19 year-old innocent who is sent to the State penitentiary after becoming involved in a robbery staged by her now dead husband. She is two months pregnant and finds herself in the company of both petty and hardened criminals. With the help of a few inmates she quickly learns the inmate pecking order and takes the advice of the kindly prison Superintendent, Ruth Benton, to follow the rules and aim to get parole at the end of her first year. Her biggest obstacle is the matron in charge of her section, Evelyn Harper, an evil and sadistic overseer who goes out of her way to make everyone miserable. When her mother refuses to take care of her newborn child, it goes into State care and when she is refused parole, she hardens and is destined to a life of crime.</p>
<p>A naive nineteen year old widow becomes coarsened and cynical when she is sent to a woman's prison and is exposed to hardened criminals and sadistic guards.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film, of the genre, women in prison, or incarcerated.... is the best.. I cant understand why its not available on VHS or DVD !!!?? Brilliant performances  by  Eleanor Parker, Agnes Moorehead, and especially, Hope Emerson, as the prison matron... were all outstanding!! Parker & Emerson were Oscar nominated, and in a year (1950) which gave us, "All About Eve" , "Sunset Blvd", and others, that was no easy feat!!...Parkers beauty and innocence  gave the film its sensitivity & vulnerability...  Moorehead was  also outstanding (as always)  but  Emerson defined the role of prison matron.. forever!!.wow  what a monster....!!! what  a  performance.. !!watch for the lesbian moments as Emerson attempts to control the "girls" esp. Parker.. Nice moments by Gertrude Hoffmann (later Mrs Odettes in TVs "My Little Margie",) as the older inmate.... and the entire cast...  a gem... dont miss.... and please reissue on video......</p>
