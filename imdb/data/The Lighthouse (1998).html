<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having admired his previous movies, "Sol de otono" and "Cleopatra", by director Eduardo Mignogna, we decided to take a chance with "El Faro", a film that has been praised in this forum. The movie, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the praise, as some of the comments here give great emphasis to the fact that leading actress, Ingrid Rubio, received awards from her appearance in the film."El Faro" is not a horrible film, but the problem seems to be in the narrative that Mr. Mignogna employs for telling his story. The film is all over the place without making any solid points; the main story concentrates on the bonding of Meme and Aneta, the two surviving sisters from a tragic accident where they see their family die. Meme appears to be aimless throughout the film. Certain things aren't explained as they are left for the viewer's imagination. In a way, Meme is self-destructive as it appears that she is in a lot of pain with the injury in her leg.Ingrid Rubio and Jimena Baron are the best things in the movie. Both have a simple understanding as sisters should have. Roberto Darin, Norma Aleandro and the rest of the supporting cast don't have much to do.</p>
