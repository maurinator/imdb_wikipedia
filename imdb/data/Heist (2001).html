<h1>Heist (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David Mamet takes this story of thieves along many twists and turns, some of which work and some of which don't. Gene Hackman plays the brilliant leader of a gang (Delroy Lindo, Ricky Jay & Rebecca Pigeon as Hackman's youngish wife), which pulls off complex heists for a despicable fence (Danny DeVito). After stiffing the gang on a jewelry robbery, DeVito forces the gang to go after a Swiss gold shipment and to use his nephew (Sam Rockwell) in the crime. No one trusts anyone and every step is shaded with the unexpected.</p>
<p>A career jewel thief finds himself at tense odds with his longtime partner, a crime boss who sends his nephew to keep watch.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mamet did it again, when you are watching the movie you know that is a Mamet´s game, so you don´t know what you have to believe. Gene Hackman is like always perfect, and i didn´t know the sexy side of Rebecca Pidgeon, beautiful and erotic in this movie. Is a 10/10 film I recommend it to everybody who loves Hitchcock.</p>
