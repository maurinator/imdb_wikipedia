<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think "Scary Movie" is the best comedy movie ever made of all time. This movie made me laugh from beginning till the end.  I love it because the Wayans brothers.  They made a really funny movie.  It was better than "Don't Be A Menace..." I would definitely recommend this movie that enjoys a good laugh. A+ ******stars(out of ******) 100/100</p>
