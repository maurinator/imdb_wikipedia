<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie with my Dad in 1979.  In 1994 I ran my first marathon with my Dad and I think that was the first time I recalled seeing this movie. I have run four other marathons with him since and have been in an on and off again search of this movie for over 9 years.  It is nastalgic to me know and I am hoping someone is out there who can help me locate a copy.  Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
