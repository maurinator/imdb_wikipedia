<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>9\10 people in Israel will tell you that this movie is the best movie ever made by an Israeli. unfortunately this movie simply can't be understood by people who are not Israeli because the vibe of the movie is a comedy about the army in Israel, not just any army and about being Israeli. there are a lot of inside jokes that can only be understood by an Israeli and many different situations that you can't quite understand unless you've been in the same situation like most Israelies were when serving in the army. in Isarel its a cult movie and I doubt the fact that there are Israelies who have not seen this movie, it is broadcast every independent's day and probably once a month in the different channels. so I recommend you watch this film for the first time alone and on the second time with an Israeli that will tell you whats going on. 10\10 for me.</p>
