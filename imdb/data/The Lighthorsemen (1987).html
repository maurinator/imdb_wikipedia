<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Following the bloody debacle at Galipoli, an Aussie lighthorse brigade was given another "Mission Impossible;" they were to move across the waterless desert and attack a heavily armed Turkish post at Beersheba. These were infantry mounted on horseback and getting water was dependent on their success. Their adoption of cavalry tactics was an unexpected stroke. The final attack on Beersheba is worth the time spent watching the whole thing.</p>
