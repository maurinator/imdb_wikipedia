<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Was there ever such a vibrant, exciting music scene as that of the punk/new wave CBGBs explosion?Amos Poe has made history by capturing some of the leading lights of the genre in their natural performing habitat well before they hit the big time. Filmed on wonderful, grainy 16mm silent film savour the sights of luminaries such as Talking Heads, Wayne County, Patti Smith, Blondie, Tuff Darts, New York Dolls and the Ramones complemented with dubbed live tracks/demos to provide the soundtrack.Ironic, that on any punk compilation a track from all of the above artists features, and yet here they are all in the same place and possibly all on the same night. A treat for all punk/CBGB fans - Poe has really captured the wonderfully inventive, innovative and spontaneous atmosphere of the era here.Thanks Amos.</p>
