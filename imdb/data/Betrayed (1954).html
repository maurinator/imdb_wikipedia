<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As someone working on creative and interesting plotting, I saw this intrigue movie as outstanding. I had to stay and watch just to find out who the 2-way spy was: was it Turner, was it Mature, oh my could it be Clark? I had no problem with the directing; I thought the last scene with Turner looking at Gable, searching his face for signs of hate or love was good.I had a problem with the one word title, although it was relevant; it did seem to point to one character as the good guy, so it was misleading if that was the intent. (I don't think this is a spoiler, let me know). I was glad the movie was in color; usually I prefer black and white on the older movies, however, the scenery et all was great in color.</p>
