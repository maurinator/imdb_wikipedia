<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this ppv a lot it had 8 matches including the pre show match The show kicked off in its pre show with the usos defending the tag titles against rybaxel vs Los matadores vs the real Americans. Solid way to start off Wrestlemania some good spots could have been better but a good match, usos win 8/10The show started off with Hogan the Rock and Steve Austin all in the ring a cool moment for a wrestling fan The first match was Triple H vs Daniel Bryan winner moves into the main event, a great technical match. Some good spots but just an awesome match and ranks up there with one of the greatest matches. Daniel Bryan wins 10/10The Shield vs New Age Outlaws & Kane. Kind of a weird pairing if you ask me. I was excited for this match but lack of time hurt this match was about 4 minutes long, very disappointing. Shield Wins 5/10Next was the Andre the giant battle royal, not a bad battle royal, some cool spots like Cesaro recreating the Wrestlemania 3 moment when Hogan lifting Andre up and Cesaro throwing Big Show over the top rope and winning. 7/10Bray Wyatt vs John Cena, when I first heard that they would have this match a Mania I was very upset because Bray only had a handful of matches and most were not very good. The thing that helped this feud was Bray Wyatt's promos absolutely great promos. The match itself was kind of disappointing it took a long for it to pick up but when it did it wasn't bad a few good spots though. John Cena wins 7/10Brock Lesnar vs The Undertaker, this match for the time it had should have been match of the night, the match was good but I blame it all on the crowd, 70,000 people in the arena and it felt like you could hear a pin drop. I liked this match it was good but I wish the crowd was into it. Then out of no where Lesnar f5s Undertaker and wins. The biggest shock in pro wrestling History. 8/10Divas championship match Aj Lee vs all the divas. A good divas match had some good spots and was better than shield vs Outlaws and Kane. Winner Aj LeeNext the main event Daniel Bryan vs Randy Orton vs Batista for the WWE world heavyweight championship. A great main event had great spots like the Batista bomb and Rkp through the announce table. I thought Orton had it when he rko Batista closest near fall ever! A well deserved victory for Daniel Bryan and new WWE world heavyweight champion, hats off to him.All in all the good Wrestlemania had some great matches and some bad but not the worst and not the best Mania.Overall show 9/10</p>
