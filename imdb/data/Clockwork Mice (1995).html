<h1>Clockwork Mice (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A special needs education teacher is having a special relation with one of his pupils by their common hobby: running. Until fate strikes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A minor, understated classic with exceptional acting from the staff and a raw realism from the pupils. The story follows a teacher Steve (played brilliantly by Ian Hart) starting a new job at a Special needs school. He has to become accepted by the pupils as a teacher, but more than that, wants to reach the children as individuals. Steve discovers a common interest of cross-country running with Conrad, the pupil who's been there the longest. This common interest proves a good form of communication between the two to begin with, but goes on to unite the Children as well. Played with an underlying sense of humour, but for me the acting is what really makes this film work so well.</p>
