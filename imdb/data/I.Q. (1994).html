Fortunately, Catherine's uncle likes Ed, and with his friends they scheme to make Catherine fall for Ed.

<p>Albert Einstein helps a young man who's in love with Einstein's niece to catch her attention by pretending temporarily to be a great physicist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A genial romantic comedy, "I.Q" is a flirtatious piece of fluff in which an auto mechanic woos the educated daughter of ol' E=MC2 himself, Albert Einstein.  No guffaw inducer, but very pleasant fare given a considerable boost by its cast, most notably Matthau who is very good indeed as Mr. Einstein.</p>
