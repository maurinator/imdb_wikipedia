<h1>X the Unknown (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>British Army radiation drills at a remote Scottish base attract a subterranean, radioactive entity of unknown nature that vanishes, leaving two severely radiation-burned soldiers... and a "bottomless" crack in the earth. Others who meet the thing in the night suffer likewise, and with increasing severity; it seems to be able to "absorb" radiation from any source, growing bigger and bigger. What is it?? How do you destroy a thing that "feeds" on energy?</p>
<p>A radioactive, mud-like creature terrorizes a Scottish village.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Often overlooked even by those who enjoy the sci-fi films of the fifties, "X The Unknown" is one of those sleepers that real afficionados will watch over and over.   Starring Dean Jagger, the cast also features a very young Anthony Newly as a British Army corporal.There's not much that professional critics would find either amusing or compelling about this film, but when considered in its place as a landmark movie both for the sci-fi genre and for Hammer films, it shines somewhat brighter.As has aready been mentioned, this film occupies a prominent role among those that feature a "blob" monster.  The special effects, incidentally, are not bad for the year (1956), and the concept of a radioactive blob is perhaps even more interesting than one that merely gobbles up people.I understand that this was one of the early films produced by Hammer, as a step toward making more sci-fi entries.  I'm glad they took the chance.  This film and those that followed it enriched the genre for all fans of 1950's and 1960's sci-fi films.</p>
