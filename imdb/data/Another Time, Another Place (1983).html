<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw "Secrets and Lies" recently and, watching Phyllis Logan, was reminded of this little war-time story, a real gem of a kind that the English do so well. Set in the north of England, it concerns a liaison between a local girl and an Italian prisoner-of-war. The gentle romance; the knowledge that she will be subjected to the disapprobation of her family and the locals, adds to the build-up to the inevitable, sad, conclusion. It is a lovely story, shot in black and white, in bleak conditions, capturing the impossibility of a tender relationship, doomed by the circumstance of war. There must be a case for re-issuing these well acted TV dramas on DVD.</p>
