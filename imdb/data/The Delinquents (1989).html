<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just saw this film very recently, I don't know why I never saw it sooner. Kylie looks like she was just out of Neighbours and can really blow your socks off acting. I thought the way she transcended from girl to women was very effective.Charlie I knew from Diagnous Murder so I knew he could do comedy, but he played the love interest very well, and seemly thought out the character very well.The rest of the cast were superb I don't know they're work personally but they had me from the get go.The Mavis and Lyle Situation was lovely. Two people who knew what it felt for to be each others true loves.It was a great film and as much as I like Kylie as an entertainer, I would love to see her act again, maybe the roles reversed she being the strict one.Go and rent it out, it is a lovely thought out film.</p>
