<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Merrill's Marauders isn't the best WWII film by a long shot. However, it does have several things going for it.  Director Sam Fuller had plenty of army infantry service under his belt from his own WWII experiences.  That in itself makes it difficult to argue with his portrayal of the trials of Merrill's foot soldiers.  I notice this movie turns on the breaking point of the Marauders, especially how these American infantrymen transcended it in order to win.  this is a hallmark of the special forces tradition, but I think Fuller is less interested in the origins of the US special forces than in defining the qualities of physical and mental fortitude necessary for successful soldiers.  There is more than the stoicism of normal Hollywood heroes here, these characters do reach the end of their ropes, but fall in for another fight, time and again.  The other noticeable production element is the apparent use of active duty personnel as extras.  This shows in scenes like the assault on Wallabum, with the men charging in squad rushes (one of the best battle scenes of the movie).  Other parts of that same battle scene, and others,  aren't so impressive, but This flick isn't about the action. It is Fuller's biggest war production, if not quite his best, and while it may not be his best film, a close viewing may redeem the effort.</p>
