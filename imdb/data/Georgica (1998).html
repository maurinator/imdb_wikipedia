<p>Quiet Tarkovskian drama about an old man who lives alone on a deserted island which the Soviet fighter planes use for nighttime target practicing.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Soon after the Second World War a boy Maecenas had a psychological trauma and he can't speak anymore so he is sent for summer to the old man Jakub who is a bombing ground keeper on some deserted isle. Now only an old man, a boy, a horse and bees live on this empty island. When young the Jakub used to be a missionary in Africa so now he tries to offer some of his knowledge to the boy and also he's translating Virgil's Georgics into Swahili. While dark remembrances of the boy and lighter ones of the old man go before our eyes there is a friendship slowly growing between them. And no one may suppose that a tragedy lies in waiting in the nearest future. This profound, mighty drama is lyrically sad and full of reverberations from Virgil's bucolic poem.</p>
