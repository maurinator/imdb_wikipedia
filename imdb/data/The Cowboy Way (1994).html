<h1>The Cowboy Way (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Buddies Pepper Lewis (Woody Harrelson) and Sonny Gilstrap (Kiefer Sutherland) who are championship rodeo partners travel to New York to find their missing friend, Nacho Salazar Joaquín Martínez after he disappears in New York City to pick up his daughter, Theresa (Cara Buono). When Pepper and Sonny find that neither is anywhere to be found, they go about the wacky adventure of finding Nacho and Theresa, and in the process, test the foundation of their friendship. Along the way, they find themselves entwined in the inner workings of a New York sweat shop where Theresa has been enslaved after traveling to the U.S.A. from Cuba. Going about doing things in a cowboy way, Pepper and Sonny put their small town skills to the test in a big city kind of way and rescue Theresa from the thugs.</p>
<p>Sonny Gilstrap (Kiefer Sutherland) and Pepper Lewis (Woody Harrelson) are two cowboys from New Mexico who compete in rodeos, but their friendship's been strained when Pepper fails to show up at a major competition. They are fortunate that Sonny's cook, Nacho (Joaquín Martínez) acts as a buffer between them. After his peace making efforts fail, Nacho goes home, he then gets a phone call from someone telling him that his daughter, Teresa (Cara Buono) has just arrived in New York from Cuba. But the man tells him that he still has an unpaid balance, which of course he doesn't have. Nacho then leaves and goes to New York and leaves Sonny a note. When Sonny reads the note, he proceeds to follow him but he's broke, so he asks Pepper if he will loan him some; Pepper decides to go with him. The two bicker along the way. When they get there they get help from a New York Policeman, Sam Shaw (Ernie Hudson). They find Nacho in the morgue. All what's left for them to do is find Teresa.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sort of a buddy action film that's focal point is the rocky relationship between the two main protagonists (who just happen to be modern day cowboys) as they find out just how much they rely on each other. The friendship might consist largely of bickering between the two actors; Woody Harrelson (who mugs it up) and Kiefer Sutherland, but the combination naturally flows and their performances are truly fitting with amusing comical exchanges. And even heartfelt too. Two New Mexico rodeo cowboy friends (strained at that) Sonny and Pepper head to New York City to find a missing friend Nacho and his Cuban immigrant daughter Teresa. What they uncover is that Nacho had got himself in some serious trouble that seems him ending up in a morgue and his daughter working in a sweatshop. This Hollywood dross is something rather light-weight and blunt with a message to boot. Still rather enjoyable even with its sugar-coating and stereotypical traits. The script throws about priceless dialogues and sets up the situation with aplomb. These characters are right out their comfort zone, but go about getting the job done the cowboy way and going all out. Had me thinking of the 1968 feature "Coogan's Bluff". Atypical but amusing if a little a silly. Some good action set-pieces standout (namely the climatic chase) and you can't beat good dummy work. Flavoured country soundtrack finds its way in. The rest of the performances are acceptable with a likable Ernie Hudson as a horse riding New York cop and Dylan McDermott as the sly criminal behind Nacho's death. Also popping up are Tomas Milan, Marg Helgenberger, Cara Buono and Luis Guzman."You cowboys are a dying breed."</p>
