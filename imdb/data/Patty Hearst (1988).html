<h1>Patty Hearst (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The true story of a rich girl who was abducted by American revolutionaries in the 1970's. Her time spent with her captors made her question herself and her way of life and she joined forces with the cause that her abductors were fighting for. This created a US scandal and Patty Hearst has become a pop culture fixture.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The 19-year-old daughter of a U.S. newspaper magnate is kidnapped in the early 1970s by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing urban militant group peopled with self-styled revolutionaries and guerrilla fighters; after 57 days in captivity, she is given her choice to be freed or join up with the SLA--she joins. Interesting adaptation of Patricia Hearst's memoir "Every Secret Thing" co-authored with Alvin Moscow, given artistic treatment by director Paul Schrader, who is alternately straightforward, historically reverential, and sometimes pretentious. The film has no entertainment value whatsoever (and moves at a mercilessly slow pace), but does have strong acting and is useful as a vivid recreation of this chapter in time. ** from ****</p>
