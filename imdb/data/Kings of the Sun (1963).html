<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is terrific!. I liked its clever premise of the Mayan culture contacting the Plains Indian culture. The Kon Tiki and Ra voyages of Thor Heyerdahl proved that "primitive" peoples sailed amazingly far distances, so the Mayans reaching North America and meeting a North American tribe is quite feasible. The two cultures' contact was fascinating and involving. I saw this movie years ago, and then once or twice on broadcast television channels. I wish I could see it again! With all the wide variety of cable and satellite channels now available, I wish one of them would show The Kings Of The Sun.......  Or that it would become available on video or DVD.......</p>
