<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was stumped at the video store - had basically narrowed the DVD search down to 2 - Sphere (yeah, I know..) and Savior, this interesting looking title on the bottom shelf.Thank goodness I chose this one.What a brilliant, gut-wrenching, agonising movie...Other comments have said it was a low budget job, but the DVD version I just saw didn't even make you think about the mechanics of the movie - just the characters and events that this film portrayed.The cinematics - beautiful scenery etc (to show that man really has no sense at all - he can be surrounded by some of the most amazingly beautiful surroundings and still turn the place to hell) and sound (the gunshots / ambient stuff etc were very well done) were all spot on..For the actual plot, the other comments posted are a lot more lucid than mine, so I won't bother trying to explain the premise of this flick.I really don't know what else to say - some of the scenes containing brutality were brilliant (in a really horrible way) - none of the usual hollywood (tm) bad guy finally gets it in the end type stuff - cliche - it really just showed how pointless these kinds of conflicts are. clicheOh man - this film is going to stick with me for quite some time. And I kind of wish it didn't. I was after a throw away movie (should have rented sphere) and instead got this thing that I just cannot stop thinking about.Dennis Quaid was amazing in it, and the rest of the cast were excellent, too.And yes, I cryed like baby Vera..PS: I actually registered just so I could vote & comment on this movie..</p>
