<h1>The Carpetbaggers (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>George Peppard plays a hard-driven industrialist more than a little reminiscent of Howard Hughes. While he builds airplanes, directs movies and breaks hearts, his friends and lovers try to reach his human side, and find that it's an uphill battle. The film's title is a metaphor for self-promoting tycoons who perform quick financial takeovers, impose dictatorial controls for short-term profits, then move on to greener pastures.</p>
<p>Jonas Cord is a disagreeable rich young tycoon on the corporate make, with some subplots about booze, broads and Hollywood in the 1930's.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has got to be one of the finest fictionalized biographies ever presented. Obviously names and places may change, but the image of Howard Hughes shines through in the presentation of Jonas Cord, and the other characters included, or created for the development of this character. Obviously this speaks well of the writing of Harold Robbins, but it took the talents of George Peppard & co. to breathe into it the vibrant life that jumps off the screen into the consciousness of the viewer.Definitely not a movie to be missed by anyone who is a fan of Harold Robbins!</p>
