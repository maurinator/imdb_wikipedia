<h1>The Rebel Rousers (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a small, US costal town with many Spanish speakers, a motorcycle gang arrives on holiday. Also in town to try to reconnect with his pregnant girlfriend, Karen, is businessman Paul Collier. Paul and a leader of the cyclists, J.J., knew each other years before, so when the gang comes upon the couple and, led by the menacing Bunny, beats up Paul and begins a sexual assault of Karen, J.J. tries to intervene: he suggests they hold cycle-riding contests, with the winner claiming Karen (he promises, sotto voce, to set her free if he wins). After the contests commence, Paul crawls away to look for help. He meets with a shrug from a cowardly sheriff's deputy; where can he turn?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Rebel Rousers" is an obscure and cheaply made biker flick is one of the least exciting or action-packed entries into the genre. In fact, there's not really a lot of rumbling or anti-socializing going on. Fortunately, it has lots of nearly surreal moments of stupidity that make it rather entertaining, at least a lot more than I expected.The amazingly charisma free Cameron Mitchell goes with pregnant finance Laura Dern to a small desert town. He meets an old collage chum Bruce Dern, who is now in a biker gang (never mind the fact thats there's a roughly twenty year difference between the two actors). Among members of the gang are a pre-stardom Jack Nicholson (the flick was filmed in 1967, but not released until 1970 to capitalize on the success of "Easy Rider") and the great Harry Dean Stanton, playing the weirdest movie biker of all time. Seriously, the gang dresses more like The Monkees than The Hells Angels. The biker gang beats up Cameron Mitchell (seeing Jack Nicholson whip Mitchell is oddly satisfying for some reason) and kidnap Dern, all to the dismay of Dern, who wants a better life for his gang or something. Mitchell comes back to fight them eventually, armed with some locals from the town.The so-called "climax" is extremely disappointing. Mitchell and the town members find the biker gang, and proceed to do absolutely nothing. Stupid, pointless, and with some boring stretches (Mitchell and Dern talk about interior decorating for what seems like an hour), but oddly entertaining all the same because of how bizarre it can be at moments. Note, even though hes listed as the star on a lot of the video and DVD versions, Jack Nicholson is hardly in here nor is his character even remotely interesting. (5/10)</p>
