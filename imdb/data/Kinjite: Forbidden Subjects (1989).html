<h1>Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Tokyo businessman (Hiroshi Hada), transferred to L.A, molests a teenage girl on a train. It turns out that the girl is the daughter of a vice cop. But in one of those plot twists that can only occur in the movies, the cop is assigned to find the businessman's own daughter who has been kidnapped and forced into a teen prostitution ring.</p>
<p>A brutal Los Angeles police Lt. is determined to bust up an organization that forces underage girls into prostitution.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Repugnant Bronson thriller. Unfortunately, it's technically good and I gave it 4/10, but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it "entertainment". Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.</p>
