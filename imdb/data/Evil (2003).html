<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ondskan is a Swedish movie about a young man who despite being a smart student often gets in trouble with his bad conduct and reputation. So much so that he is soon expelled from school and is given little chance to have a good future. With the help of his mother he is given a last chance at graduating at an exclusive all male school. There he finds contrasting fortunes as he struggles against the cruel upperclassmen and finds friendship and love as he struggles to finish school. This movie was nominated for a Oscar for best Foreign Language film.I thought the actors did a great job in portraying their characters. Andreas Wilson did a great job as Erik as he went from a furious student being bullied to a softer Erik when it came to scenes with Marja. I thought he did a great job in the transformation fro his many personalities. Even more surprising is the fact that this film is actually his first movie. Also a menacing Gustaf Skarsgard did a great job in playing the big bully in the film.You could also in this film some very basic themes such as love, friendship and the constant battle of good versus evil. They were well crafted into the film and some of the scenes I thought were good enough to display these themes.</p>
