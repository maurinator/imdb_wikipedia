<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cute and comforting  that's how one can describe this movie. The kind of "cuteness" that 'Cinema Paradiso' or 'The spirit of the beehive' or 'The grand highway' presents you with.All-too-well-known characters, all-too-well-known days, but how much of a character resides beneath the surface? How much of a "special day" resides underneath a humdrum-'everyday'? - This movie is an authentic documentation of all our 'could-have-been' dreams of mundane 'everyday's. Doesn't matter if you are not a farmer in Switzerland, doesn't matter if you are not familiar with country life, you'll still be able to relate yourself perfectly with the main character, you'll still want to have your own small moped.The movie has a number of strong points, the best to me being, sense of restraint of director Yves Yersin. As a result of this pinpoint precision, despite an inviting subject matter, the movie never imposes abstractness on viewers. While it never drifts too away from reality, it doesn't dwell merely in the reality.  Not many films can be attributed with this rare quality.I recommend this movie strongly, it's a real gem.</p>
