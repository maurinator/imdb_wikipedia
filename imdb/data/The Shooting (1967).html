<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The thieves, rapists and murders outnumber the cops by 7-1, according to Jack Webb's opening narrative, which always talks about the city of Los Angeles and its population.This story has a more serious tone to it than most because a fellow cop is shot. It seems he just innocently went up to a car to check out something that looked suspicious when one of the two guys standing next to the car turned around, produced a shotgun, and blasted him. The cop survived but has no memory. A doctor in this episode mentions that often happens to people who suffer a traumatic experience. It's so bad their conscious does everything it can to suppress the bad memory. The cop in here said he doesn't know if he can tell anyone who the President is, his memory is so wiped out.That turns out to be the major problem of this story because Friday and Gannon can't find witnesses to the shooting. They finally get enough information to arrest the two guys, but how to they close the case? The two thugs, by the way, had some good, wise-guy film noir-type lines.</p>
