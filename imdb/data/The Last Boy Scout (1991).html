<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bruce Willis stars as Joe Hallenbeck, who was once a top of the line Secret Service agent but has since become an alcoholic, flea bag detective. While performing the chores of a two bit shamus, he discovers his wife Sarah (Chelsea Field) is having an affair with his best friend. Joe is hired to protect Cory (Halle Berry), a stripper who has been getting death threats; Joe begins to sober up when Cory is blow to smithereens. Cory's boyfriend, Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans), was at one time a NFL football quarterback, but was thrown out of the game for gambling and addiction to Demerol. Smelling something fishy, Joe and Jimmy begin to investigate further and discover layers of corruption in professional football circles, leading up to Sheldon Marcone (Noble Willingham), a corrupt team owner who wants to pay off legislators to legalize gambling on pro football games. The Last Boy Scout is one of the better action movies I have seen. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans make a good team in this film.</p>
