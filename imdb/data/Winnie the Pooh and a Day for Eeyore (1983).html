<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eeyore is gloomy, like always, but more so now. His birthday is right around the corner and everybody has forgotten. It didn't cheer him up any when Tigger "accidentally" knocks Eeyore into the river. Pooh invents a new game, "Pooh Sticks", and everyone contributes to Eeyore's party, there's flat balloons, storage honey pots with Owl's hand writing on them, and a game of Pooh Sticks which Tigger claims he likes, but immediately hates it because he lost. It turns out to be a happy birthday celebration after all.</p>
<p>Winnie the Pooh and friends decide to throw a birthday celebration for gloomy, old Eeyore.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This forth installment in Disney's Winnie the Pooh series of short is in many ways the most endearing and rewarding of the four.  The story revolves around Eyeore's forgotten birthday and Pooh and friends' attempts to make amends.  It rings true in its themes of isolation, desiring and achieving companionship, and true friendship.Thankfully, this short is available in the supplemental material on the DVD (2002 release, Region 1) edition of `The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'.  If you have this DVD, don't pass over this delightful extra.</p>
