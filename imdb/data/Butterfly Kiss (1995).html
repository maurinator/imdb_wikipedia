<h1>Butterfly Kiss (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eunice is walking along the highways of northern England from one filling station to another. She is searching for Judith, the woman, she says to be in love with. It's bad luck for the women at the cash desk not to be Judith, because Eunice is eccentric, angry and extreme dangerous. One day she meets Miriam, hard of hearing and a little ingenuous, who feels sympathy for Eunice and takes her home. Miriam is very impressed by Eunice's fierceness and willfulness and follows her on the search for Judith. Shocked by Eunice's cruelty she tries to make her a better person, but she looses ground herself.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Amanda Plummer continues her tradition of oddball and perfectly drawn characters in Butterfly Kiss.  In fact, her extended cameo in Pulp Fiction comes across as somewhat well balanced in contrast to her portrayal of this dented and damaged road weary dominatrix in search of a soulmate on one of Britain's anonymous northern roads.Thelma and Louise?  Well, yes, I suppose, but Butterfly Kiss has more in common with John Huston's little known masterpiece Wise Blood than with Ridley Scott's dust-borne epic of the great American Southwest.  There are two women in both movies--but Little Women is not Thelma and Louise cubed.There are some beautiful loose ends in this one.  Why is Plummer's character the way she is?  Where's she been?  How did this come about?  Adding to that is the fact that the accents are thick as steel padlocks and what you should have is a confusing mess.  Instead, Plummer pulls this off with such aplomb that you don't care about any of that.  What's she going to do next?  That's the real question in Butterfly Kiss, and you'll hang on just to find out.I loved this.  Rent it for a couple of days because you'll want to see it a couple of times before you're done with it.</p>
