<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Because of scoring exceptionally high on a statewide standardized exam and being an exceptionally good basketball player Jamal Wallace is sent to a prestigious prep school in Manhattan.

<p>Jamal Wallace is an inner-city kid from the Bronx who has an aptness at basketball and a genius at writing.

While Jamal is given a heavy load at his new school, both he and the school know that the real reason they took him on is for his prowess on the court. Befriended by fellow student Claire and helped along by Pulitzer-prize winning author and recluse William Forrester, Jamal pursues his dreams both on and off the court while overcoming obstacles placed by his bitter literature teacher. As Jamal is shaped by Forrester, he finds that he is changing the old writer as well, forcing him to confront his past...and his future.</p>
<p>A young writing prodigy finds a mentor in a reclusive author.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Comparisons will be made since Gus Van Sant directed both.  As there are similarities, there are also differences. I found that the main characters are dealing with social issues that are more specific to the world today.  In Hunting it was more specific to the characters.  Forrester's main characters stakes are more obvious where I thought in Hunting there were more subtleties.  Van Sant does an effective job at showing the different worlds at stake.  How New York is a Tale of Two Cities.  This is the kind of movie that should be shown in schools.  I believe there is social benefit to be gained. We are also introduced to a new actor that Van Sant discovered.  I think people will be amazed at how he naturally plays the part and opposite Connery's Forrester. I'm sure you will enjoy it; just try not to compare it too much.  Though, there is an obvious reason when you watch it.</p>
