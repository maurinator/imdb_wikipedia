<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tongue-in-cheek western that's better than it had any right to be. That's mainly because TCF went to the expense of filming in southwestern Colorado, arguably the state's most scenic part. Plus, the lead actors come through in vivid fashionÂ—a charmingly affable Dan Dailey, a spunkily convincing Anne Baxter, and those two grand old grouches Walter Brennan and Will Wright. And shouldn't overlook Chief Yowlachie as the superbly deadpan Indian manikin. Then too, the story's just wacky enough to separate from the oater pack. Seems a new railroad has to get to Tomahawk to qualify for an exclusive contract. Trouble is this would cause the stage line to go belly-up, so guess who's sabotaging the rail line's effort. And that's along with hostile Indians and 40 miles of missing track. Good thing toughie Baxter's along with her gunslinging skills, along with a pack train of sturdy horses.I love dad Wright's effort at explaining the birds and the bees to his flummoxed daughter Baxter. Too often the actress over-emoted in her parts, but not here. She's near perfect as the thoroughly virginal tomboy, that is, until the winning Dailey teaches her how to "buss". I guess my only reservation is with the Indian attack. It's much too conventional for a movie like this, and should have been finessed in slightly humorous fashion. Looks like it might have been included as a concession to audiences expecting something more traditional. Anyway, catch Marilyn Monroe in the fluffy yellow outfit among the four dancers getting a brief musical number. Overall, the elements come together in generally delightful fashion, making the movie something of a minor sleeper, thanks mainly to TCF's handsome budgeting and an outstanding cast.</p>
