<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. heads an all-star cast about the fever of politics, those running for office, and how those use others in their quest for getting what they want, no matter the cost. The film begins with a murder of a housewife, who's been straying. The district attorney, played by "Maverick" star Jack Kelly, has aspirations of running for Governor and means to get a conviction to help his chances of winning. Judge Efrem presides the case and has thoughts on running for governor as well. Senator Don Ameche even wants to be governor so he can stay in office while going back to his roots. The case gets very interesting quick, when the viewer knows more than they do - that they have the wrong man. They think the husband did it. For such a underrated film compared to Advise and Consent, this was a very well-made and enjoyable film, with a stellar cast, including also Angie Dickinson, who married Don Ameche, only because Efrem was already married. (She must have always loved him.) But when Efrem's wife died, she became more disenchanted with her marriage and filled with what if. Character actors Herbert Marshall and Jesse White costar, along with TV stars Parley Baer and Carroll O'Connor, in his movie debut. And the more I see of Efrem in movies, the more I like him; he always embodies the voice of reason and common sense. But more than that, he exudes a warmth not usually found in handsome leading actors. And he is still with us today, at the age of 95. A sign of a life well lived. "A Fever in the Blood" showcases good actors as politicians immersed in their worlds and being pitted against each other, all vying for the position of one. Who will be governor? Who deserves it? Watch and see for yourself.</p>
