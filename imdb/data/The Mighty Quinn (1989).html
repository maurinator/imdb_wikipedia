<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I never tire of watching this movie. It is one of my favorites, and a great showcase for Denzel Washington. He gets to be the cool-headed Chief of Police that takes no crap from the rich white folks and, at the same time, is the butt of jokes from his own people.The cast of characters all add to this interesting mystery set in Jamaica. Robert Townsend shows his amazing versatility as the childhood friend of Washington and the chief suspect in a murder. Mimi Rogers is just luscious as the philandering spouse of James Fox, the man who wants Washington to go away and stop doing his job. M. Emmet Walsh makes the perfect government hit man, who is after missing $10,000 bills. Then, there is Sheryl Lee Ralph as Washington's wife. When she sings "(I'm) Hurting Inside," you know it's true. Then she sings the title song as a dig at her husband. But, the whole film has a continuous soundtrack of fantastic music that adds island charm to the laughs and seduction and fun.It is the next best thing to a trip to Jamaica.</p>
