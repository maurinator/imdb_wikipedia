He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However, he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year, Munna's parents come to see their "doctor" son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctors/patient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father, Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter, emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie, I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly, there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh, some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene, Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station, the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents. You're just 15 minutes into the film and you're laughing out loud. The sequences in the hospital only get funnier.The film is a comedy but does not shy of trying to touch your emotions and it succeeds big time. Sunil Dutt confronting his son is heartbreaking to watch. Sanju's scenes with Jimmy Shergill is brilliant.The music is situational so it isn't conventional in any way. Although, the songs are different, they're good for the most part. The title song, Dekh Le, Chan Chan etc all go well with the screenplay and are soothing to the ears. There may not be a chartbuster in the soundtrack but the songs are still good.The writing is just brilliant. No loop-holes in the script. No dip in the screenplay. Characters are fully developed. Raju Hirani's story is fresh.Another highpoint - Abbas Tyrewala's dialogues. Just outrageous. They are funny, and not a bit over the top. The emotion filled dialogues are perfect too.Gracy Singh, Jimmy Shergill, Krush Debo etc all lend great support. It was a pleasure watching Sunil Dutt with Sanju.Baman Irani is a great talent and I'm sure he would agree with me that this movie boosted his acting career. He's hilarious. A brilliant act! Murli Prasad Sharma would not be what he is without his side-kick Circuit, played by Arshad Warsi. Arshad is a scene stealer. His best act yet. This role was a turning point for Arshad.Now to Sanjay Dutt. Before Munnabhia, Sanju was doing mediocre movies and mediocre roles. He hadn't give a box office hit in ages. Munnabhi MBBS is Sanjay Dutt's role. He was born to play the character and nobody can do it better than him. Not SRK, not Aamir - NOBODY! Although these people mentioned above are a huge part of the movie, none of them deserve more credit than the real hero of this masterpiece.Before naming him, I'd like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for finding this guy. Yes, I'm talking about Indian cinema's current best filmmaker Raj Kumar Hirani.This is Raju's film and no one can deny it. A perfectly directed movie and a novel idea. Hats off to this guy, who gave 2 more classics after this movie. (Lage Raho Munnabhai & 3 Idiots) What is there left to say? Just watch it, enjoy it, and watch it again. (I know you will!)</p>
