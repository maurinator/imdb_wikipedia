<h1>Southern Comfort (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Southern Comfort documents the final year in the life of Robert Eads, a transgender man. Eads, diagnosed with ovarian cancer, was turned down for treatment by two dozen doctors out of fear that treating such a patient would hurt their reputations. By the time Eads received treatment, the cancer was too advanced to save his life. Filmmaker Kate Davis follows Robert and a group of transgender Southerners in this captivating and truly touching documentary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This documentary has won many awards and I can see why. This is one of the best documentaries that I have ever seen. It is about a trans-gender from a woman to man named Robert Eads. This takes place in rural Toccoa, Georgia where Robert resides in a trailer. Because of prejudice and hate, the doctors refuse to treat Robert's ovarian cancer, which develop in his existing ovaries. He finds comfort in his trans-gender girlfriend Lola Cola and attends his last Southern Comfort conference. This film taught me a lot about diversity and how it is at times disregarded in this country. This made me open my eyes and stand up for the minorities of this country. I hope that the people who view this will get the same feeling whenever they view this documentary</p>
