<h1>Fate Is the Hunter (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Airliner crashes near Los Angeles due to unusual string of coincidences. Stewardess, who is sole survivor, joins airline executives in discovering the causes of the crash.</p>
<p>After a Consolidated Airlines flight crashes resulting in the deaths of 57 passengers and crew, those on the ground try to piece it all together. What is known is that the pilot, Jack Savage, reported a fire in their right engine but then the flight suddenly lost communications with the airport. One survivor, stewardess Martha Webster, tells them that the left engine also caught fire moments after the communications break but a test of the wreckage shows that the engine was in perfect working order. The investigation attributes the crash to pilot error. Savage had something of a playboy reputation and was reportedly seen drinking just a few hours before flight time. The airline's director of operations, Sam McBane, knew Savage well as they flew together in World War II and refuses to accept the verdict. As he does his own research, he sees a completely different side of Savage that dispels the myths around the man. He convinces the airline to allow them to recreate the flight which delivers the solution to the mystery.</p>
<p>Airline executive Sam McBane goes out on a limb to try and prove that a major crash wasn't the fault of his pilot friend, even though it may jeopodise his chances of promotion to Vice President.</p>
<p>A man refuses to believe that pilot error caused a fatal crash, and persists in looking for another reason.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this movie, not because 53 people died in a plane crash, but because through a determined investigation the cause was found and hopefully that same mistake won't happen again.   Strangely Dorothy Malone who was terriffic was unbilled.    Also, even though it starts out with the credits "A Cinemascope Movie" it is not shown that way even on my premium channel so I did not get to see the entire picture which is maddening.   It will be much more enjoyed if you can see it in the proper aspect ratio of 2.35 to l.</p>
