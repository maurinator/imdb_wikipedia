<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It is the year 2029: Astronaut Leo Davidson boards a pod cruiser on a Space Station for a "routine" reconnaissance mission. But an abrupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade and his most trusted warrior Attar. Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to its future.</p>
<p>An astronaut trying to retrieve a monkey in space ends up landing on a planet inhabited by talking human-like apes. Leo Davidson finds himself captured by the apes and placed in a cage with other humans. All the apes take this same 'human hating' attitude, with the exception of one. A kind, female ape called Ari sees something different in these humans, and plans to help them in whatever they need to do.</p>
<p>An Air Force astronaut crash lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominate a race of primitive humans.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Don't expect high drama or Shakespearean quality dialog. There's lots of good action sequences, great special effects, and some nifty science fiction geek concepts (even if the pseudo science is a bit inconsistent).The story isn't bad, has a couple of interesting twists on the original.Any movie that features humans + animals tugs the heart strings a little too.My only problem is that it really calls out for a sequel.My advice: don't take it too seriously and you might quite enjoy it.</p>
