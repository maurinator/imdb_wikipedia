<h1>The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Villa Fiorita is set on the banks of an Italian lake. The battle is for the mother of 2 children who having fallen in love with an Italian composer and concert pianist leaves her husband to go and live with him in his lakeside villa. Her children however follow her there from the UK and gang-up with her lover's daughter to try & get their mother back.</p>
<p>Based on a novel of the same name by Rumer Godden, this story centers around a British woman, Moira Clavering, who falls in love with a visiting Italian pianist, Lorenzo Tasara. Moira leaves her neglectful husband and two children and moves to Italy to start a life with Lorenzo. Her two children journey to their mother's new home, the Villa Fiorita, where they team up with Lorenzo's daughter to try to break up the couple.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked the movie mainly for the picturesque views of the lake,( Lake Como?) the surrounding area, and scenes of the villa itself. So much of the architectural style is remincient of the paintings done by Maxfield Parrish in the early part of the 20th century. You sort of have to look around the actors in the various scenes to get glimpses of ornate retaining walls, stairs and elaborate ballusters around and into the lake. There is an elegance about marble (or granite, or just old concrete?) stairs going down into the water. And old world gardens full of flowers. Itn reminds me of the book "Italian Villas and their Gardens" by Edith Wharton, 1907, Which was illustrated by Parrish. And yes, the children in the movie steal the show; All three have a much stronger determination to achieve their goals than do any of the adults. It's a good story line , dated for the sixties.  And is'nt this Olivia Hussey's first feature film?</p>
