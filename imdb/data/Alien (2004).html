<h1>Alien (2004)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Near a backwoods Ontario small town, a young alien, on vacation, crashes in his ship. Disoriented, this confused young extraterrestrial is captured by a young boy who, after naming him Phil, introduces him to the stupor of hard liquor before the boy's hick father throws him out. Roaring drunk and bunking with a friendly talking beaver, Phil eventually wanders into a bar where his new addiction traps him even while he wants to go home. Meanwhile, a secret US black ops organization activates a drunken field agent to find the alien. However, while he searches, Phil's easily manipulated personality leads him down paths that profoundly affect his new native friends.</p>
<p>An innocent human like alien crashes to Earth and find himself alone in the wilds of northern Canada, and then manipulated by the people he meets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a good film, and despite other reviewers stating that it "looked like a Canadian film" - it wasn't all that bad. We're not talking Beachcombers bad, we're talking "rather than buy props for one scene, the crew bought beer." The latex prop aliens and the CGI aren't all that bad. It's not huge on production values, but it's funny, and it has a TALKING BEAVER who can shoot a rifle; That alone is reason to see this. The loyalty scene with the puppies; the evil genius with the pet whales rather than the pet cat you'd be more likely to see in the hands of more serious evil geniuses; the Kill Me! alien in the glass bubble; what more could you want? Hell, there's even underage drinking and sex. It's quite possibly the perfect movie.</p>
