<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Candy does not do an extremely good job here. This film is one that was made to be forgotten. It is dull and slow. It takes about a half hour to finally get into the main theme of the film and it is still very slow until the final half hour. That is mainly when the horror elements and murders begin to take place. The only reason to see this film is because it stars John Candy. He does an okay job of acting, I guess, but the story itself does little to hold your interest. It bores you and indulges you with a hard to follow story of characters that all seem to turn on each other for no apparent reason in the end. Now, this film is really, really slow and could put the world's biggest insomniac to sleep. But, the final parts of the movie are worth waiting for. See this film if you are a John Candy fan. THE CLOWN MURDERS: 3/5.</p>
