<h1>Strawberry Fields (1997)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is startling...by denoting the typical asian american stereotypes, and showing the emotion and history of asian history. It's important to watch this film in order to see what it's like to try to identify with a culture. And the role the past has with dealing with the present and the future. this was a great movie, incendary at best. watch and you'll understand. The director also did a fine job at showing the turmoil within the angst filled teen and her mother and its manifestation.</p>
