<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Louie Kritski (Joe Pesci) is a money-grubbing heartless NYC slumlord who learned it from his father Big Lou (Vincent Gardenia). Housing authorities lawyer Naomi Bensinger prosecutes him. He is sentenced to bring his building up to code and forced to stay in an apartment in his building for 120 days. Louie has to stay in the building and Big Lou commands him not to fix one single thing.The movie is pretty bad and it has to do with Joe Pesci. He's a good comic relief sidekick as this annoying character. Usually the lead characters can show solidarity with the audience and ridicule Pesci. The whole movie is ridiculous and unreal. The slums have no real problems because all of the tenants are saints. Louie cluelessly leaves his expensive car parked in the ghetto. For such a crass person, he is also completely naive. Pesci is aggressively annoying. Of course, he learns the expected heart warming lesson but what else is there?</p>
