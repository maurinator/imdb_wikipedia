<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mel Gibson,  Glenn Close, Helena Bonham Carter make this a great version of Hamlet.  The camerawork is very intimate- especially the scene where Hamlet confronts his mother in the bedroom.  I could almost feel their breath, and when Hamlet holds the skull of Yorick.  I wanted to check this one out because a new Hamlet with Ethan Hawke is coming out this summer.  This was a very energetic version of Hamlet- I think I understood the Danes madness with Gibson's interpretation.</p>
