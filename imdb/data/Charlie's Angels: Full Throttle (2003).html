<h1>Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Angels--Natalie, Dylan, and Alex are back again but this time they're preparing for a strike without even warning as they go undercover to retrieve two missing silver bands. These are no ordinary rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveal the new identities of every person in the Federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start turning up dead, only the Angels, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts can stop the perpetrator, a mysterious "fallen" Angel. Aided by their trusty colleague, Jimmy Bosley, the Angels' adventure begins at a remote Mongolian outpost and ends only after Dylan is forced to face a dark secret from her past--a secret that puts the lives of her two best friends in danger.</p>
<p>Charles Townsend sends the Angels to investigate a series of murders following the theft of information from the government's witness protection program, and they find it the work of Madison Lee, a former member of Townsend's investigative service who holds a lethal grudge against the Angels. When the Angels barely escape the guns of Madison they must set a trap by setting up an FBI sting during a movie premiere, a setup that smokes out Madison.</p>
<p>Natalie, Dylan, and Alex, three glamorous, tough-as-nails, investigative agents - who work for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency - are sent undercover to retrieve two missing jewelry bands.

After five of the program's participants turn up dead, only the Angels can stop the perpetrator, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts.</p>
<p>The Angels investigate a series of murders which occur after the theft of a witness protection profile database.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw Charlie's Angels Full Throttle today -- it was an insult to the original! While Diaz, Liu and Barrymore are sexy women,  none of them holds a candle to a classic like Farrah Fawcett.The movie was one situation after another that put them in ridiculous costumes and weird sexual innuendo. Correction: BAD weird sexual innuendo. And Demi Moore as the angel-turned-bad?  Blah! Again, a sexy woman, but substandard acting: her performance was flat and passionless. As for the fight scenes:  the martial arts were HORRIBLE! It was a badly choreographed computer-generated matrix-esque MESS! Incidentally, I never went to see Charlies Angels in the theater because the previews made it look so corny -- and even they didn't do justice to the depths of corniness of this atrocity! The ONLY nifty part of the movie -- the anti-angel solo (Moore) had two golden DesertEagle50s! *droooooooooooooool* Now THOSE were cool!</p>
