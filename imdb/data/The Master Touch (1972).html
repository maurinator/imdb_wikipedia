<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It surprises me that for my 1st review, I would be moved to write a piece on this movie. I bought it for $1.99 at the local DVD store just because of the cover featuring Kirk Douglas as the star. What moved him to do this movie at this stage of his career would be interesting to know. In any event, I really enjoyed this movie a great deal. It had a car chase that rivals two of my favorites of all time in Bullit and the French Connection. It had the most realistic fight scenes I can remember seeing. The heist was elaborately thought out befitting the USA title of The Master Touch. It had a great twist at the end. A very good musical score composed by one of my favorites of all time by Ennino Moricone. Finally, It even had what I felt was a moral message to pass on at the end. Unfortunately, it also had a couple of big negatives that would perhaps bother a number of viewers. The quality of the DVD transfer is poor. Also, except for Kirk, the performer's lines are dubbed in English.All in all however, I enjoyed this movie tremendously and feel like I uncovered an unknown gem which for movie lovers provides a great satisfaction in itself.</p>
