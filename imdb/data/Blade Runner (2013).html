<h1>Blade Runner (2013)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short animation does an excellent job re-imagining Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" as a 40s film noir, condensing the plot in just one minute, without feeling rushed or scarce disregard of its brevity.It had a neat animation style, with a more than decent use of CGI and an excellent atmosphere, making a very good homage to all those classic detective movies. Personally, I appreciate the stuff that goes directly to the point instead of including padding or filler material, and this short, abridged version of "Blade Runner" shows that could be done in an elegant and interesting manner.8/10</p>
