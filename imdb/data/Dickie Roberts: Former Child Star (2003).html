<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have just finished seeing this film and it was hilarious! This truly a funny film with a heart. David Spade is at his best here protraying Dickie Roberts,a former child star,who wants so desperately to get back into the spotlight! I was suprized how the film,although funny,had a bit of sadness to it.We get to understand what these young stars,who grew up in a hollywood dreamland,go through. The love that was once there is now gone. There are some cool gems in this film that Spade and Company use flawlessly to make this flick a real winner in my opinion. All in all, it is worth the money I forked out for it!No regrets. In fact,I'm going to see it again! Go see it.It's a very entertaining film! p.s.Some of the scenes are filmed right here in MOnrovia,CA!!! It was surreal,almost,being in the movie theater and seeing it up screen at the same time!! Waaay COOOOL!!!</p>
