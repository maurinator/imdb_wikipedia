<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Smothers stars as the brave mountie, who along with his trusty horse and bitter deputy Paul Reubens must track down a killer who is stalking coeds at a nearby cheerleader camp.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very clever comedy.Tommy Smothers has made a couple of unusual comedies, and this is one. The other is 'Get To Know Your Rabbit' where Orson Welles himself gets into the act.'Pandemonium' is an excellent spoof of the slasher films that got too numerous to count.Carol Kane is wonderful as the girl who's "finally going to get to use my diaphram". I think this is the first film in which I ever saw Judge Reinhold. Paul Reubens could hardly be better.Give 'Pandemonium' a chance and you won't regret it.</p>
