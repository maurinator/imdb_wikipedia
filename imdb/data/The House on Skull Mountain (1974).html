<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this maybe BECAUSE it is so lame. Victor French as Dr. Andrew Cunnigham and Janee Michelle as Lorena Christophe were actually pretty good in their roles. They seem like they are good at their craft, in spite of the silliness of the movie and it's implausible premise. The other folks in the movie had a lot to overcome with the trite lines they were given. At the beginning of the film there is a scene where two of the "heirs" are on a winding mountain road in separate cars on their way to the house (you know---the one on SKULL HILL!). The info about the movie says the house is located in mountains on the outskirts of Atlanta, GA. Right. It was obviously filmed on the Pacific Coast, which is even more "un-voodoo-like" than Atlanta. The terrain, trees and vegetation made the Atlanta location totally unbelievable. And the music! Over-dramatic and hysterical. It's a good movie to watch on a night when your boyfriend is out of town. You can watch it alone and still turn out the lights without being creeped out. I get tired of all the gore in movies today, so this movie at least seems kind of like less of an assault to the senses and kind of harmless. But it still leaves me wondering... How can a movie be so BAD and yet still kind of charming in its own way?</p>
