<h1>The Specials (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>America's 7th Best Superhero Team, the Specials, are a group of geeks and oddballs. We get to see one day in their lives as fan and new member Nightbird joins the group, just in time for the group to get a new line of action figures. But the members' extreme personalities and personal issues threaten to rip the group apart.</p>
<p>The Specials, the sixth or seventh greatest superhero group in the world, count the geeks and the oddballs among their fans. They don't have the prestige or the money that a group like the Crusaders has. But they've found their niche as the Ringo Starr of superhero teams. There's the Weevil, the most popular member and the one pursued by other teams; the blue-skinned, foul-mouthed Amok; Minute (My-noot) Man, who is sensitive about his oft-mispronounced name; the ever-sneering Deadly Girl; the naive and boyish U.S. Bill; the Strobe, the leader of the team; the Strobe's wife, Ms. Indestructible, who is having an affair with the Weevil; the irritatingly perky Power Chick; the green-skinned weirdo, Alien Orphan; the fat and pompous Mr. Smart; and Eight, who has eight different bodies. The new member is a longtime fan who calls herself Nightbird. Unfortunately, she joins just when Cosgrove Toys creates a new line of action figures based on the Specials. The company's disastrous press conference could mean the end to this cut-rate super-group.</p>
<p>The sixth or seventh best superhero team in the world pursue their rightful place in the harshly competitive world of toy tie-ins and fighting evil.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This low-budget improvement on Mystery Men is about real people with slightly unreal abilities that don't save them from personal problems you'll recognize.  What saves them is each other.  As a bunch of misfits with only their very mild "super" powers and illusions(?) about fighting evil to bind them, this bunch of pretty much ordinary folks is doing the best it can.  You see nothing, really, of their comic-book abilities.  Instead, we see how they deal with the notion that they have something to contribute to a world that doesn't really appreciate them as it should.  Which, I dare say, will reach a lot of the intended audience of this film.I can't quite explain why, but the close-up look at mostly banal daily problems affecting these earnest do-gooders was heartening.  They mean well, even if they can't quite cope any better than the rest of us.  That's something we all wish we could say about ourselves, and know it was true.  For this bunch, it is true and, deep inside, they do know it.  That's, maybe, what actually makes them special.  Their lives are a mix of joy and sorrow, victory and defeat, humor and despair.  They are probably more fun to watch than to be, but if there were a bunch like this operating in my town, I'd want to join.</p>
