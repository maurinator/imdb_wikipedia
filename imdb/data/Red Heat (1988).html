<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Man-mountain Ah-nuld Schwarzenegger plays a Russian cop (Captain Danko) sent to Chicago to track down and deal with a nefarious drug dealer (played by Ed O'Ross who is all sweaty, unshaven bad guy). It's personal, it's gonna get ballistic and it's all made more entertaining by the fact that he's paired up with James Belushi back when James Belushi was still pretty funny.Ahhhhh, it's easy to slip on those glasses with the slightly rose tint and praise this as a modern action classic the way they used to make 'em. And the fact is . . . . . . it IS.The set-up is simplicity itself, there aren't really any twists and turns to tax your brain, Walter Hill directs the action assuredly and all the fun is to be had from watching Ah-nuld and Belushi wreak havoc as they try to bring the bad guys to task.Throw in a supporting cast that includes Peter Boyle as the standard put-upon boss, Larry Fishburne (before he was Lawrence), Gina Gershon and the magnificent Brion James (R.I.P) in a small but memorable scene and you have guaranteed good times for those wanting a testosterone-fuelled action movie with some amusing lines thrown in every so often.Not the funniest comedy or the best action movie, not even the best movie featuring either of the leads, but undemanding fun from the late 80s with rampant carnage that will inevitably lead to a considerable amount of paperwork (ref: Hot Fuzz, oh yes).See this if you like: Hot Fuzz, Lethal Weapon 3, Commando.</p>
