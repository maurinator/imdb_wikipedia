<h1>3000 Miles to Graceland (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It was an ingenious enough plan: rob the Riviera Casino's count room during an Elvis impersonator convention. But Thomas Murphy decided to keep all the money for himself and shot all his partners, including recently-freed ex-con Michael Zane. With $3.2 million at stake, the Marshals Service closing in, and single mom Cybil Waingrow and her son Jesse constantly confounding things, Michael must track down Murphy.</p>
<p>Hardened criminals Thomas J. Murphy and Michael Zane lead a gang of five using an Elvis impersonators convention as cover to violently rob the Riviera Casino. The others get eliminated either during the heist or infighting (allegedly?) over the way to divide the loot and launder it. Zane returns to the desert rat hole 'last Chance' sleazy diner run by divorced Cybil Waingrow, who makes a second income of seducing and robbing men with and for her smart cheeky rascal Jesse. Once she knows about the laundering, Cybil dumps Jesse of Zane so she can try to steal it, but Murphy, who already left a bloody trail including dead cops, recruits a new team, just like the police. Fortunes and betrayal keep shifting while the victims pile up.</p>
<p>"He who has the gun makes the rules" the golden rule of Murphy that he follows to eliminate the members of the gang he lead to rob a casino. But one man evades the gun and holds the money, Michael. Caught between Michael and Murphy is Cybil and her son Jesse. With the Marshals on their trail, both come up with escape plans.</p>
<p>A gang of ex-cons rob a casino during Elvis convention week.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After hearing a lot of bad reports on this movie I was pleasantly surprised when I finally saw it.  The acting is good, Kevin Costner's bad guy is great, it's well filmed with a lot of excellent cinematography, combined with absolutely perfect use of the soundtrack from minor audio cues right through to the explosions.  This is not a sophisticated movie, but in its genre it is excellent.</p>
