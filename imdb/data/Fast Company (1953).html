<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a pretty good comedy drama about how Polly Bergen inherited one horse, had all the smart guys in racing take her for a sucker but still managed to triumph -- at least to the extent of snaring Howard Keel.Polly Bergen is a little too one-note in her role, one that seems to have been tailor-made for Jane Wyman -- but that was another studio. Howard Keel is wonderful in his laid back role, which seems to have been written for Clark Gable. There's an excellent supporting cast, including Nina Foch -- who is a wonderful scene stealer here -- and Marjorie Main and John Sturges shows a good command of his cast and crew, moving surefootedly from comedy to drama.The issue with the film is that it's all a little too familiar, both the polite love triangle and the horse story. It all results in a pleasant waste of time.</p>
