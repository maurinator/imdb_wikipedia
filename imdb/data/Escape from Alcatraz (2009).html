<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Real Story: Escape from Alcatraz (2009) *** (out of 4)ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ is one of Clint Eastwood's best and most popular films but how close was it to the truth? "The Real Story" is a series that takes movies and shows the viewer what really happened. You'd have to have been living under a rock not to know the Alcatraz story but three men managed to escape the prison and make it to the waters of the San Francisco Bay but what happened after has always been a mystery. I think most people feel that all three were killed in their attempt to reach land and for the most part this documentary backs up that by having some trained experts try to make the voyage across the water and they can hardly do it with the professional equipment. The documentary has some great interviews with actual prison guards who were working when this event took place and there's also a re-enactment of the fourth member of the escape team who didn't go with the men. If you're a fan of the series or just the film then this here should at least keep you entertained, although there are certainly more detailed films out there.</p>
