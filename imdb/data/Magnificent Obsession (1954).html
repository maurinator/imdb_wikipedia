<h1>Magnificent Obsession (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When churlish, spoiled rich man Bob Merrick foolishly wrecks his speed boat, the rescue team resuscitates him with equipment that's therefore unavailable to aid a local hero, Dr. Wayne Phillips, who dies as a result. Phillips had helped many people, and when Merrick learns Phillips' secret, to give selflessly and in secret, he tries it in a ham-handed way. The result further alienates Phillips' widow, Helen, with whom Merrick has fallen in love. Merrick's persistence causes another tragedy, and he must remake his life, including going back to medical school, in an attempt to make amends and win her love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jane Wyman is stiff and motionless both before and after becoming blind. She reacts to bad news as though someone has just told her the morning paper has been mislaid. She seems so much older than Rock Hudson that the love interest between them is unbelievable and seems silly. I thought she seems old enough to be his mother. Why do blind people in movies not recognize the voice of someone known prior to blindness? This also makes the story unbelievable. There is much music, mostly Chopin, in the background (coming to the foreground frequently). Rock Hudson's car is one of the most interesting items in this movie. A blind person would surely recognize the sound, smell, feel of a car like this! Based on this car and Hudson's valiant work to carry this movie, I give this a 5 star rating.</p>
