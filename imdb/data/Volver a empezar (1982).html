<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great movie, watching it again with family thats visiting from El Salvador as i write this review. The movie is a timeless classic. The numerous poems and stories told as the movie unfolds give it a timeless feeling. This is my 5th viewing it never loses it magic I purchased a VHS copy and paid to have it converted to DVD. Well worth the $100.00 bucks to buy it, get it shipped and have in converted to DVD. Love this movie.My mother in law and sister in law haven't spoken a word since the movie started...</p>
