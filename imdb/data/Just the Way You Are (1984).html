<h1>Just the Way You Are (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Susan is a young, beautiful and successful flute player, but because of her physical handicap, a lame leg, she is having difficulties finding Mr. Right. While on tour in France, she decides to spend a few days on a ski resort wearing a fake cast around her lame leg to make sure her handicap goes unnoticed. Once arrived, she meets Peter, a handsome photographer...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A crippled musican with a leg brace takes a trip to France with her leg in a cast to see what people will treat her like when they don't know she is handicapped. A very appealing film and Kristy MacNichol has never been so likeable. An underrated classic. One of my favorite films of all time. Enjoy 9 out of 10.</p>
