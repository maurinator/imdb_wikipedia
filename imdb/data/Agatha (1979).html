<h1>Agatha (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A fictional account of the real life, eleven day, never explained 1926 disappearance of famed murder mystery writer Agatha Christie is presented. On a cold winter day, her damaged car with her expensive fur coat is found abandoned at the side of a country road. While the authorities initially suspect that she could have committed suicide, her pompous husband, Col. Archibald Christie, who is less than cooperative with the authorities, is adamant that she is still alive. What he doesn't tell them is that he recently asked her for a divorce so that he could marry his secretary, Miss Nancy Neele. Although the divorce request was not a total surprise since she knew of the extramarital affair, Mrs. Christie still did not want to grant him the request since she still loves him. Concurrently, American newspaper columnist Wally Stanton was scheduled to conduct an interview with Mrs. Christie. Since he can no longer do so with her disappearance, Stanton instead tries to find out himself what happened to her. He manages to track her to a resort spa hotel in Harrogate, she who is living openly there but under an assumed name, and he who does not disclose his own identity to her when he meets her. Stanton's goal is not only to find out what she is up to, but to protect her good name which means not allowing the authorities to find her before he uncovers her motives. Stanton's own motives end up being more than just wanting an exclusive story.</p>
<p>The movie starts when Agatha Christie's husband tells her he wants a divorce, as he fell in love with his secretary, Nancy Neele, and wants to marry her. Agatha pleads for him to stay with her, to no avail. She is very upset and drives away in the dark, swerves to avoid a dog on the road and plants her vehicle against a tree. In the morning her car is found, empty, and a massive search is initiated by the police. Rumors galore, the affair of the husband is common knowledge: the wife is always the last to know. Agatha shows up incognito at the Royal Bath passing through Harrogate station. It so happens that a famous American author is in the country who is somewhat of a detective himself; he tracks Agatha down at the spa, checks in at the same hotel and pursues her, as a suitor. Agatha, now calling herself Theresa Neele, is not interested as she is still in love with her husband. It seems too much of a coincidence when the competition, Nancy Neele, apparently also is taking in the baths. An Agatha Christie worthy story develops when people go about their way in mysterious ways and the suspicion is raised that a dead body might turn up after all, but who will it be? This is a charming movie that portrays Christie as a vulnerable and rather awkward author in a traditional marriage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fie on all adulterers!!!!  Vanessa makes you feel her pain as she is rejected by her handsome cold husband and then subjected to his lies about his new mistress.  We follow her thought processes, so good is her acting, as she mulls over suicide and the various ways it may be accomplished.  Her masochistic love for this man is hard to believe, unless you've been caught up in the spell of a @#$$^$*%()_ , know what I mean?  She certainly doesn't need him, financially.Anyway, Dustin Hoffman comes along playing a hard-eyed, confident newspaper man, quite against type.  He meets the wealthy owner of the paper he's stringing for eye to eye with great firmness.  The way he brings another reporter into some high faluting meeting place over the snobbish insults of the wait-staff is a beautiful and subtle thing to watch.I of course enjoyed all the English scenery at Bath, England at the old hotel there meant for folks in the old days to take different 'cures'.  Of course, we're talking the idle rich here, and it was rather fascinating since we have our own Warm Springs, also used for similar type cures during the 30s and 40s.Buy the movie for your big screen TV, and back it up with some Merchant Ivory for a great evening of hoighty-toighty England.</p>
