<h1>The Monster (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A vicious serial sex killer is on the loose, and landscape gardener and shop-window outfitter Loris is the prime suspect, thanks to his unfortunate habit of getting caught in compromising situations (for which there is always a totally innocent explanation that the police fail to spot). Undercover policewoman Jessica is assigned by eccentric police psychologist Taccone to follow Loris and provide evidence for his arrest - but things don't quite go according to plan...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>the movie is built around Loris, the character played by Roberto Benigni. who delivers best performance. he is 100% belevable in this role. the movie has almost all classic ingredients of a great comedy and they work.Roberto Benigni's character captures that facet of most of us men at some point in our lives. a lazy and not so well organized guy, far from hansom looking, who'd like to have a lot of women and money, but not yet successful with neither, improvising plans and schemes to get them fast and easy, getting himself in trouble instead, and plunging into more trouble the more he tries to sort things out.eventually the police is after him (the police surveying tape is hilarious), as goofy as Benigni's character is, the police match him with style. they dispatch a bait to unleash the monster within, and Loris has to go great lengths to avoid unleashing that monster =))watch this movie in Italian with subtitles, don't let some lousy dubbing spoil your experience.</p>
