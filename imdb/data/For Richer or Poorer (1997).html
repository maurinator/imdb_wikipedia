<h1>For Richer or Poorer (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The incredibly rich, but miserable New York couple, Brad and Caroline Sexton, got framed by their accountant, and fled from the IRS to the one place where no one would look for them: Amish country. Now they've got to do their best to blend in, and learn how to love all over again.</p>
<p>A real estate hustler and his wife hide from the IRS among the Amish.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am not a lover of comedies, however this is one of those exceptions.What can I say? The title says it all. Tim Allen is brilliant (as usual), and Kirstie Alley is great as his support. The movie does not knock the Amish people too much, and the movie ends with everyone living happily ever after - even 'Big John'.I thought the deleted scenes/bloopers i the closing credits was a great idea too.</p>
