<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Its hard to convey just how moving this movie is.  Its absolutely haunting, I thought about this flick for days afterwards.  I don't think it represents the experiences of many Argentines during the era of the juntas, but it clearly shows how awful those times were and why Argentines never want to return to that situation again.</p>
