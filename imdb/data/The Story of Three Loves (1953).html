<h1>The Story of Three Loves (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three loosely connected love stories. The first story: Paula is a talented dancer who cannot truly live unless she dances. But has a heart condition, which means she cannot live if she does. The second story: Tommy despises his French tutor, and hates being a child. He wants to be an adult so he can do what he wants. He gets his wish, being transformed into a handsome young man for one evening, and learns about whole new side of his French tutor. Third story: Pierre Narval is trapeze artist who gave it up when his partner died doing a dangerous stunt at his bidding. He rescues Nina, a beautiful young woman, after she throws herself into the Seine, and convinces her to become his new aerial partner. Her husband had been killed by the Nazis during the war, and she blames herself. They fall in love, which is tested when Nina must perform the stunt which killed Pierre's former partner.</p>
<p>The Story of Three Loves is set on a cruise ship, and focuses on three passengers who remember past loves -- a ballet choreographer, a governess, and a former trapeze artist. The choreographer recalls the ballerina he met, loved, and lost; the governess remembers a brief, mysterious meeting with a handsome stranger; and the trapeze artist remembers ruefully how he lost his love because he repeated past mistakes.</p>
<p>An anthology film consisting of three very different stories about love set in Europe and told in flashback.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>MGM put together these three stories of passengers on board a ship remembering three recent romances that all ended rather differently for the protagonists. The three passengers are James Mason, Leslie Caron, and Kirk Douglas and each one had things turn out quite differently.The first story The Jealous Lover concerns ballet impresario James Mason and his protégé Moira Shearer. The story is a bit of condensed version of her film, The Red Shoes. Shearer is the greatest ballerina of her time, greater than even her aunt and teacher Agnes Moorehead, but she has a congenitally weak heart. As for Mason who is it he really loves, the woman or the ballerina?The second story, Mademoiselle, could have served as the inspiration for the Tom Hanks movie Big. Leslie Caron is the French governess of a rich American kid, Ricky Nelson, who's both spoiled and bored with his French lessons and eager to grow up. A visit to a neighbor Ethel Barrymore who's a witch in her spare time grants him a few hours until midnight as a grownup, in this case as Farley Granger. He's everything the love lost Caron could hope for.The last story is Equilibrium with former circus trapeze artist Kirk Douglas saving Pier Angeli from drowning herself in the Seine. He lost a partner in a circus accident years ago and despaired of ever finding someone and returning to the circus. Angeli may just have the right stuff to be that partner, but Douglas is also looking at her in more than a professional way.Equilibiium got the most acclaim, Kirk Douglas and Pier Angeli were given a film of their own, Act Of Love, later to do. I liked all three of the stories, they were stylishly written and performed. Vincente Minnelli did the second story, Gottfried Reinhardt directed the first and third.All three stories end rather differently so you can expect quite a roller-coaster for your emotions. But the ride is well worth it.</p>
