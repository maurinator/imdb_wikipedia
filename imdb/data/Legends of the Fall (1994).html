<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dispite some of the reviews, i think this film is one of the best ever made. i have seen it a hundred times. the sweeping score, the Montana backdrop and the plot are just some of the things that make this film great. i would recommend everyone to see, although not everyone will like what they see as it requires a certain taste. 11/10</p>
