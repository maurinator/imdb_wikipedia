<p>Manhattan in the not-too-distant future seems a lot like Tokyo. Two friends who live on the margin try for one big score. One is Fox, older, limping, philosophical. The other is X.

She heads for Morocco; Maas is ready to wire $100 million to a Swiss bank account; X fears for Sandii's safety. Will it all work out?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a decent Abel Ferrara movie,with Walken turning in another memorable performance.I figure any movie with Walken's name listed in the credits first is worth watching.It did feel like the most important scenes were not filmed, and the rehashing of earlier scenes in the third act is really tedious. Overall, I think this movie would have been great with a bigger budget, but as it stands, I'd only recommend this to Walken fans.</p>
