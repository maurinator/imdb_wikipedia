<h1>Grace of My Heart (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An aspiring singer, Denise Waverly/Edna Buxton, sacrifices her own singing career to write hit songs that launch the careers of other singers. The film follows her life from her first break, through the pain of rejection from the recording industry and a bad marriage, to her final triumph.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That Allison Anders film wasn't seen by a wider audience is a realshame. The film is excellent, it has a real heart to it, and thesoundtrack is possibly the best I've seen in a film about making music.Illeana Douglas is totally convincing as songwriter 'Denise Waverly',the support from Turturro is both amusing and weirdly moving.   It's hard not to have the suspicion that if this film had been made bya man, then he would have been widely feted as THE next big thing. The moment where Douglas sings the song "God Give Me Strength" to MattDillon in the studio makes my hair stand on end even as I type this. AndI'm wearing heavy duty wax in my hair</p>
