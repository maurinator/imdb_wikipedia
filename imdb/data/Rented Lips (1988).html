<h1>Rented Lips (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A documentary filmmaker, who has spent the last 15 years making films like "Aluminum: Our Shiny Friend," is finally given the chance to make the documentary on Indian farming he has always wanted to. The catch? He must simultaneously direct a porn film. But as he tries to make the porn film, which he turns into a musical called "Halloween in the Barracks," he must deal with a temperamental actor, a fundamentalist preacher, and other obstacles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whenever anyone asks me about the worst movie I've ever seen - I ALWAYS say, "Rented Lips." Thankfully, these lucky people never know what I'm talking about. I only saw this because I'm a fan of Downey Jr's... and much like the Ally McBeal saga was - no matter how much of a fan I am of his, there are some things I just can't sit through.This film is just bad... I don't remember if it was Downey Sr's directing, or Jennifer Tilly's existence, or the fact that Martin Mull was in it AND wrote it (look at all these warning signs.. and I still decided to watch)... I just remember how much I couldn't believe that it actually got made... Thus reaffirming my belief that ANYONE can make a movie these days.Save yourself folks... Even if you're Downey Jr fans... If you want to sit through a bad Downey Jr movie, go rent Two Girls And A Guy.. at least you'll get some singin, dancin, Shakespeare and great acting in that one.</p>
