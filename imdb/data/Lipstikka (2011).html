<h1>Lipstikka (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two women reunite in London, where they go over the details of a life-changing event which occurred when they were teenagers in Jerusalem.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are two movies here. And while this seems like a good deal, the end result isn't quite as satisfying as you wish it would be. One thing I can't tell you, is how much this is based on real life events. Though if I were to guess I'd say it is purely based on real life, from what I saw in the movie that is.While the main storyline is unfolding, there is this other (subplot if you want to call it that). Something that works a lot better then what we see as main story. The balance therefor is a bit off. If I were to judge only the so-called "subplot" (I stay vague so you can enjoy the movie and how it unfolds without any prior knowledge/spoiler) I would rate it much higher. As it is it is more than a decent movie, with good performances (especially by the younger actors). I am looking forward what this particular filmmaker is going to do next</p>
