<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film on TV for the first time last week.  Although the story line was a little weak, the  film sequences at sea  were excellent, particularly the final storm (white squall) in which the boy actors portrayed the reality of the tragedy.Jeff Bridges gave a good performance as the captain whose task was to instil discipline and develop the characters of the boys in his charge.  However, some members of the crew were miscast.I highly recommend this film.</p>
