<h1>The Boys (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brett Sprague is a violent and psychopathic man, who is released on parole after serving a sentence for assault. As he returns to his family house and we watch him and his brothers, Stevie and Glenn, for the next 24 hours, it becomes clear this day will not end well.</p>
<p>A chilling film rife with domestic violence features Brett Sprague (David Wenham), a man on parole whose thin veil of humanity becomes evident within hours of moving back in with his girlfriend, two brothers, and mom. Manipulating and intimidating everyone in the household as the mother fails to keep together the family in Brett's wake, the family becomes beset with Brett's omnipotent presence evidenced in the following quote from the end of the film: "We're all gods in our own world". The beginning of the film features eerie piano music from The Necks while showing still images of everyday household objects, illustrating how the ordinary can take on meaning often larger than itself and providing escape for the inhabitants of this household run by a sociopath.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The reason I was riveted by this film is because it was so real.  And so Australian.  I know lots of blokes like Brett Sprague.In the scene where Brett accuses Nola of calling the cops, Nola turns away from him and Brett says "Hey....hey, look at me." In the nonchalant way he says is more terrifying than if he was yelling at the top of his lungs.  You can tell there's something evil festering away inside Brett.David Wenham puts in one of best performances in Australian cinema.  His domineering portrayal of Brett was one of the most chilling I've seen in recent years.  I'd rank it alongside the animal presence in "In The Winter Dark" for pure scare value.This movie is what Australian film is all about. Not cross-dressers going cross country in a bus, or a bunch of idiots having a zany family christmas, or even a full Australian cast falling over themselves because the main star is American.1998 was a fantasic year for Aussie films, & The Boys was one of the best.**** out of four.</p>
