<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't hate the film. I just happen to like Jeff Bridges, who as an actor just can just rise and conquer, no matter what material he's given, and in this weak dawdling thriller with little surprises, he's not given. Farrah too deserves better than this. In fact you'll catch a few glimpses through the movie, where she looks ashamed to be doing this, and rightfully so. Bridges plays a wanna be children's book writer, who's just suffered his 29th rejection. He works in a department store where he lays eyes on Farrah, which most men would, and is instantly smitten. No s..t, this movie seems to lose it's sense of direction, where there are many parallels to another weak Bridge's thriller, The Morning After, which came about ten years later, where Bridges here too, stands by her to find who's responsible for taking his husband out. I must say John Glover, an unbelievable character actor provides a great villain at the end. There are other good actors too wasted in this limited thriller. What it does have working for it is the chemistry between our two leads, where I must say I loved bearded and bumbling Bridges here, where it's a pity he wasn't getting better material. It is a fun jaunt of a movie, Bridges the one real reason for the movie's attraction. Honestly the screenwriter needs to attend a mystery thriller class, instead of stuffing around or even clowning around with story.</p>
