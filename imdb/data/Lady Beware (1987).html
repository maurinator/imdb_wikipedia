<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Katya is window dresser for a big department store in Pittsburgh, her sensually erotic displays unintentionally attracts the curiosity of Jack; a handsome married serial stalker, who quickly develops an obsession and believes she is seducing him with her windows displays. Her resistance only seem to excite him more, as he becomes bolder and bolder watching her every move to the point of driving the poor woman to a nervous breakdown. But take heart Katya is not the victim for long, and sets out to even the score, the ending culminates with an exciting story climax. Be sure to watch this enthralling story it will make you think twist about who is watching you. I highly recommend it, as a guilty pleasure. Diane Lane performance is sumptuous,the characters are well define, and the story plot and dialogues are expertly written.</p>
