<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has always been a mystery to me. I loved it and chuckled to myself all the way through it, however, for some reason I have never been able to explain,it just does not work like it should.Great cast from top to bottom, good charaterization and  many good scenes and some others that just don't quite work. I love it anyway and watch my copy at least twice a year.</p>
