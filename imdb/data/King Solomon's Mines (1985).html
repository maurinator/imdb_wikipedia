<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a movie rated so low by others but by some it gives them a reminder of indiana jones. Next to those movies this one is the next best. I would recommend it to indiana jones fans who have been waiting years for another sequel. This movie has a sequel too which is almost as good but get a bit slower at the end. The movie is really good though. I enjoyed the storyline, the actors, the music by Jerry Goldsmith is very enchanting, the only thing i could say isnt that good in this film are the special effects but for the time being it will do. Theres nothing to lose so go out and rent it!</p>
