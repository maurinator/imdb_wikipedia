<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"If These Walls Could Talk" is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen in my life.  It is divided into 3 segments:  1) 1950s - Demi Moore plays a woman who must either face becoming the town tramp or getting an abortion; 2) 1970s - Sissy Spacek is a woman forced to choose between losing her lifelong dream or terminating her pregnancy; and 3) 1990s - Anne Heche must come to terms with her own choices amidst a world of hate.  All 3 parts are brilliant, each very special in its own way.  Demi Moore gives a terrific performance in her role.  Sissy Spacek is equally impressive.  However, the greatest deal of my praise must go to the '90s portion.  Anne Heche is absolutely incredible.  Cher also appears as the abortion doctor, as well as directs this part.  The ending is so shocking and disturbing that it will leave every viewer breathless.  That being said, this film is not for the light of heart.  But if you are seeking a well-made movie with a shining cast, "If These Walls Could Talk" is for you.</p>
