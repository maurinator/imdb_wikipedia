<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Hughes does a tremendous job of portraying school as an oppressive  prison in which children are forced into the most unnatural setting to memorize useless facts to "get their grade." _The Breakfast Club_ is another example of this, but FBDO does it tremendously well.  The setting portrayed at the school of the bored students listening to a nasal monotone lecture, while intended to be a caricature of the nature of classroom lessons and children's reactions, was pretty much on target.Ferris Bueller takes the day off and what does he do?  Certainly not what Rooney assumed smart teenagers will do.  He didn't use this time to damage some bedsprings with his girlfriend, or play video games.  No, he viewed fabulous pieces of art, ate at a very classy restaurant, participated in a parade, and taught his friends a few lessons in some interesting ways.As a believer in education as an organic experience, this movie is a real eye opener to anyone wishing to educate their children outside of the public school venue.  It's funny, and shows just how worthy time "living your life before it passes by" can be.10/10</p>
