Can Alex and Shiela overcome cultural, age, and lifestyle differences and find happiness?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a wonderful film with an out-of-sight uncredited series of great songs.  Strangely, it's not included on Yahoo's list of Altman films. Offers great insight into the adult dating scene. Henry Gibson (of Altman's Nashville) has a non-singing part.  Singing cast includes one of the Neville Brothers.  Think of it as Nashville with an extended boy-meets-girl plot and no political overtones.</p>
