<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In NYC, Jack Jericho (Robert Downey Jr.) is an unabashed pick up artist. He spends his time chasing after every girl on the streets. Alonzo Scolara (Harvey Keitel) is gun wielding criminal. Flash Jensen (Dennis Hopper) owes him money and his daughter Randy (Molly Ringwald) has to pay. Jack has no long term relationships other than his grandmother and Randy is even more reluctant. She's a museum tour guide and he's a grade school teacher. He becomes obsessed with her.This movie struggles to find the rom-com feel. These two actors are the most likable actors of that era. They have a nice back and forth banter. The scary criminal gambling story doesn't really fit. The tone is all over the place. The old fashion music doesn't fit either. I would really have loved RDJ and Molly Ringwald in a more straight forward rom-com. Jack is a rather horrible character. This seems to be written for older worn-out characters. James Toback is simply not the rom-com type.</p>
