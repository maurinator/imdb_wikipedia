<h1>The Blue Yonder (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Have you ever thought of traveling through time...going forward or backward to any date? That's the intriguing question aviator/inventor Max Knickerbocker (E.T.'s Peter Coyote) asks Jonathan Knicks (Huckleberry Fox of "Terms of Endearment"). Max is unaware that Jonathan is his grandson - already an adventurous time traveler thanks to a machine built by his neighbor, Henry Coogan (Academy Award-winner actor Art Carney). Can Jonathan save his grandfather from a fatal solo flight across the Atlantic and alter the course of history?</p>
<p>Jonathan Knicks, a Little League baseball player and fan of airplanes and flying, travels back in time to 1927 using his elderly neighbor's time machine to try to stop his young-at-the-time grandfather, Max Knickerbocker, a pilot and craftsman who is planing to fly across the Atlantic which will cost him his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's rare to see me liking movies made purely for television, but this one, while by no means great, is okay.Time travel has always been a fascinating subject. Perhaps this movie isn't the most original because it has many similarities with 'Back To The Future'. The similarities have to be more than coincidence and they even came out in the same year.I'd like to travel in time, visit other generations, times I didn't live in. It would be fun to experience some of that, although, like everything in life, there would be risks. But sometimes it's necessary to take chances, otherwise we do nothing in life.Other than the interesting idea of time travel, this movie also delivers good cinematography, good performances by Peter Coyote and the charming Huckleberry Fox, a decent combination of the year 1985 (present day) and the year 1927 (almost 60 years before), good environment and feeling of both times (especially 1985), decent amounts of adventure, action and cleverness.</p>
