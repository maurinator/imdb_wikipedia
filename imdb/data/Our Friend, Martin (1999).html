<h1>Our Friend, Martin (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is the story of a black teenager named Miles, who has to go on a class field trip to the museum of learning what Martin Luther King Jr. did for humanity, he thinks that he'd rather play baseball. But the trip turns into an exciting adventure when he and his best friend, Randy, who's white, are sent back in time meeting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr at several points during his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just showed this movie to my 5th Grade classes as part of a series of Social Studies lessons on Martin Luther King, Jr.  We had just finished reading a book in which many of MLK's accomplishments and honors were explained, so the movie really helped tie it all together for them. They were absolutely entranced by it! (I had to stop 45 minutes into it so we could go to gym class and they were so upset- they almost didn't want to go!) The combination of animation and real footage was very well done. The students also enjoyed the hip music and famous voices.</p>
