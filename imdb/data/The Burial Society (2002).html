Having sought and found refuge within this ancient religious society, Sheldon finds himself captivated by this unusual and powerful world and the three old men who run it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a neo-noir with a humorous feeling to it because the main character is a timid accountant who embezzles $2 million from a money-laundering bank and then joins a Jewish burial society to cover his tracks. Rob LaBelle and the cast play it straight, but the story grows in seriousness as it proceeds.The visuals are not neo-noir, but the focus on criminals throughout and the predicament of the accountant make it noir. One IMDb reviewer writes "Burial Society is a film noir, a bargain basement emulation of early Coen Brothers style." Another writes "The film does share some qualities of the good films that the Coen Brothers used to make, but it seems to be less interested in playing into genre expectations." And "The film is a VERY dark comedy..." The film focuses on LaBelle's efforts to hide in a town and join a burial society so that he can cover his tracks. The 3 older men he works with add considerably to the movie.The film is easy to take and quite enjoyable, but upon reflection I see that important parts of the story are not shown or are skipped by quickly or are only spoken of in dialog. The film doesn't come across as fully-developed because of these omissions. It's also rather blah in tone.</p>
