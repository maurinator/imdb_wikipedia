<h1>The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of Mel and Edna (Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft), a middle-class, middle-aged, middle-happy couple living in a Manhattan high rise apartment building. Mel loses his job, the apartment is robbed, Edna gets a job, Mel loses his mind, Edna loses her job . . . to say nothing of the more minor tribulations of nosy neighbors, helpful relatives and exact bus fares. The couple suffers indignity after indignity (some self-inflicted) and when they seem on the verge of surrender, they thumb their noses defiantly and dig the trenches for battle.</p>
<p>Married couple Mel and Edna Edison are middle aged, empty nested, middle class New Yorkers. Mel is slowly unraveling and he knows it. The company he has worked for for twenty-two years has hit difficult financial times, and he is only its latest casualty. With the exception of Edna herself, every other thing in his day to day grind seems to be eating at him, which is exacerbated by incidents concerning their Second Avenue apartment, and the heat wave, combined with the build up of garbage around them, especially right below their fourteenth floor apartment balcony. He is in a catch-22 situation where not being able to find a job fuels his depression, which he almost uses as an excuse for not working hard to find that replacement job. Despite being by his side, Edna can't help but be negatively affected by Mel's constant negativity about everything. As Edna decides to go back into the workforce after twenty-two years of being a mother and housewife, Mel eventually suffers a nervous breakdown. Edna and Mel's outwardly successful older brother Harry do whatever they believe they can to help Mel both financially and emotionally, but Mel himself may have to figure out what he needs to do to get back on the road to mental well being.</p>
<p>A suddenly unemployed ex-executive suffers a nervous breakdown.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Being a Jack Lemmon fan, I can't help but be biased when it comes to watching his films.  But I have to say, even by Lemmon's standards, "Prisoner" is one of his finest performances.  He displays a broad range of emotion as Mel Edison, a corporate exec who falls victim to the unemployment crisis of the seventies.  Anne Bancroft is nicely cast as his wife, Edna--it's almost hard to believe watching this film that this is the same woman who played in "G.I. Jane" as a crooked senator.  And, although another viewer here frowned upon the casting of Gene Saks' as Mel's brother Harry, I always enjoy seeing the director in front of the camera (Saks directed another of my faves, "The Odd Couple").  The direction is pretty tight, and the interludes between acts include humorous voice-overs from a fictional radio announcer (you'll have to listen closely to catch some of the jokes).  Look for Sylvester Stallone in a cameo appearance.  I heartily recommend this film to all Jack Lemmon fans, as well as to those who enjoy a good comedy that's not all slapstick and guffaws.</p>
