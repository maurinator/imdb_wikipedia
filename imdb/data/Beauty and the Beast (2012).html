<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't understand the negative reviews, I enjoyed the first episode and found it demanding of my attention (I watched on HULU while doing other tasks... or not doing them, because, as I said, it grabbed my attention). The acting in this show is quite a bit better than most CW offerings, and Jay Ryan is well cast as Vincent. IMHO, and Kristen Kreuk's personality aside (I don't see how it has anything to do with the quality of the show, as actors are notoriously self absorbed, so I think the hit piece published above is irrelevant and I'm surprised it was approved) I find Kreuk's performance to be just the right combination of tough exterior with fragile insides. So far as the story is concerned, it's off to a bit of a slow start, but it's not uncommon for a good or even great show to take some time to build it's world. This will take a bit of time as the writers seem very focused on establishing the two main characters and their relationship to each other. I was also impressed that the action sequences did not dominate the show. They were short, well done and added to the story instead of hiding any flaws. This one I'll be giving a few episodes to see how well it builds.</p>
