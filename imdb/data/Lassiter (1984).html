<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the first movie I ever reviewed in my hobby/career as a movie critic.  When I first viewed it, I wasn't impressed.  It's one of those movies that you'll find is better with a second viewing.  It has interesting characters and while it has a copycat scene right out of 'The Sting', it is still an entertaining romp set in pre World War II Europe with impressive sets, costumes and the Nazi element thrown in as villains for great conflict.  A worthwhile movie to view and to be taken for what it is. Selleck is very good but the best character in the film is an English police officer played by Bob Hoskins.</p>
