<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The final Animaniacs project was released on VHS on Y2K Eve but I didn't see it until it aired on Teletoon Retro a few days ago.All the characters from the show are here but instead of being in their natural habitats they have all been placed in a town called Acme Hills. The Warners and friends are under the oppression of evil King Salazar; who took over their land in a hostile takeover and forces those in Acme Hills to live in abject poverty. As well, Dot needs an operation to help save her life. Wakko goes into the outside world and he returns with a Ha'penny which he intends to use to pay for the operation. However, Baron (Thaddeus) Plotz takes the money away as taxes and leaves Wakko broke again.Wakko then makes a wish to the stars and Pip (a character similar to the one Ben Stein voiced in an episode) grants Wakko his wish but he must trek to where it fell. He tells everybody about the news and it ends up being a mad dash to reach the star, including Baron Plotz and the Evil King Salazar.Wakko's Wish, sadly, isn't the ultimate Animaniacs movie I had hoped for. The story is done to death and the Animaniacs come off this time around as dull. Very few moments of zaniness abound and those moments are the only reason to sludge through the badly disjointed and overlong songs and redundant plot devices. The voice acting is good but it seems many characters have been toned down a lot, such as Jess Harnell's Wakko (who sounds more Continental than British) and Pinky (seemingly less nutty) among others. The animation is terrific and the characters have never looked better but everything else screams mediocre. If you're a huge Animaniacs fan as I am, you should still see the movie and decide for yourself if they finished the series with a bang or a whimper. I feel it was both and that's never a good result.</p>
