<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of watching Jason Figgis' wonderful film adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic "A Christmas Carol." I was extremely touched by it's wonderful heart. The film has a superbly haunting musical score by Michael Richard Plowman which implores you from the beginning to really sit back and take in this new version. I loved the way that Mr Figgis took his time to set the scene with the opening credits as the music had a brilliant mix of haunting religious tone and eerie sense of evil while still sounding Christmassy. The film captured that sense of cold which I feel would have been be so truthful of the time it was set. The casting of all actors were spot on. Scrooge, played by a superb Vincent Fegan, looked as miserable as you could get without resorting to false makeup but still displayed at certain moments the ever so subtlest touch that within him was some good, however small it was at the time. I really liked the way that the Ghosts were presented, both in a visual and emotional sense and through the captivating performances by the actors involved including an excellent Bernadette Manton. Neill Fleming's performance as Bob Cratchit was brilliant as he gave his all in one truly touching emotional scene. His performance balanced beautifully in the film with his wife, portrayed by the superb Jane Elizabeth Walsh whose resentment, anger and bitterness was reserved for the character of Scrooge. They worked wonderfully together. I loved the performances of Scrooge's nephew and his wife - gentleness, poetry and beauty shot out from their eyes, body and soul. I think this film has wonderful poetic visions, haunting and uplifting images and the brilliant balance of cold and warmth of the heart. Jason Figgis truly deserves, in my opinion, a lot of praise for this superb film as he masterly weaves the utterly miserable Scrooge with the emotionally heartbreaking Bob Cratchit to create a tale which delicately balances the often coldness of one's actions with the heartfelt redemption of one's soul. Striking ghost-like imagery, splendind cinematography including one marvellously candle-lit room, and captivating acting performances all combine to create a poetic movie tapestry. I highly recommend this movie and really believe that Jason Figgis is a director to look out for in the future.</p>
