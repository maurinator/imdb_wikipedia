<h1>The Empty Canvas (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The son of a wealthy American woman and a deceased Italian nobleman, Dino, dabbles away at painting. Thinking he has found the image for his "empty canvas", he takes up with man-crazy nymphet Cecilia, who refuses to marry him--even after he covers her nude body with 10,000-lire banknotes. She does agree to become his mistress--until a more interesting man comes along. Dino has a breakdown and is guided back to health by his mother. He tells her at fadeout that now he has suffered, and he thinks he might be able to fill that empty canvas.</p>
<p>The son of a dead Italian nobleman and a wealthy American woman forgets the disappointment of finding he has no talent for being a painter by succumbing to the sexual advances of an amoral model who believes in indiscriminate love affairs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is interesting that sex is often used in movies as garnish. But, when sex becomes the entr√©e, it is usually viewed as boring. This is exemplified in James Bond movies and in movies like The Empty Canvas. But why sex becomes drab is what makes The Empty Canvas so interesting. To those of us who believe that sex is merely a mechanical act devoid of deeper meaning, this film may be preachy. To those of us who view the act as something more, this film should be revealing. Eyes Wide Shut, Smooth Talk, and Looking for Mr. Goodbar are also films with sex as the main theme. How people respond to such films can say a lot. Playboy magazine hated Taxi Driver because Travis Bickle didn't make it with Betsy. Obviously and unfortunately, this skin deep mentality has made Hugh Heffner exceedingly rich and films like The Empty Canvas rare.</p>
