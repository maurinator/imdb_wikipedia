<h1>Ponette (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An extremely captivating movie on how a little girl copes with her mother's death. She withdraws from all the people around her, waiting for her mother to come back. She tries waiting, and when her mother still doesn't appear, tries magic chants, praying to God, and then becoming a child of God, to have some power over Him. All to no avail. But then, when she is in despair, her mother does come back ...</p>
<p>A four-year-old girl tries to come to terms with the sudden death of her mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I do not believe I have ever seen a film that comes anywhere close to "Ponette" before.  While I would not consider it my favorite film that I could watch over and over and over, it is easily one of the stronger movies I have seen.  Rarely do I view a film that is so precise and cohesive even though it simultaneously plays off so many different themes, like sentimentallity, nostalgia (we all remember the strange social world of the playground though maybe some of us don't want to go back), the pain of loss, and (gasp) humor.  Most directors and actors would get lost at one point or another, not knowing how to segue or shift from one tone to another, but here there is nary a problem with doing so, which is especially amazing considering the leading lady has been walking and talking for about as long as it takes to make a bowl of oatmeal.  The best scenes for me were the trials that the older girl put Ponette through.  The dumpster one was especially great.  Considering that early on in the film I sympathized with Ponette when she cried during some scenes, I felt bad laughing at her suffering through the tests, especially when her hand got caught when the dumpster lid came down.  I believe some of this movie was improv, so for all I know, the poor girl really got her hand hurt, but I remember those type of moments as a child; those tests of stamina, durability, agility, etc.  I put my younger brother through some horrific ones.  One time he broke his arm.  How could I have been so cruel?A performance artist/singer named Suran Song recommended I watch this film.  In Suran's performance, she actually uses slides of the scene where the mean little punk Antoine is playing with Ponette on the playground and begins to verbally abuse her about her mothers death.  The context Suran used the scene in her act seemed to be making a statement about how people treat others in society, even when very young.  Interesting how she sort of sampled an individual scene and made it into a story of her own, because it plays much differently in the film as a whole (obviously) since we know the characters.Probably not for everyone, but certainly for those who want to a see a piece of work very left-of-center yet not oddball in any way; simply a viewpoint that wouldn't normally seem worth making an entire feature film out of because it would be hard to pull off.  Ponette is not only pulled off... it goes flying to the moon.</p>
