<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me begin by letting you know I am neither black or white.  I say this so you don't think I speak from a particular bias.  I firmly believe that Spike Lee captured the central epic struggle within the black community and its overall effect on the American landscape as a whole.  I was happy to see that ALL aspects of the society were equally represented in this film without reinforcing dated stereotypes.  This is clearly Lee's greatest work. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE ONCE.</p>
