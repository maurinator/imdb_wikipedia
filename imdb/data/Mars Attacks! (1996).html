<h1>Mars Attacks! (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It is a normal day for everyone, until the President of the United States announces Martians have been spotted circling Earth. The Martians land and a meeting is arranged, but not everything goes to plan, and the Martians seem to have other plans for Earth. Are they just misunderstood beings or do they really want to destroy all of humanity?</p>
<p>The Martians decide to attack our planet and devastate everything. Why? Because it's fun!!! They enjoy killing people and destroy buildings; they even play bowling with the statues at Easter Isles and pose for photos in front of temples as they are blowing up. Will somebody find a way to stop them or will everyone die in the war with these short, big-brained aliens?</p>
<p>When the USA satellites photograph many flying saucers coming to Earth, the American President James Dale has a meeting with his advisers. He is convinced by Professor Donald Kessler that Martians would be a developed culture and therefore peaceful by nature, in spite of the warnings of General Decker. The authorities, some civilians and the press prepare a welcome committee for the aliens, but they realize that Mars is actually attacking Earth.</p>
<p>When Martians begin to attack the Earth, several groups of people must try to survive. These groups include a reporter and his girlfriend, a top scientist, the president and his family (and aides), a Kansas boy and his grandma, and Tom Jones and people from a casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>President James Dale of the United States and his right-hand man, Jerry Ross discover that an army of Martian UFOs are hovering around the Earth, and everyone has a different response. Some, like Texan alcohol dealer Art Land and slimy nesman Jason Black, just want to make a profit out of it. Others, such as TV hostess Nathalie Lake, Land's spiritualist wife Barbara, and the Southern-like Norris family, are excited, and some, like Dale's wife, Marsha, and daughter, Taffy, don't care. Richie Norris is extremely intelligent but is only respected by his insane grandmother, while his older brother Billy is favored for joining the army. General Decker doesn't trust the Martians and insist they fight, but General Casey is more optimistic. The Martians appear to come in peace but suddenly begin to use their super-powerful and technologically advanced weapons to wipe out the population and great structures. Soon, they attack Las Vegas, where the Norrises are living, where former heavyweight champion Byron Williams is visiting, where an obnoxious lawyer is gambling, and where Tom Jones is performing in concerts.</p>
<p>Earth is invaded by Martians with unbeatable weapons and a cruel sense of humor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When the USA satellites photograph many flying saucers coming to Earth, the American President James Dale has a meeting with his advisors. He is convinced by Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) that Martians would be a developed culture and therefore peaceful by nature, in spite of the warnings of General Decker (Rod Steiger). The authorities, some civilians and the press prepare a welcome committee for the aliens, but they realize that Mars is actually attacking Earth."Mars Attack!" is one of the most hilarious and entertaining movie of Tim Burton. Using a parody to the sci-fi of the 50's and like a shotgun, he criticizes the politicians and their greed to be popular; the arrogance and lack of humility of some intellectuals; the lack of sensibility of the army; the lack of ethics in the press; the shallow behavior of the first lady; and some silly cults. In the other side, he highlights the importance of friendship, loyalty and love. I particularly like very much the characters of Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan and Rod Steiger in the cast that is actually a constellation. Unfortunately Jack Black dies in the very beginning, because his character was also very funny. This movie is one of my favorite cult-movies, and a great homage to Ed Wood ("Plan 9 from Outer Space"). My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Marte Ataca!" ("Mars Attacks!")</p>
