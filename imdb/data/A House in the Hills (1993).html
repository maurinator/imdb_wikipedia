<h1>A House in the Hills (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An aspiring actress (Alex) is housesitting in the hills, the owners are taking a break after their neighbour was murdered. For acting practise, Alex pretends to be the owner when someone calls at the house. The caller isn't who he says he is either...</p>
<p>An aspiring actress gets a housesitting job and finds herself in a cat-and-mouse game with a deadly ex-con.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Saved by an intelligent script and some good performances, A House In the Hills chronicles a housesitters descent into the maelstrom of violence and lies at the heart of the California Dream (well, the Southern California one, at least). It's not Htichcock, but it's miles better than your average Showtime filler. Jeffrey Tambor delivers a particularly rich performance as next door neighbour Willie, and the rest of the cast is up to the task. Apparently filmed in Luxembourg, of all places.</p>
