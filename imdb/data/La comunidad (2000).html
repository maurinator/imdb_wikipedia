<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Julia finds 300 million pesetas hidden in a dead man's house while selling an apartment. She's a 40-ish real estate agent now forced to face the wrath of a very peculiar community (of neighbors), headed by an unscrupulous administrator. Black humor gives way to suspense, closely followed by horror that doesn't take long in coming to a head in undisguised pandemonium.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In every community there norms and rules. Some communities do not like it when a new person enters their community. If that person does not accept the rules, that person is not accepted into the community. In the movie, Commonwealth, by Alex de la Iglesia, if the rules are broken, people will die. Carmen Maura plays the role of the new neighbor, Julia. The combination of Julia and a large sum of money, is what destroys a normal community.Julia is an employee at the real estate agency. She moves into the apartment of one that she should be trying to sell. She moves into that apartment because it is much nicer than her own. When there is a leak from the floor above, she calls the firefighters in. She discovered the money that the man who lived there had left behind after he died. The neighbors discovered that she had the money and they all tried to get the money. Many neighbors dies because all of them were selfish and wanted the money for themselves. This plot is very different but interesting at the same time. I think that this plot is real, more or less, but a little extreme.The principal theme is that money can change a person in a very bad way. All the neighbors were mad with thinking that they wouldn't get the money. Nobody needed the money to live, but everyone thought that the money would make their lives better. This theme is very real and important. Many people today have the same opinion about money.There is a lot of blood and deaths in this movie. Therefore there are many special effects. The effects were necessary for the scene with the elevator, the fight between Emilio and Julia, the scene when Julia jump from her fall to the floor above, and the scene of the roof. I liked the photography of this movie. It was very easy to watch.I would recommend this film to my friends. I think that it was a very good and interesting film. The theme is an important lesson for everyone to learn.</p>
