<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Louie Jeffries is happily married to Corinne. On their first anniversary, Louie is killed crossing the road. Louie is reincarnated as Alex Finch, and twenty years later, fate brings Alex and Louie's daughter, Miranda, together. It's not until Alex is invited to Louie's home that he begins to remember his former life, wife and best friend. Of course, there's also the problem that he's attracted to Louie's/his own daughter.</p>
<p>This is a fiercely tender, sparkly sleeper gem, with stellar cast, about spirituality, the unconditional nature of the soul mate, loyalty and love and an alternate view to death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nay Sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love. This is a great film for anyone capable of understanding Johnny Mathis's song, or any song from that era: Bobby Darin's, Beyond the Sea... or Stan Getz's, The Girl From Ipanema, et al...I measure films by how many times I have to watch them before I'm satisfied... Chances Are had me back a few good times.I also watch the synergy between the cast... I thought they worked well together.Open your heart, and let the comedic magic of film transport you.'Alan</p>
