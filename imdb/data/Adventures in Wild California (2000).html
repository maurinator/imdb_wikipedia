<h1>Adventures in Wild California (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A visit to many of the places and people that give California its reputation as a place of extremes. Among the major segments: Sky surfing in the San Diego area; the movies, including a trip down the Oscar ceremony red carpet, the shooting of a stagecoach ride, and some memories of Walt Disney, including a roller coaster ride in Disneyland; some snowboarding and skiing stunts; a trip to the top, and then deep inside, some giant sequoias; biologists working with otters and bald eagle hatchlings; and a trip to the top of the Golden Gate bridge with the ironworkers who maintain it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a spectacular experience. From beautiful SpaceCam shots of the Sierra Nevada to the dizzying heights of the Golden Gate Bridge, this film will put you on top of a tree without having to climb it, drop you 6,000 feet to San Diego without getting out of your seat, and take your breath away with beautiful cinematography. Get strapped in for a ride you won't soon forget.</p>
