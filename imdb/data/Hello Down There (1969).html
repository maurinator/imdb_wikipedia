<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We loved this movie when we saw it at the theatre during its original release; I still have fond memories of the pet dolphins cavorting in the living room pool, and of the space-age push-button underwater conveniences (such as that neat pop-up refrigerator). I can even remember the lyrics to "Hey Little Goldfish" and "Glub, Glub"!! As kids we sang those songs for years. I can't wait to rent this one and rock out again with Dreyfuss and the gang! I hope he doesn't mind too much, 'cause I think this movie is a great sixties artifact, with a fun cast and very creative sets.</p>
