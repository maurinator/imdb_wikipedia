<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the spring of 1976, in the former peaceful town Tarker's Mills, the inhabitants are scared with violent murders and press Sheriff Joe Haller (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate further and find the responsible. Meanwhile, the crippled boy Marty (Corey Haim) is very happy with the new motorized wheelchair that his dear Uncle Red (Gary Busey) gave to him. During the night, Marty sneaks out to use the fireworks Red gave to him in a bridge. However he is attacked by a haired creature but Marty shots a rocket in the left eye of the attacker and escapes. Marty tells his sister Jane (Megan Follows) that he was attacked by a werewolf and convinces her to seek out who in town could have an injured eye. Jane discovers that the local Reverend Lowe (Everett McGill) is the creature but now the siblings have to convince Uncle Red to help them to disclose the truth about the reverend.In the 80's, "Silver Bullet" was a successful werewolf film on VHS in the rentals. I might have watched this entertaining movie at least twice in those years. Today I have just seen it again and I really liked it, specially the chance to see Corey Haim two years before "Lost Boys" and Terry O'Quinn decades before "Lost". But maybe the most important is the excellent transformation of the werewolf without the use of computers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Hora do Lobisomem" ("The Hour of the Werewolf")</p>
