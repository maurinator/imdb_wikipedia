<h1>Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two young men (Jon Cryer, Rick Stear) who have been friends since early childhood decide to go on a trip to find a third friend (Rafael Baez) who has long since disappeared. Stories they have heard indicate that the friend has been seen in an apparently rambling, incoherent state at Coney Island. Their trip leads them to a number of adventures involving the otherworld-like life at the Park and revelations related to their own pasts including the death of one's sister, a failed past relationship, financial failings, and alcoholism.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And I don't care how small the budget was.  I have fast forwarded less in pornographic movies.  Garbage plot, garbage dialog, severely mediocre acting.  I can't begin to describe how stupid the dialog was.  And oooh the shocking plot twist!  It was quite a technique, the way the severely overplayed, horrible dialog would foreshadow the climax, if you could watch it that long.  If I didn't live right in the neighborhood it was shot in, I would have turned it off half way through.  And I watched the movie with an optimistic attitude.</p>
