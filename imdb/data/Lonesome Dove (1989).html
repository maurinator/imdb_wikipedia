<h1>Lonesome Dove (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Epic story about two former Texas rangers who decide to move cattle from the south to Montana. Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call run into many problems on the way, and the journey doesn't end without numerous casualties. (6 hrs approx)</p>
<p>Retired Texas Rangers Gus McRae and Woodrow Call are content to live out their remaining years in the tiny Texas town of Lonesome Dove. Then their old friend Jake comes to town, and tells them about the incredible oppurtunities for cattle ranching in Montana. Encouraged by this, Call convinces Gus and many other townspeople to go on a perilous cattle drive to Montana. Gus has another agenda though: his former sweetheart now lives in Nebraska, and he hopes for a second chance with her. As the drive goes on it takes on an epic scale, ultimately becoming what could well be called the central event in the lives of all involved.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Larry McMurtry's wonderful story is beautifully and amazingly brought to the screen by director Simon Wincer.  It assembles together one of the best casts in movie history.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are nearly perfect.  Duvall has been quoted as saying that Gus McCrae was his favorite character he ever played.  He is certainly mine. Angelica Huston is the perfect person to play Clara.  It is almost like Larry McMurtry had some of these actors and actresses in mind when he wrote his novel.  The only exception is Frederic Forrest as Blue Duck.  He does a fine job with what he's got, but the man just isn't big enough or scary enough for this role. The story is incredible.  The scenery is beautiful.  Lonesome Dove is, in my opinion, the best western ever made. A definite must see for everyone.</p>
