<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>(*** out of *****)Barbara Bach plays a TV reporter who goes to the quaint, seaside town of Soveg, California with two of her female newscaster friends to cover an annual Danish festival.  Unfortunately, the three attractive ladies choose to spend the night in an old house outside of town inhabited by a seemingly kind man (character actor Sydney Lassick -- the constantly agitated `Charlie Cheswick' from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"), his nervous sister (Lelia Goldoni), and the product of their incestuous affair -- a disfigured, murderous man-child they keep locked in the cellar.  This is actually an interesting and creepy little thriller with decent writing, beautiful on-location scenery, and a few scary sequences that'll get under your skin.  It's kind of similar in tone and plot to Denny Harris's "The Silent Scream" from the same year.  Karen Lamm and Lois Young play Bach's unlucky friends and Stephen Furst plays the adorable, slobbering lady-killer, Junior.HIGHLIGHT:  That irrepressible little stinker Junior, God love Â‘im, gets a hold of poor, pretty Karen's (or is it Vicki's?) -- played by Lamm (or Young -- hell, one or the other) --  necklace and pulls her right through the floor vent.</p>
