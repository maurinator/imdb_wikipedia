<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Deadly Hero is a wonderful Don Murray vehicle.  After seeing this movie, one can only wonder why he did not receive more opportunities to display his tremendous acting ability.  Diahn Williams also does a fine job with her role, which would be her first and last big screen role.  And of course, I must mention James Earl Jones, who also delivers a fine performance. Great use of color within this film also is a plus.  Lastly, the dated orchestra/dance scenes are hilarious and fun to watch.  This movie is a great hidden gem-if you can still find it at a video store, do the right thing and rent this entertaining film.</p>
