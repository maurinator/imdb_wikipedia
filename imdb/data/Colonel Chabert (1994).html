<h1>Colonel Chabert (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Colonel Chabert has been severely wounded in the French-Russian Napoleonic war to the point that the medical examiner has signed his death certificate. When he regains his health and memory, he goes back to Paris, where his "widow", Anne has married the Count Ferraud and is financing his rise to power using Chabert's money. Chabert hires a lawyer to help him get back his money and his honor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Le Colonel Chabert is a great novella -- you can read it in a couple of hours.  It's better than this disappointing film, which moves slowly and ends differently, less satisfyingly, and more confusingly.  A lot of good Balzac dialogue was missing, and the extra details added were unnecessary. Balzac this ain't.</p>
