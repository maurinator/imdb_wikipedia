<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Grazia is a mother of three who spends suffocating days packing fish while her husband Pietro is at sea. Her oft-erratic behavior leads Pietro into thinking she may need medical attention, and he prepares to send her off to a psychiatric institute in Milan. Their son Pasquale, the one person who understand his mother the most, vows to do whatever it takes to foil his father's plan.</p>
<p>In this Sicilian fable, a beautiful young mother living on a small island excites the disapproval of her fellow villagers with her carefree behavior. When her relatives suggest she need psychiatric treatment, her son must help her escape the condemnation of the town.</p>
<p>On an impoverished Italian island, a free-spirited woman is accused of madness by townspeople fed up with her antics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I bought this film back in 2002 when I was first learning Italian, it's absolutely fabulous. Francesco Casisa and Filippo Pucillo are superb as Pasquale and Filippo and of course Valeria Golino as usual gives a perfect performance in her role of Grazia.The DVD that I bought has American subtitles which are desperately awful in places but manage to convey more or less what's being said.The soundtrack is very unusual, I love the original incidental music and its recurring theme which is repeated throughout the film. This is also where I first heard La Bambola by Patti Bravo.Some complain about the ending but I love it; watch the film to see what you think....</p>
