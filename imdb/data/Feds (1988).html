<h1>Feds (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ellie DeWitt and Janis Zuckermann are admitted to the very strict FBI Training Academy. They get a hard course, in which they learn to deal with guns and to recognise crimes. They also get a physical training. It appears that Ellie is a real fighting- machine, in contrast with Janis, the great student. They have to help each other, 'cause only when they pass all the tests, they are allowed to join the FBI...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Affirmative action says there have to be female cadets. Nobody says that the old boys network has to like it. Mary Gross is a perfectionist with more degrees than a thermometer. However, she's the proverbial 98 lb. weakling. Rebecca DeMornay took a couple of classes at a community college, however, she just got out of the Marine Corps and can kick the butt of anything or anyone that crosses her. Together, they're the ultimate agent, however, they've got to pass separately. The things they get into, the mistakes they make and the things they do spectacularly (and sometimes accidentally) right will keep you laughing and cheering to the end. Mary Gross getting beyond drunk and coming onto a sailor in a bar is worth it by itself.</p>
