<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this movie and finally was able to get a VHS tape on the internet after trying video catalogs for years. I have listened to the soundtrack when I'm busy, and it still gets to me. I can believe the storyline about the mutual attraction between Willie and his "temporary" singer. The climactic scenes were hilarious. I liked this movie so well that I also bought "Songwriter". I guess I'm going through a Willie Nelson period, but I have enjoyed him in all of his movies, starting with his short bit in "Electric Horseman", where I first noticed him. I had never heard his music until after I "discovered" him in "Electric Horseman". If I have any complaint about his music, it is that "On the Road Again" is way too short. I think that,as an actor, he grows on you and continues to get better each time, much like Chuck Norris did.</p>
