<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young drifter meets up with a strange old man who claims that he has been taught to fly by birds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all, this film is NOT in French.  The director is Swiss, French speaking, but Lightyears Away was filmed in Ireland, with Trevor Howard and Mick Ford speaking English, along with the rest of the small cast.  This film is essentially about a Zen master-pupil relationship. Howard is at his cranky best.  The cinematography is outstanding, somehow capturing the haunting beauty of the Connemara Peninsula in County Galway, on the west coast of the Republic of Ireland.Does anybody know where I can track down a copy of it?  DVD would be great.</p>
