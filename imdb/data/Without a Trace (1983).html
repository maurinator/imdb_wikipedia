<h1>Without a Trace (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film, centering on a child's abduction, casts Kate Nelligan as the distraught mother who lashes out at the police (in the person of a relentless detective played by Judd Hirsch), who treat her and her husband as suspects, even as she hounds them to find her child and drives away her husband (David Dukes) and friends (including Stockard Channing) with her intensity and single-mindedness.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie leaves me crying and heaving.  The strong, strong performance by Kate Nelligan warranted an academy award.  The range of motions she expressed - anger, fear, love, - and finally, joy.  Judd Hirsch, equally strong in the sometimes undermanding role of the cop.  David Dukes is probably the most unappreciated performance.  I have seen it many times, but this last time I watched him and the emotion, his pain showed through as well as Nelligan's.  A classic.</p>
