<h1>Three Sisters (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Olga, Masha, and Irina Prozoroff lead lonely and purposeless lives following the death of their father who has commanded the local army post. Olga attempts to find satisfaction in teaching but secretly longs for a home and family. Masha, unhappy with her marriage to a timid schoolmaster, falls hopelessly in love with a married colonel. Irina works in the local telegraph office but longs for gaiety. Their sense of futility is increased by their brother's marriage to Natasha, a coarse peasant girl. She gradually encroaches on the family home until even the private refuge of the sisters is destroyed. They dream of starting a new life in Moscow but are saddled with the practicalities of their quiet existence. Despite their past failures, they resolve to seek some purpose and hope when the army post is withdrawn from the town.</p>
<p>In a small Russian town at the turn of the century, three sisters (Olga, Irina, and Masha) and their brother Andrei live but dream daily of their return to their former home in Moscow, where life is charming and stimulating meaningful. But for now they exist in a malaise of dissatisfaction. Soldiers from the local military post provide them some companionship and society, but nothing can suffice to replace Moscow in their hopes. Andrei marries a provincial girl, Natasha, and begins to settle into a life of much less meaning than he had hoped. Natasha begins to run the family her way. Masha, though married, yearns for the sophisticated life and begins a dalliance with Vershinin, an army officer with a sick and suicidal wife. Even Irina, the freshest, most optimistic of the sisters, begins to waver in her dreams until, finally, tragedy strikes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a beautiful, glorious filming of Chekhov's brilliant play. Unfortunately, because it cannot be found on video, I had to catch it late-night on TV in order to see it. This really deserves a video release.The acting is superb, especially by Joan Plowright, Jeanne Watts, and Louise Purnell, who flesh out the conflicting characteristics perfectly. Olivier himself puts in a fine performance as the alcoholic officer, and two of Britan's finest actors, Alan Bates and Derek Jacobi, offer wonderful support. The photography by Geoffrey Unsworth is magnificent, and the simplistic production design makes you feel like you're actually in a theater watching a production. As always, Olivier does more with the theater than any other director could. Find it if you can- they show it on the ENCORE once in a while.</p>
