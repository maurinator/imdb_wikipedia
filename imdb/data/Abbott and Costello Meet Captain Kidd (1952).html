<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am an admirer of Charles Laughton,who I regard as the finest ever British screen actor.This is often viewed  as the nadir of his movie career but it did  seem to me he entered into the spirit of proceedings admirably,mugging energetically and taking pratfalls with the best of them Bud and Lou will satisfy their fans but win no new devotees in a movie slowed down by stultifyingly bad musical interludes and the colour is garish and uglyLaughton,seemingly relishing the chance to play a variant on the pantomime villains he doubtless enjoyed watching in the theatre as a child,is the main reason to give this the time of day</p>
