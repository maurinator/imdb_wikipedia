<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Six different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.</p>
<p>Six total strangers awaken one day to find themselves alone in a cubical maze. Once they meet, they work together using their given skills and talents to survive the deadly traps which guard many of the colored cubic rooms. Using Leaven's mathematical skills, they press forward, upward, and downward through the hatches to try and find the outer shell.</p>
<p>Six complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless kafkaesque maze containing deadly traps.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie just doesn't make much sense and  leaves the viewer with many questions. It has almost no special effects, the actors are  unknown and the story can be told in two  sentences. Yet, the atmosphere is tight and exciting. It is so tight, that I rate this movie as  a must see!</p>
