<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Documentary about the Basque nationalist movement in Spain.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There has been a lot of controversy about this documentary in Spain, basically coming from the conservative side. In my opinion, the film gives a real, sincere view of what the Basque problem is and what it means, and is at the same time, as objective a view as one from a Basque director can be.It mixes beautiful shots of landscapes with old archive images from the dictatorship and early-democracy days, parts of films (including Orson Welles "Around the world") with Basque traditions etc. But above all this, the "confessions", the views that about 70 people of all sorts give about the matter: politicians, singers, priests, ex-terrorists, etc.I have to say that I got emotional and IÂ´m not Basque. Food for thought of the best quality, worth seeing whatever is your positioning about the Basques. Don't forget we're talking about the maker of beautiful films like "Tierra" ("Land"), "Sex and Lucia" and "The red squirrel".</p>
