<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Estranged twin brothers - one a con man, the other an Episcopal deacon - accidentally switch places... and find God in the process.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Christian films are still in their infancy, and this film, while great, proves a point. Hollywood is still the "big dog" on the block and it's hard for a film with a positive message such as this to find a better place at the table. MERCY STREETS has a few good things going for it, starting with the acting. It's not a stilted as you'd expect from a religious-themed film. The writers took great care to avoid unnecessary and gratuitous cursing (even though the violent content garnered a PG-13 rating) and also to avoid being too "preachy" with the message. Writer/director Jon Gunn and co-writer John Mann bring a message of hope and deliverance to the screen in a truly artistic way. So, while the gun-play might be a bit much for young viewers, I think this film is a worthy addition to any home library.</p>
