<h1>The Bridge (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Isobel Hetherington and her three young daughters take up their seaside residence in the hot summer of 1887, life seems idyllic. But the arrival of Phillip Wilson Steer for his annual painting visit launches a chain of events that will change their lives forever. Overcome by his first sight of Isobel, Steer immediately decides to capture her on canvas - and as the painting grows, so does their love for each other. But jealousy and tragedy eventually force them to confront reality.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have watched this film several times and have always greatly enjoyed the images and the atmosphere. The Suffolk coast has been a long-time favourite of mine and the film does it great justice. I was not familiar with the paintings of Philip Wilson Steer but this film provides a wonderful introduction. The story is pretty lightweight but the excellent acting makes it all come to life quite magically. I'm not sure why the film was not more successful. It has plenty of drama, the setting and characters are beautifully filmed and the direction has just the right pace. Perhaps the movie world of the 1990's was not ready for the delights of Victorian Suffolk and its very distinct characters!</p>
