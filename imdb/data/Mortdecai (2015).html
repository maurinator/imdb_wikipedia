<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie actually made me register with IMDb to publish my displeasure. I've read the reviews here and typically they're from art house aficionados who sooooo want everything to have meaning. News flash, sometimes a movie is just a movie and sometimes humour is unsophisticated. Get over it.Johnny Depp seems to be a target for these reviewers at the moment. I found his performance/homage to Terry Thomas "rather good". The various cameos and supporting performances were also "rather good" The film is soaked in British humour and I can see how some from the "colonies" just don't get it but for people to give this 1 or 2 out of 10 is beyond belief.</p>
