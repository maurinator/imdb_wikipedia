<h1>P.J. (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Private eye P.J. is reluctant when he gets a new job: he shall protect Maureen Preble, mistress of millionaire Orbeson, mainly from attacks by his wife and her greedy family. In truth Orbeson plans a deadly intrigue in which P.J. is to play a central part. Meanwhile P.J. falls in love with Maureen and Orbeson's money.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>PJ was originally released in the late 60s when movies were rated either "G" or "M"; anything with any questionable content was rated "M" and Studio execs, with the wisdom of their breed, realized they might as well put in as much as they could get away with. The result was some delightfully tasteless sex and violence in films like NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY, DEADLIER THAN THE MALE, GUNN, TONY ROME... and PJ. Unfortunately, when these were released to TV, the studio execs, with the wisdom of their breed, cut out all the best parts and substituted banal "made for tv" scenes. As originally made, PJ contains some really gritty moments that really capture the sleazey aspects of the PI genre. Hopefully, someone will make this available on Video soon.</p>
