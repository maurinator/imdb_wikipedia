<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen Citizen Kane and wasn't half as impressed with it as I was with this film which I credit to producer and writer Marty Kaplan (who, as I understand, is a CPA).  The only thing this movie lacks is violence and nudity, not that it needs either.I've never seen a more thorough and realistic comedy about government and politics before or since this film.  Only Bulworth comes close, yet the solutions suggested in that film were just as liberal as the institution it parodied.  There are a few liberal connotations in The Distinguished Gentleman (particularly environmental), but they are immediately balanced and authenticated by the conditions presented in the story.This film isn't an absolute probe into political science, but it gives a more lucid perspective of politics than the media would ever care to attempt.  Eddie Murphy's performance is vintage, particularly his mimicking skills and his genuine comedic brilliance.  A moment that defines the film is when his character gives a victory speech which consists exclusively of several cliches coined by historic politicians ("'Four score and seven years ago...'  'If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen...' 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself...' 'Ask not what your country can do for you...' and in conclusion 'Read my lips!'").  The crowd response, as with actual politicians, is full of mindless cheers of concurrence.Political experts may find this film silly and full of inconsistencies. Yet, the fact is, most movies are silly compared to reality.  This film, however, does not insult the viewer and gives political novices a good idea of political mechanics while presenting a hilarious performance.  The fact presented in this film is that the most powerful people are the most corrupt, and corruption can only be defeated by more clever and deceptive corruption.This is not a film for "Generation X"ers who rate a film on its music soundtrack and how thoroughly the females cast in it prostitute themselves. If you appreciate the comedy of Eddie Murphy and have a critical appreciation for politics, you will enjoy this film.I'd give it a 9.5, but the IMDB won't allow decimals.</p>
