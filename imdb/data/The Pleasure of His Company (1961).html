<h1>The Pleasure of His Company (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>San Francisco debutante, Jessica Poole, is marrying Napa Valley cattle rancher, Roger Henderson, and hopes her peripatetic father, "Pogo" Poole, whom she hasn't seen for years, comes to the wedding. He arrives, disrupting the household of his ex-wife, Katharine, and her long-suffering husband, and befriending their cook, Toy. At first it seems that Pogo is set on breaking up the engagement, making up for years of neglect by wining and dining Jessica, showing up Roger as a hick, and enticing her to come to Europe with him. Then it seems his real goal is to win back Katharine's heart: why else would he have two tickets to Paris booked on a plane leaving right after the reception?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well written, intelligent and elegant: Oscar Wilde in the sixties in San Francisco. It's a pleasure to see all the fine actors play out the nuances of their lines. Especially Lilly Palmer, who is absolutely wonderful and attractive.</p>
