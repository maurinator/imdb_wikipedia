<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'Spaceman' is the consummate low-budget film despite the bad acting, writing, directing, editing, and dubbing.  After being drawn into this silly movie I soon realized that it's not bad at all.  It takes so many professional shortcuts it actually enhances the humor of this Indie/Hollywood satire.  It's the funniest sci-fi, fish-out-of-water, gangster, kung-fu, love story I have ever seen.  The entire film revolves around a nerdy-but-deadly, severely obedient, warrior savvy, alien-trained human, who crashes back to earth years after being abducted by aliens as a boy.  Watch and laugh as Spaceman searches for a new commander to take orders from while working as a stock-boy and escaping the FBI.  Think 'Starman' meets 'The Terminator' meets 'The Sopranos' and you barely come close to describing this wonderfully original and funny film.</p>
