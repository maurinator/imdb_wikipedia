<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nicholas Meyer's end of cold war spy comedy/thriller is a light hearted affair that after a fun start runs out of steam at the end. However, for a film that was supposedly subject to significant studio input during the production, it emerges as a competently directed fun ride that is let down but an abrupt and sudden ending. From the looks of the end credits, filming that took place in Anguilla might explain that there was a different ending that for whatever reason was unfortunately cut from the final film. In fact one of the films problems looks like some scenes were cut short Â– the film has all the hallmarks of potentially being a longer and more interesting film and does look like the running time was cut down too much.That being said, Gene Hackman is yet again in commanding form and dominates the picture in an enjoyable way, exuding plenty of gruff charm. Baryshnikov's character complements Hackman's quite well and Kurtwood Smith and Terry O'Quinn are fun characters. However, some of the performances of other supporting cast members are very uneven and broad. For example Oleg Rudnik, who plays a Russian chief spy, comes across as very wooden rather than the excellent performance seen of him in 2010. The films make use of real locations, and the climax on the Eiffel Tower is fun, albeit the best work are sequences on the Berlin Metro, which are well done and exciting. Credit has to go to veteran British production designer Ken Adam's work, and there is also a solid contribution from veteran photography Gerry Fisher. However their work, and the strong performances, cannot help the film get over its truncated climax, and the film's ending leaves the viewer very frustrated that the film wasn't tied up much better. Overall an enjoyable romp spoilt by a poor ending.</p>
