<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Strolling home one night, Los Angeles police detective Steve Cochran interrupts a robbery in progress at a drugstore.  He fatally shoots one of the perps and books the other.  A marked $50 bill in the loot came from $300-grand robbery-homicide in New York.  Cochran and his partner Howard Duff trace the bill back to the pharmacist, the bartender who passed it to him, and Ida Lupino, coat-check girl and part-time singer at the bar.  She claims a drunk tipped her with it one night after she sang him `Smoke Gets In Your Eyes' five times; the cops don't quite believe her, but it doesn't matter.  Cochran is falling for her, even though his cop's salary won't snare her the diamond bracelets she's after.Over the next week, they drag her to a racetrack where more of the marked cash is being uttered, in hopes that she'll spot her tipsy tipper.  When she does, Cochran and Duff go off in hot pursuit.  The getaway car hurtles down an embankment, killing the driver but leaving cash blowing around the ravine.  Cochran pockets about $80-grand and turns over the rest, leaving Duff angry but not angry enough to break the inviolable code: Never rat out your partner.  Cochran makes Duff an unwilling accomplice by giving him a duplicate key to a rented trailer where he's stashed the money; it's parked in slip #36.   But then Cochran gets a phone call from a stranger who claims the cash is his and wants to make a deal....Opening with an initial burst of two brutal robberies, director Don Siegel then slackens the pace but not the tension; he moves the story forward through character rather than incident.  The square-rigger Duff tries to dissolve his guilt in alcohol, to the distress of his wife (Dorothy Malone, in too skimpy a role); Cochran and Lupino seesaw up and down, back and forth in their more volatile liaison.  The fifth major player, Dean Jagger, as the detectives' canny superior, senses that their story doesn't quite add up.  Written by Lupino and her ex-husband Collier Young, the movie departs from the usual formula by not making current spouse Duff Lupino's love interest; perhaps in consequence, Duff loses the cocky, ingratiating mien he often adopts, while Cochran runs off with the meatier role.  Private Hell 36 stays lean and hard-edged (with help from cinematographer Burnett Guffey); it's among the better offerings from the latter years of the noir cycle.</p>
