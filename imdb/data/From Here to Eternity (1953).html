<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's 1941. Robert E. Lee Prewitt has requested Army transfer and has ended up at Schofield in Hawaii. His new captain, Dana Holmes, has heard of his boxing prowess and is keen to get him to represent the company. However, 'Prew' is adamant that he doesn't box anymore, so Captain Holmes gets his subordinates to make his life a living hell. Meanwhile Sergeant Warden starts seeing the captain's wife, who has a history of seeking external relief from a troubled marriage. Prew's friend Maggio has a few altercations with the sadistic stockade Sergeant 'Fatso' Judson, and Prew begins falling in love with social club employee Lorene. Unbeknownst to anyone, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor looms in the distance.</p>
<p>US Army Schofield Barracks, Oahu, 1941. Capt. Dana Holmes is an ambitious officer who will do anything to get promoted to major. Sgt. Milton Warden, Holmes' assistant, wants to make his own army life as easy as possible by making the Captain's life as easy as possible, despite Warden having no fondness for Holmes or officers in general. Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt has just transferred, on his own request, from the bugle corps at Fort Shafter to this infantry unit. The transfer also included a demotion from rank of corporal. Prew made the request on principle, as he was lead bugler in the corps, he known as the best, but it a position which was reassigned to another enlisted man based on nepotism. It is also on principle that Prew refuses to be part of Schofield's inter-regimental boxing team, it a sport he loved and was good at until an in-ring incident led to his friend being permanently injured, despite the incident not being Prew's fault. Regardless, Holmes and the boxing team members place pressure on Prew, including intimidation, to buckle under to the request. Warden begins an affair with the seductive Karen Holmes, Capt. Holmes' unhappy wife, the affair despite Karen having a reputation among the enlisted men, some who can attest to that reputation first hand. In reality, Karen is running away from her unhappy life as much as she is looking for something meaningful emotionally to replace it. In Karen's eyes, for them to have any future, Milt has to become an officer, something he may not be willing to do despite the two of them loving each other. And Prew falls for Lorene, a working girl at the New Congress Club, a private men's club off base. Lorene truly does dislike her life as a working girl, she aiming for respectability which means a life with someone who does not know her as Lorene, but rather only as plain old Alma Burke from small town Oregon. What happens between all these players is not only affected by their interrelationships, but also the private battle between Prew's friend, Pvt. Angelo Maggio, and the brutish Sgt. James 'Fatso' Judson, the Sergeant of the Guards at the local military prison, and by the events of December 7th at Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>At an Army barracks in Hawaii in the days preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor, lone-wolf soldier and boxing champion "Prew" Prewitt refuses to box, preferring to play the bugle instead. Hard-hearted Capt. Holmes subjects Prew to a grueling series of punishments while, unknown to Holmes, the gruff but fair Sgt. Warden engages in a clandestine affair with the captain's mistreated wife.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"From Here To Eternity" takes place right before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Thus, it's really not a war movie. Actually its more of a soap opera with Burt Lancaster putting the make on Deborah Kerr and Frank Sinatra having a fight with Ernest Borgnine and Montgomery Clift having a tryst with Donna Reed, which brings me to the element of the movie that I really liked: Donna Reed's character. In the movie Donna Reed plays a prostitute who wants to earn enough money to go home, but by the end of the movie circumstances have transformed her from cynical prostitute to fianc√© and bereaved victim who has lost her man, and for whom things would never be the same. To me, this is what a good movie is all about - powerful and compelling character development within the context of a story that is credible and makes sense.</p>
