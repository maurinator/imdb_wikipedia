<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is fantastic. Very moving film about the relationship between humans and animals that a lot of people can quite easily relate to. Katie (the gorilla) is an intelligent creature who creates a strong bond with a troubled teenager (Rick) that takes them on an adventure neither would ever forget. And as for Wizard-8 saying "the gorilla costume isn't very convincing", Katie was in fact played by a live gorilla. They may be strong, powerful creatures, but they are also very intelligent and are able to perform once trained. And Wizard-8 also said "I think only very young children might get some enjoyment from this - everyone else, stay away", and this is also false - I am 21 and still enjoy this film. It's a fantastic story well worth seeing!</p>
