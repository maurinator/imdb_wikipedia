<h1>Rancho Deluxe (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack McKee (Jeff Bridges) and Cecil Colson (Sam Waterston) are bumbling drifters who make a living by rustling cattle in the wilds of Montana. Jack left his wealthy parents because he resented their posh lives. Cecil is of Caucasian and Native American descent seeking his own path in life away from his grumpy cowboy father (Joe Spinell). Both Jack and Cecil hustle and rustle their way in the world by targeting cattle owned by wealthy ranch-owner John Brown (Clifton James). Frustrated that someone is killing his cattle, John hires a pair of ranch hands, Burt and Curt (Richard Bright and Harry Dean Stanton), to find the rustlers. When Brown realizes he cannot trust his two inept ranch hands, he turns to the grizzled former rustler Henry Beige (Slim Pickens) to find the cattle thieves. Jack and Cecil always stay a step ahead of their pursuers, not realizing that their luck must run out sometime.</p>
<p>Two drifters, of widely varying backgrounds, rustle cattle and try to avoid being caught in contemporary Montana.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two modern day day cattle rustlers cut up stolen cattle while talking about the tooth fairy.  Macho ranch owners who at one time used to run beauty parlors.  Romantic candlelight dinners that turn into wild sex orgies and last but not least $50,000 steer who tears up a motel room.  You also get to see the 'world championship pong game'.  This is the very first video game that two of the rustlers play while talking business.     This is just a few of the off the wall ingredients that await you in this thoroughly engaging, thoroughly quirky little charmer.  To say it is just quirky wouldn't be doing it enough justice because it is much more than that.  Writer McGuane literally takes every cliche and then playfully works against it. It's success comes from it's ability not to betray itself.  No contemporary or 'normal' characters and no broad humor.  It's flashiness comes through it's subtlety and laid back nature.  Like a good western ballad it's sly and knowing without ever looking like it.     This is somewhat similar to McGuane's 92 IN THE SHADE that came out at roughly the same time.  Both are good and deal with eccentric characters and humor yet this one fairs better.  Mainly because director Perry edits it more tightly.  All scenes revolve either around character or story developement. No scenes are excessive in length.  Thus you have a better pace and better story momentum.     This is a fun movie to watch over and over.  Simply because it is so original and done in a very original way.  It also makes a good point about the decline of the modern day west which is and maybe always was just a state of mind.     Slim Pickens has his best supporting role since DR STRANGELOVE.     Filmed on location in Montana which is gorgeous and a real treat since a lot of films aren't done there.</p>
