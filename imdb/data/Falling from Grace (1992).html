<h1>Falling from Grace (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rock singer John Mellencamp makes his screen and directorial debut in this story by "Lonesome Dove" author, Larry McMurtry. The story, not too separated from Mellencamp's real life, finds him as a country music star whose meanderings and philandering has thrown his life into turmoil. Returning to his native Indiana to try to reestablish a normal life. Instead he takes up with an old lover (Lenz), ignoring his loving wife (Hemingway), and duplicating the lifestyle of his womanizing father (Akins).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view. I thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part. When he says, "your having an affair with the ol' man", to his co-star, I kinda chuckled at his facial movements... or lack thereof. I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not as a Saturday night video. If you love his music, then the video has a little music from him in it, but not much. So so.. at best</p>
