<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A group of Arab extremists kidnap an American airline's airplane and threaten to kill everybody as a way to prove their hate for the other nations and shock the world.At the same time in that the negotiations become tense and marked by hostilities, a special army force is activated to rescue the passengers and kill the dangerous fanatic terrorists. Action film that counts with the cast's excellent interpretations, formed by famous movies stars such as Martin Balsam, Joey Bishop, Hanna Schygulla and others, with prominance for Lee Marvin. Directed as an espionage thriller, "Delta Forces" alternates dangerous and risky scenes with moments in which the suspense reaches high levels, reminding the Hitchcock's thrillers. Filmed in several locations of Middle East and counting with an extraordinary photograph that exalts the whole hot and claustrophobic climate of the story, "Delta Force" offers an excellent entertainment, even seeming racist and simpleton in some occasions, and it is the best motion picture of Chuck Norris's career. The most touching sequences, among so many others, are the violent fight of the specialist in martial arts' hero (Norris) with the terrorists' leader (interpreted by Robert Forster, from "Jackie Brown", in a good, but sometimes over acted, performance) and the Norris' attempt to go up in the airplane that is about to take off, at the same time in which he is pursued by the Arab army!! "Delta Force" is rated for violence and it runs 126 minutes. The cast:Lee Marvin, Chuck Norris, Robert Forster, Joey Bishop.</p>
