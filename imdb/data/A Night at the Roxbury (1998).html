<h1>A Night at the Roxbury (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Roxbury Guys, Steve and Doug Butabi, want to get into the best club in town, and also hope to open their own club. Vivica, a gold-digging supermodel, and her friend Cambi try to work the Roxbury Guys for their money, only to find out the pair is broke.</p>
<p>Steve and Doug Butabi dream of opening their own club as cool as the Roxbury. The problem is, they are so uncool, they've never even been inside the Roxbury. They still live at home and work at a plant store owned by their dad who is pressuring Steve to marry Emily, the daughter of the owner of the neighboring lamp store.</p>
<p>Steve and Doug Butabi are club-hopping brothers whose father only wants them to work in his fake plant store. Steve and Doug share one dream - to open their own nightclub. This is complicated, however, by the fact that they can't even get into the one club that they'd give anything to be in. Things start to look up for them when one night they get into a car accident with Richard Grieco who gets them into the club where they meet two "hotties", Cambi and Vivica. There's also Emily, the goody-two shoes college girl who Steve's father wants him to marry.</p>
<p>Two dim-witted brothers dream of owning their own dance club or at least getting into the coolest and most exclusive club in town, The Roxbury.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is fun. It is a relaxed movie about two brothers. Their hobby is visiting clubs. But they have a problem....they are not the two coolest people. Dressing with nice clothes and driving in a BMW does not really help because they act stupid. But they have a dream - to own a club - and maybe this comes true. The movie is set in LA and has nice disco-music in it.the comment on DVD says it is the dumb and dumber of disco...and they are right..it's something like that. I think it is entertaining enough to watch more than one time because a few scenes are really hilarious. See it for your self.</p>
