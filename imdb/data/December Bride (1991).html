<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The theme music for December Bride is remarkable. The German composer JÃ¼rgen Knieper wrote it for the production. It is original and has a strong thematic character. Recommended.And since we're forced to discuss the requirement of length, why the heck does IMDb demand that we write at minimum 10 lines in a comment? I would be writing for longer than the episode was on TV and about nothing. Luckily they have given me a topic to type onward about because, in order for this to be a valid submission; in order for me to ask whether you, the interested parties, noticed or cared about the length of the broadcast, i must go on for ten, bloody lines.</p>
