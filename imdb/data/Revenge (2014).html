<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>was excited for this movie. I liked the first one, even if the story was shallow, just because I loved Tekken the game... but Tekken 2 was no way Tekken, not even close. I don't know what they were thinking about when they did the film, there was just no value to it... too slow, fight scenes were terrible... and "ruthless" assassin was not really the case... it was just awful and I can't find anything positive to say about the film except when it ended which I thanked the high heaven because I could finally breath. it was terrible, did I say that? it was like when sloppy writing meets terrible research, you get Tekken 2... it was so awful it was so agonizing to watch. there was really no Tekken to it,</p>
