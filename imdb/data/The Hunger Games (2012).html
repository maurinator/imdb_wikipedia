<h1>The Hunger Games (2012)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives.</p>
<p>Set in a future North America known as "Panem", the Capitol selects a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve outlying districts to compete in the annual "Hunger Games", a televised fight-to-the-death. The film is centered around Katniss Everdeen - a 16-year-old girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12-year-old sister, Prim, when Prim's name is chosen - and Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta Mellark, with whom she has some rather dramatic history. Katniss is then rushed to the Capitol, where she undergoes intense training before being thrust into the arena to fight to become the victor of the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games.</p>
<p>In order to control future rebellions by remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four players must kill each other and survive in the wilderness until only one remains. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population. In District 12, teenager Katniss Everdeen is a great hunter and archer. When her younger sister, Primrose Everdeen, is selected as one of the "tributes" of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark, they head by train to the Capital to be prepared for the brutal game.</p>
<p>Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take the place of her sister to be placed into a revolutionary game called The Hunger Games, where kids kill each other for one to take the crown. Katniss fights for herself and her sister with another boy from her district, Peeta Mellark.</p>
<p>Katniss Everdeen lives in a place called Panem. Panem lies on what used to be North America. Panem is split up into 12 districts. Each year, every district is forced to randomly choose two tributes--one girl and one boy--to fight in the annual Hunger Games. A fight to the death on live television. Katniss Everdeen takes her sister's place when she is called to be the tribute of the 74th annual Hunger Games. Katniss will be trained to kill all the other tributes and be the victor of the 74th annual Hunger Games.</p>
<p>Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised competition in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to fight to the death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I read the book years ago and loved it. Now after watching the film I am certainly disappointed. This film is a cookie cutter thriller at best. Save your money and don't watch this; just read the book. The film is similar to the Alice and wonderlands most recent adaptation; the visuals are great, but the story is butchered. I mean love is nice, yet I find myself more entertained by the notion of it when its focus is more than skin deep. Yet, there is no love put into this film it is entirely focused on entertaining your peripheral and lacks substance in dialogue and explanation as well as some of the story being altered in presentation from a book to movie. This may have to do with having a pg-13 rating. I am sure Ms.Collins is more disappointed with the out come than I. Just don't bother disappointing yourself and stay home when you find the urge to see this in theaters.</p>
