<h1>The Perfect Storm (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In October 1991, a confluence of weather conditions combined to form a killer storm in the North Atlantic. Caught in the storm was the sword-fishing boat Andrea Gail. Magnificent foreshadowing and anticipation fill this true-life drama while minute details of the fishing boats, their gear and the weather are juxtaposed with the sea adventure.</p>
<p>Billy Tyne is a sword-fishing-boat captain out of Gloucester, highly competitive and stung by a string of poor outings. His crew is hardly back in port when he tells them he's going out again, even though it's October and the weather can turn ugly. Five join him: the young Bobby, newly in love; Murph, a devoted father recently divorced; Sully, a guy Murph despises; Bugsy, who's finally met a woman who likes him; and Alfred, a quiet Jamaican. They catch little, so they sail east, with Tyne ignoring storm warnings behind him. Finally, the fish bite, but the ice machine fails. Should they head home through the storm of the century, or wait it out and lose their catch? Fearful, the women wait.</p>
<p>An unusually intense storm pattern catches some commercial fishermen unaware and puts them in mortal danger.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like films like this. The characters have depth and are interesting or likeable.  The whole film has that gritty, gray look to it. There's no generic hero type and the bad guy is the storm. Peterson did a great job with this film. I believe it is his best directorial job.  The movie is well cast and my only negative thing is that the great Christopher McDonald was hardly used at all (almost just a cameo). This is a great movie for DVD. Good effects, acting, and music. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly.</p>
