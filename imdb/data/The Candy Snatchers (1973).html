<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>THE CANDY SNATCHERS is among the proudest components to the druthers of 70s drive-in cinema, a smart, slick production that's well mechanized and laden with dodgy allure...a highly original exploitation mini-masterpiece, and a classic of its kind. With a turbo-thrust pace, this nail-biter of a kidnapping/ransom story is steeped in noir, and presents three appallingly churlish amateur criminals intent on purloining a generous haul of diamonds from the shady stepfather of kidnapped young Candy(an appealing pubescent girlie who spends the entire film in various stages of bondage wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform). Plans run afoul, however, as the plot twists and shifts like a roller-coaster flying hot off its rails. A mute little boy is a key sideline character whose odd presence seems entirely superfluous until the unforgettable, head-smacking climax. You do NOT want to miss this one.8.5/10</p>
