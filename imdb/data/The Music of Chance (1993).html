<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mandi Patinkins portrayal of Jim Nashe is brilliant. Jim is a great character- a somewhat mysterious man cruising aimlessly in his beautiful BMW, when, on a whim, He picks up hitch hiker, Jack Pozzi, a down on his luck gambler, played so well by James Spader.That is the first clue. How many of us driving alone picks up a stranger looking the way Pozzi did on that particular day.As they drive towards New York city, Pozzi tells Nashe about his great gambling opportunity to make it big time- all he needs is to be bankrolled. The following story is one of being free, willing to take the chance of an adventure into the unknown and above all, about honor, integrity and being a man in the very best sense. 10 out of 10.For me, a very inspiring film and tale.</p>
