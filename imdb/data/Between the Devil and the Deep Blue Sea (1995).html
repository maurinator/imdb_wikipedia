<h1>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film tells the story of a strange friendship between an adult, already on the return of his path of life, and a Chinese girl who just begins her path. Nikos is the radio operator of a merchant ship and has just arrived in Hong-Kong. He is tired and wants to forget his problems by smoking opium. Innocence and hope turns to him in the person of Li, a Chinese girl who lives in a Sampan (a houseboat) and has to clean boats and empty trash-cans to survive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film in 1997 and have hunted for it since. It´s one of the best I´ve ever seen - at the same time very moving, sad, ugly and beautiful. Stephen Rea is one of my favourite actors and perfect for this role, I think. This film touches you. It makes you think. Extra points for the end, which is lovely and surprising, like a haiku poem. It makes you leave the film with a glad feeling.</p>
