<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chad Gates has just gotten out of the Army, and is happy to be back in Hawaii with his surf-board, his beach buddies, and his girlfriend. His father wants him to go to work at the Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company, but Chad is reluctant. So Chad goes to work as a tour guide at his girlfriend's agency.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is something about Elvis in Hawaii that makes so much sense to me. The fact that several of his movies were made there is not surprising at all. I enjoyed this one very much - he has some great chemistry w/his co-stars and Angela Lansbury gets to overact as his possessive Mother. All in all, I liked the movie very much and who can resist hearing the King sing "Can't Help Falling in Love With You" on more time?</p>
