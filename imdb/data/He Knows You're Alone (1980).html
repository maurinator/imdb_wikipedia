<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some of the scenes in this movie , while we have seen them before, are worth a view, rather odd at times.Tom Hanks in a bit part as a psychology major talking about fear and how audiences pay to be frightened , as a spoof of the movie itself.Tom Rolfing as the Michael Myers type villain is good, this is a comparable film to "Halloween". The scene with the fish tank is something you will remember for a few days, at any rate. The scenes in the amusement park are good, better than "Terror Train" a vehicle which included, of all young struggling actors, Bill Maher.Anyway, if you are up for it, there is also an amusing scene with now famous James Rebhorn ("Far from Heaven", "The Incredible Mr. Ripley") as a cheating professor having an affair with his student. He comes to a bad end, here. 6/10.</p>
