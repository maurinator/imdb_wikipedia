<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have read several reviews of this film, and I have to say that men just aren't going to "get" this one.  Our local paper's reviewer said he just didn't get the "stars in the eyes" of the women leaving the theater.  His review didn't even MENTION Colin Firth.  Well, I will!  Colin is what is going to attract women to this film, and he does not disappoint.  He is the best thing about the movie.  Amanda Bynes is cute, and I enjoyed her too.  The rest of the cast is quite good too...Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley, for those Pride and Prejudice fans...), and Eileen Atkins, particularly.  I found the storyline about the daughter longing for her father and the father who just discovered her quite sweet and moving.  Yes, the script was a bit sloppy and the humor often falls flat, but overall, Colin Firth's performance made it worth seeing for me.  This is definitely a chick flick, though :)</p>
