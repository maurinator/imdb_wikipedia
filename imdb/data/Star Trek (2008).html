<h1>Star Trek (2008)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a Star Trek theme review, the Nerd dons a yellow Starfleet uniform and decides to review a couple Star Trek related games, cause reviewing all of them would be too much for him to handle. The most absurd one he can find is the 25th Anniversary game for the NES which consists of pointless dialog and confusing quests, the Nerd thought about destroying it with a phaser but had a change of heart believing that the game developers tried their hardiest when making the game.</p>
