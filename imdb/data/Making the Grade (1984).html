<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For anyone who was alive and well in the 80's this movie is the funniest of all time. Of course you might need to remember the Preppy Handbook, putting pennies in your shoes (or coins from other countries if you wanted to be really cool), nicknames like Bif, Kiki and Buffy, and men wearing pink and yellow.The star of this movie is the REAL Palmer Woodrow, Dana Olsen. It is a shame it doesn't look like he is still in the business.The character of Rand is well played and is very, very funny.Andrew Dice Clay, Gordon Jump and Judd Nelson all put in solid performances.I have this on DVD...it is great.I really wish they made Tourista. That would have been excellent.</p>
