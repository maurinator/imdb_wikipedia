<h1>Overlord (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the war a young lad is called up and, with an increasing sense of foreboding, undertakes his army training ready for D-day.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fantastic little "war" gem this. Stands to reason why it won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Filmfestival once. We are offered visually very beautiful images of documentary footage from world war 2. In an extremely competent manner this material is mixed into a fictitious story about a young soldier´s life and death as a soldier participating in the famous D-Day invasion (Operation Overlord).Don't expect another Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day.....Overlord is by far too "experimental" for that.Well, it's really impossible to compare these films, but rest assured Overlord will deliver a very unique war movie experience, like you´ve (probably) never seen it before.</p>
