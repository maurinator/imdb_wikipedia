<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A thrilling action adventure story is the scenario for "Fair Wind To Java." There is fighting among pirates and good guys, a graphic flogging of a beautiful slave girl and a massive eruption of a volcano, all in brilliant color. Although it's the usual good guys vs. bad guys genre, the story line is good and action abounds everywhere as the good and the bad search for a fortune in diamonds. Good performances by MacMurray, Ralston and Douglas.</p>
