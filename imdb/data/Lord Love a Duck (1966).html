<h1>Lord Love a Duck (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>High-school senior Barbara Ann Greene has a lot to overcome to reach her dreams to be popular, get a job, find a husband, and maybe even be a movie star: she's poor, her parents are divorced, and her mother is a cocktail waitress. Right beside her, though, is her best friend and Svengali, Alan. He helps her get 12 cashmere sweaters, a job in the principal's office, spring break at Balboa, and more. Along the way, the satire bites teen mores, beach-blanket bikini movies, adults in charge, the country-club set, Christian-youth programs, older men's fantasies, and teen girls' innocence. How popular will Barbara Ann become, and what lengths will Alan go to get her there?</p>
<p>High school senior girl-next-door Barbara Ann Greene is worried about going to a new school, Consolidated, for her senior year since she has always been popular, but she is worried that her popularity will wane at Consolidated since no one knows her. Although she loves her cocktail waitress mother Marie, Barbara Ann feels that their home life is one potential obstacle her her ultimate happiness. Along comes fellow high school senior Allan Musgrave, who's given himself the nickname "Mollymauk" after an extinct bird. Allan seems to have all the answers to Barbara Ann's problems, including how to get into the popular circle at school, how to get the boy that she wants (college student, aspiring marriage counselor and mama's boy Bob Bernard), and how to get an acting career. But Allan may not be able to grant her final want without compromising himself.</p>
<p>A bright satirical comedy about an innocent high school girl granted her wishes by a student prodigy. A broad satire of teenage culture in the sixties, its targets ranging from progressive education to beach movies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I put this movie in a category with other slightly anarchic anti-establishment movies such as "The Graduate," "If..." and "The Magic Christian." The only difference is that it pre-dates all of them. Being the first of its kind, its a slightly awkward film that doesn't always know what to do with itself. There are plenty of holes in the plot, and, if its a comedy the dramatic scenes are too strident, if its a drama then it is all done with too much flippancy. On the whole, though, I really enjoyed it. I don't claim to be an expert on the culture of the mid-sixties, but it tackles a lot of topics that seemed to be taboo at the time, like Marie's death, and their rather self-conscious use of the word prostitute. The acting is all excellent, I was particularly impressed with Tuesday Weld's performance. I had never really thought of her as anything more than the vapid lead to a bunch of teen movies, but I was really surprised at what a good actress she was. Roddy McDowall is excellent as Mollymauk, but the uneveness of the film doesn't do the character justice, and you get the feeling with a little more work on the plot and the pacing, he could have made the film hysterical.Anyway, it was a good film, particularly impressive when you think of it as the prototype of a genre of film which is still being produced today.</p>
