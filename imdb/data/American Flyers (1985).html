<h1>American Flyers (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sports physician Marcus persuades his unstable brother David to come with him and train for a bicycle race across the Rocky Mountains. He doesn't tell him that he has a brain aneurysm which could render him paralyzed or dead at any given moment. While David powerfully heads for the victory, Marcus has to realize that the contest is now beyond his capabilities. / Features great views of the Rockies and an insight in the tactics of bicycle races.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"American Flyers" makes for some decent sports entertainment if you fancy competitive cycling; but even as sports movies go, the '80s offered better options. I have to admit, it was on-the-cusp-of-stardom Kevin Costner's confidence in the role that kept me in this game. It wasn't until the 90-minute mark that things actually got pretty good. Not just with those scenic mountain passes, but it also finally attains some of the emotional weight it's been dancing around all this time (which has been mostly McDonald's commercials and a soundtrack right out of a beer commercial). And then it just . . . stops. There wasn't really anything in that last race to get all tense about.</p>
