<h1>Thank God It's Friday (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's Friday and everyone is going to the hot new disco. The Commodores are scheduled to play if Floyd shows up with the instruments and Nicole dreams of becoming a disco star. Other characters are there to win the dance contest, or to put a little excitement into a fifth anniversary.</p>
<p>It's Friday night in Los Angeles, and the place to be is the Zoo, a disco where The Commodores are performing for a dance contest. The Zoo is owned by the smooth talking Tony Di Marco, a Lothario who is not averse to using his position to pick up women, single or not. Bobby Speed, the DJ, is doing a live radio broadcast, which may be his last if The Commodores don't show up in time ready to perform. That may not happen as the disco's missing-in-action roadie Malcolm Floyd is having one problem after another getting the band's instruments to the Zoo. Bobby's job may also be on the line if Nicole Sims, an aspiring singer, gets her way in hijacking the DJ booth to play her demo and/or sings live over the airwaves. Frannie, with her best friend Jeannie in tow, has come to win the contest to earn enough money to buy tickets for the upcoming KISS concert. Their problem is that they may not even be able to get into the disco being underage. New to town Jennifer, who is at the Zoo with her know-it-all when it comes to picking up men friend Maddy, just wants to meet a nice guy. Ken, who is at the Zoo with his near-sighted overconfident friend Carl, just wants to meet a nice girl. The primary question in this situation becomes whether nice girl Jennifer and nice guy Ken will ever meet each other in the crowded disco. Straight-laced couple Dave and Sue have just had their fifth wedding anniversary dinner out on the town and are about to go home, when Sue suggests they extend the evening by going to the Zoo instead. While Sue is somewhat ready to party, Dave tries to overcome his fish-out-of-water status to keep up with his wife. Gus and Shirley, who meet at the disco on a computer blind date, have to decide to call it a night or stick around to make the best of a bad situation. And Marv Gomez, who is at the Zoo every night, can't get into the groove until he changes into his "Leather Man" persona and gets onto the dance floor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really like Thank God It's Friday because reminds me of my very young years.  Perhaps this movie today does not represents much, but is itself a simbol of an era.  At that time (1978) the movie was a fashion hit due to the disco vogue, becoming the Academy Award Winner as the best musical theme in 1978 (Last Dance).  Donna Summer was at the top of her career, and Jeff Goldblum with Debra Winger were new debutants in the movie business, who years later became big Hollywood movie stars because of this movie.  This movie is actually a lot much better and fun than many other musicals.  The music itself has better quality than much of today's music which absence of quality, taste and talent is so evident (and presence of violence, terrible languaje and sex and drugs abuse is so evident as well).  The only one thing I really don't like from this 1978's movie is the consumption of drugs, but at that time that was considered pretty tame. However the young people at that time watched the movie more for the fun to enjoy it and the fashion of the disco vogue, than the drugs use or abuse.  This movie is much fun and it is a way to say : go ahead and have fun at least one time in your life!. Be young and be happy once everywhile!  Dance and enjoy yourself!  This is an Anmerican classic in my opinion because it is the mirror and reflex of an era.   1978's Thank God It's Friday obtained actually the Academy Award that Saturday Night Fever didn't get in 1977!  And both are pretty much about the same stuff.  However Saturday Night Fever focused more in the personal life of a dancer ("Tony", John Travota), but Thanks God It's Friday was made to focus in the common and real people having fun in the best Disco of the town, as we actually did in the discos at that time, with Tarzan included!.</p>
