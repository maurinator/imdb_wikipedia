<h1>The Killing (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After getting out of prison, Johnny Clay masterminds a complex race-track heist, but his scheme is complicated by the intervention of the wife of a teller (George Peatty) in on the scheme, the boyfriend of the wife, airport regulations, and a small dog.</p>
<p>Johnny Clay has a plan. After spending 5 years in Alcatraz, he decides that if he's going to commit crimes, the risk had better be worth the punishment. He then proceeds to mastermind a brilliant criminal scheme to steal $2,000,000 from a local racetrack in which "no one will get hurt." The only flaw in his plan is that he does not consider one of his co-horts' greedy, shrewish wife and her ruthless boyfriend. That's when something goes wrong...</p>
<p>Ex-convict Johnny Clay tells his girl friend, Fay, he has plans for making money, and indeed he has. He rounds up a gang and brings them in on a seemingly fool-proof scheme to rob a race track of $200,000. The first thread unravels when Sherry Peatty, wife of gang-member George Peatty, tells her boyfriend Val Cannon about the plan, and he cuts himself in on that action also. The robbery is completed and the gang goes to the hideout where Johnny will join them later. Val sticks up the robbers, a shot is fired, and all hands are soon dispatched. Johnny, with the money in a suitcase, joins Fay at the airport. And the fat lady still hasn't sung.</p>
<p>Crooks plan and execute a daring race-track robbery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stanley Kunbrick was still in his twenties when he made this film, yet his confidence and self-assurance are all over it.  It is a well-written story, co-written by Kubrick (based on a novel called "A Clean Break"), about a meticulously planned horetrack heist told from the point of view of the several people who were in on the plot.  Most of these guys weren't professional criminals, but otherwise honest men who were down on their luck and needed a break.  They turned to this audacious plan in desperation, thinking they could do some real good in their lives with their share of the money.  I won't give away the ending of course, but keep in mind this is a Kubrick film.  That's all I say about that.Standouts include Sterling Hayden as the ringleader, Marie Windsor as a snide, manipulative woman, Elisha Cook as her milquetoasty husband, Timothy Carey, as creepy as ever, and Kola Kwariani, the thinking man's Tor Johnson, as a chess expert/hired thug.Speaking of chess, this is the first movie I've ever seen with a scene taking place in a chess parlor.  Being from a provincial New England town, and not being a chess afficionado, I never knew such places existed.</p>
