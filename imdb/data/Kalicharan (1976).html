<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Shatrughan sinha debuts with a bang, quite literally with bullets flying in every alternate scene..A good block buster hit of 1976..Ablu supported by hamming Premnath, David and a good cameo by Danny denzongpa. This film marks directorial debut of Subhash Ghai and must surely be remembered for providing enough inspiration to a later Amitabh hit -DON! Salim Javed , thank Ghai who gave this hit 2 years earlier ... But here it is Shatrughan Sinha who does a double role , first time as hero. He is tough, with macho voice, a criminal with a heart of Gold who is inducted by IGP, Premnath to impersonate his dead son, Prabahkar because they are look alikes... Good action, Okay music , sharp screenplay and a cute Reena Roy makes this a watchable masala movie in all...</p>
