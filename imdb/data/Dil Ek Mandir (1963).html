<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dil Ek Mandir is a superb movie dealing with a triangular love story between Dharmesh ( Rajendra Kumar, Ram ( Raaj Kumar ) and Sita ( Meena Kumari) While Dharmesh and Sita were in love and was planned to become husband and wife, circumstances did not let that happen that way and Sita ended up marrying Ram while Dharmesh was abroad. The story starts with Ram brought by Sita to Dharmesh for treatment of cancer. The dialogue is just marvelleous and keeps you glued to the story. The entire movie is shot in one place - the hospital where Ram was waiting for his operation. This movie is probably one of Meena Kumari's stellar performances supported by equally great acting by both Rajendra Kumar and Raaj Kumar. The story is heart breaking you cannot stop crying when Ram asks Sita to marry Dharmesh if he dies after the operation which Ram thinks is a certainty. Also the final scene when Dharmesh finds that the operation was successful and Ram is going to live with Sita - Rajendra Kumar gave a magnificent performance. Dil Ek Mandir is a classic Meena Kumari movie where she played a tragedy queen role like many other movies where her performance will be remembered as a masterpiece. It is a must see.</p>
