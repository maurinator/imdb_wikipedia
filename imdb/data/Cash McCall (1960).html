<h1>Cash McCall (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cash McCall is a young and slick business man who buys failing businesses and resells them. Grant Austen's Plastics is even more of a prize to Cash, for Cash is also making a bid for Austen's beautiful daughter, Lory. This is Cash's toughest deal ever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my favorite movies as a child. Look at her face in the close-ups, when the movie flashes back to their meeting in the rain at his mountain cabin! Such a romantic movie, and Ms. Woods' clothes are fabulous examples of 50s high fashion. And Cash Mc Call's penthouse is a perfect high-tech palace for the times.Natalie has the doting parents we all wished we had back then and a mother who is worried this beautiful creature will be an old maid at 23. Ah, life was simple then.The business oriented plot is engaging, the dialogue springy and believable for the times. Though marraige and family are still the only acceptable goals for good girls in this story,  you don't care as you root for true love to conquor all and the cold business man to see the light and let the good guys win.Rent it, if you have never seen it. An underappreciated gem. I wish I had told Ms. Wood how much I liked the film, the one time I met her in the late sixties, but she was rather pregnant at the time and not terribly concerned with her career.</p>
