<h1>Irma Vep (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>French filmmaker Ren√© Vidal was once a renowned director, but most see his career on a quick downward slide based on his last several films. In Paris, he is just starting to film his latest movie, a remake of Les vampires (1915), and has hired Hong Kong based Chinese actress Maggie Cheung as the title lead, "Irma Vep" (an anagram for "vampire"), despite she knowing no French and she not being an obvious choice to most. Maggie has never worked with Vidal before and knows little about his movies, but many of his primarily French crew are part of his regular stable. As such, Maggie may become isolated among the cast and crew, unless there are those who bring her into their English conversations, they who may have somewhat ulterior motives in doing so. There are also factions within the cast and crew, who, based on their history, have a poisoned sense of what is going on. With Vidal, he is dealing with some personal issues while he tries to regain his film making form. He may transfer his thoughts of Irma Vep to Maggie, who he hired because he too sees her as strong and sexy like the skin-tight latex clad Irma. And Maggie may take her research for the comic bookish character to an extreme.</p>
<p>Rene Vidal, a director in decline, decides to remake Louis Feuillade's silent serial "Les Vampires." Believing no French actress can match Musidora as Irma Vep (an anagram for vampire), he casts Hong Kong action heroine Maggie Cheung, though she speaks no French. On the chaotic set, she's aided by Zoe, the wardrobe mistress with a crush on her; she defends Vidal to a Parisian journalist who trashes all French film and praises John Woo and Schwarzenegger; she befriends Vidal when he goes over the edge; and, in costume, she breaks into a hotel suite to steal jewels as her victim talks on the phone. We also watch the making, the rushes, and the remains of Vidal's unfinished film.</p>
<p>A Chinese movie actress, in France to star in a remake of "Les Vampires", finds petty intrigues and clashing egos on the set.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pretty much average. Except for Maggie. The movie tries to tell us of the pretensions that the French movies have but falls its self prey to the illness that the script attributes to French cinema: boringness and a desire to intellectualism. I don't think the movie really achieves in making its point. If anything, it doesn't have the wide appeal that it says French movies should have. On the other hand, the movie isn't all that bad. In fact, Maggie looks absolutely fabulous, having a natural look that she doesn't have in HK movies, and she seems to revel in the very realistic banter that goes on between her costume designer and herself. Did I mention that Maggie looks fabulous?</p>
