<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, I'll admit that the panda is cute, (although most of the time it's mechanical) but that's about all that this movie has. The story line is STUPID and the kid is really, really abrasive. I was hoping that the poachers would get him. I am a pre-teen (oh god, no!) and I still see several holes in the logic of this story. For example, why is it that the dad is climbing the mountain only a few hours after he got shot in the leg! Basically, no one over the age of three should be ALLOWED to watch this movie. It's demeaning to the entire population.</p>
