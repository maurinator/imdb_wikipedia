<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have never been a fan of Keanu Reeves. I decided to watch this movie because of the rest of the cast. Fred Ward, Bonnie Bedelia, Amy Madigan & J.O. Sanders are some of my favorite actor). So I figured I couldn't go wrong. I spent my time laughing out-loud for the better part of the show. I had never seen Fred Ward in a farcical comedy before but he was really good. Amy Madigan drew quite a few laughs, too. Even J.O. Sanders, who usually plays heavy parts came in for some chuckles. Bonnie Bedelia is always a joy to see. Keanu really surprised me. He was truly good in the part. There are quite a few tender moments but for the most part this is a seriously funny movie. 8 out of 10.</p>
