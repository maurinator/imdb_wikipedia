<h1>Pagliacci (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story is set in southern Italy and recounts the tragedy of Canio, the lead clown in a commedia dell'arte troupe, his wife Nedda, and her lover, Silvio.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The king of opera staging, Franco Zeffirelli, never disappoints. Not when it comes to bringing opera to the screen, in any case. Here, as in LA TRAVIATA, the fantastic pairing of Placido Domingo and the sublime Teresa Stratas is once again triumphant. I PAGLIACCI is a short, one act opera, usually paired with CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA. If viewing I PAGLIACCI alone leaves you hungry for more. Ms. Stratas is perhaps as gifted an actress as she is as a soprano. This is one of the few opportunities to see and hear this now retired soprano, one of the greatest of our time.</p>
