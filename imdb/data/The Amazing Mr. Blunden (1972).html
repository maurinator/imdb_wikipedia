<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very good family film; its only flaw is that it's a bit too long.  The film takes place in England, in approximately 1916.  A widow and her three children are left destitute on the husband's death. The mysterious Mr. Blunden shows up and offers the mother a caretaker's position at an old country mansion which was partially destroyed by a great fire decades ago. The family goes to live in a small cottage on the estate.  The two oldest children, Lucy and Jamie, are drawn into the unsolved mystery that surrounds the old fire.  They find out that the two heirs to the estate, a boy and girl, were killed in the fire, but it might have been murder and not an accident.  The film takes a fanciful twist at this juncture, sending Lucy and Jamie back in time to save the two orphaned kids.  Will they succeed? And what will it mean to their own lives if they do?  What does Mr. Blunden have to do with all this and why does he need Lucy and Jamie's help?  I can only say, rent the movie and find out.  It has a nice late Victorian air to it, and is steeped in atmosphere.  Older kids and adults will enjoy it; my entire family loves this movie.</p>
