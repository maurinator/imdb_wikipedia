<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A musical about teens in love in the 50's! It's California 1959 and greaser Danny Zuko and Australian Sandy Olsson are in love. They spend time at the beach, and when they go back to school, what neither of them knows is that they both now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black leather jacket-wearing greasers while Sandy hangs with the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo. When they clash at Rydell's first pep rally, Danny isn't the same Danny from the beach. They try to be like each other so they can be together.</p>
<p>Grease starts out with Danny and Sandy on the beach, where they have fallen in love during summer break. They seem so happy together (and they were), but Danny was expecting her to move back to Australia with her family. It turns out that she doesn't. On the first day of school, Sandy makes friends with the "Pink Ladies", a group of popular girls that are friends with Danny. During the first pep rally for the football team, the "Pink Ladies" introduce the two lovebirds, Danny and Sandy, where Danny treats Sandy very harshly, and rejects her and makes her angry. After the pep rally, the girls take Sandy to Frenchie's house. Danny and the guys decide to go to the diner, where he sees Sandy with a jock, so he decided to become a jock to impress her. He tries wrestling, gymnastics, baseball, and basketball, before joining the track team. Danny sort of wins back her heart, and they go to the diner, hoping to get away from his friends, but they discover them already there. Danny chooses to act, again, like his friends, and makes Sandy mad again. Danny and Sandy then go on a journey to find their true selves, and try to make their love last.</p>
<p>During a visit to America, Australian Sandy meets Danny Zuko at the beach and falls in love. She is heartbroken when summer ends and she has to return home and their last kiss on the beach is a very emotional one. But fate lends a hand -- her parents decide to stay in America and she finds herself attending the same school as Danny. But Danny at school is different from Danny at the beach. He is the leader of the T-Birds, a black leather-clad gang, and has a reputation to keep up. He can't be seen to fall in love with just one chick! Sandy is upset and seeks solace with some new friends she has made - a girls' club called The Pink Ladies. But her prim and proper virginal ways do not fit in and she soon finds herself almost alone. A change must be made. Does she attempt to get her man by turning him into a jock? Or must she get rid of her "Sandra Dee" image?</p>
<p>Sandy Olsen is a goody two shoes from Austrailia, Danny Zuko is the head T-Bird from Rydell High. However when the two meet up during the summer, they fall in love.

When the two discover that they attend the same school, there is a lot of debate over whether they can still be together since it's uncool for Danny to be in love with a goody goody like Sandy. However the two, against all odds, manage to stay together. Then graduation comes and Sandy is about to change in a way no one expected.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that. Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciate what a fun-loving view of life this provides. All the songs are of at least decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing. This is hands down one of the better musicals out there. The choreography can't be more well done than shown here. It's funny because I liked "Saturday Night Fever" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure. Olivia Newton-John is just gorgeous, why she didn't star in many movies afterward I'll never understand and god what a voice!!! John Travolta was great, and everyone else (especially Stockard Channing) were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to a Karaoke night make sure you do the "Grease Megamix" sometime throughout the night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final Synopsis:Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it. This is one you can view easily on the silver screen and enjoy it just as much for a lot cheaper.DVD Purchase : Couldn't resist for only $9.Rental : This could easily be a once a year habit.</p>
