<h1>Robin Hood (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Swashbuckling legend of Robin Hood unfolds in the 12th century when the mighty Normans ruled England with an iron fist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You won't have many surprises in the plot of this new Robin, but the twists and turns on the  old themes make this a surprisingly entertaining adventure. Bergin is excellent as Robin,  giving the character a dark and sexy flavor that is very appealing. Thurman is a willful,  `modern', but never unfeminine heroine. Unlike so many versions, this Robin uses a heavy,  lethal broadsword instead of a rapier, and the fights are violent and convincing. I wouldn't  want to do without the Flynn version, but I am very happy to have found this new, fresh and  lively edition.</p>
