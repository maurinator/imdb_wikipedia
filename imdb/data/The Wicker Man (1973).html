<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The bizarre and chilling tale of a fool chosen to be king for a day.The shocking denouement of this film has stayed with me for many years, far longer than scenes or images from more famous films.  A classic of its kind, it deserves the re-release it will probably never get.Superficially a mystery thriller, this intelligent and well researched story delves into the beliefs and rituals of Ancient Britain, its folk mythologies and music, and reveals some of the un-settling fears that lie at their root.  Set on a remote Scottish Island and giving the appearance of being a Whisky Galore, Local Hero type community, there is yet something off-centre about the townspeople that Edward Woodward, as Sergeant Howie, has come to investigate.  The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent, commanding Lord of the Isle, gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall.  He is perfect in the role.The story un-folds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, as the dogged Howie gets led all over town, up one blind alley and down another.  Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on, but we don't heed them.  Until it's too late.  Too late to walk away.The standard video version runs for 85 minutes, cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence.  A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes.  The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.However, whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film.  See it yourself and you too will have many meetings with 'The Wicker Man', in your dreams, in the dark, where you cannot escape.</p>
