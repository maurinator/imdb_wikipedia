<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very good story. Very few actors on the screen. No songs and yet this movie is a great suspense thriller. Nanda looks very sexy in this movie. She is vulnerable and voluptuous. Rajesh Khanna is does a different kind of role. Overall a must see. Turn off the lights and enjoy.</p>
