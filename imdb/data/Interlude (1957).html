<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A propos of "when tomorrow comes" ,of which "interlude" is the remake: This is not one of Stahl's best works.The movie lacks a center of gravity. Melodrama interferes with social topics(unions,strikes,meetings)and even a deluge,complete with a night in a temple.Besides,the Madeleine character appears too late and is hardly credible.She suffers from mental illness since she lost her child.And the unfortunate heroine tells her so:"you win because you're helpless". Charles Boyer plays the usual Latin lover,and Irene Dunne,the impossible love ,as she did in Fannie Hurst's famous tear-jerker. The ending is ambiguous:in his 1957 remake,the by now usual Sirk remake has a more definitive conclusion. All in all,watchable,because of the cast ,but not a great Stahl. A propos of "interlude" : Generally Sirk used to work wonders with his remakes of John M Stahl: "magnificent obsession" and 'imitation of life" (in spite of some reservations for the latter) were ,in several respects ,superior to the thirties works ;"interlude" ,on the other hand ,is less interesting than the original,which was not a masterpiece either.Gone are the social concern,the hurricane and the flood -replaced by a little storm- We're left with an old maid (June Allyson whose performance is mediocre and no romantic at all )two suitors (an Italian buck and a handsome American physician ),plus a depressive woman ,which makes some of the final scenes look like an updated Jane Eyre .It's extraordinary that this bland soap opera should precede ,in Sirk 's filmography ,his absolute masterpiece " a time to love and a time to die" which cannot be praised too highly: one finds it hard to believe that the two movies were made by the same director.French users will notice the presence of Fran√ßoise Rosay as the housekeeper.</p>
