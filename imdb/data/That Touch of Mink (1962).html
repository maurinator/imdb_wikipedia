<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Cathy Timberlake is an old fashioned country girl who meets the man of her dreams, Philip Shayne, after his Rolls Royce splashes her with mud on her way to a job interview. Philip is a romantic businessman who is taken by Cathy's honest heart. There's one problem, he's not interested in marriage while Cathy has never thought of anything else.</p>
<p>On a rainy day, currently unemployed working girl Cathy Timberlake is furious when a passing limousine, driving through a puddle, splashes her resulting in her dress and raincoat to get all muddy. She is even more furious when the limousine fails to stop, even though she knows the limo's passenger saw her get splashed. She changes her tune when she later meets that passenger, dashing and wealthy businessman Philip Shayne. Cathy is immediately attracted to him and he to her. However, ladies' man Philip is much more experienced than her, and she is unprepared for his lavish and elaborate proposal - that she accompany him immediately to Bermuda, Paris and Monte Carlo - and its connotation that it hold no strings. Cathy turns to her streetwise roommate, Connie Emerson, for advice. As Philip and Cathy's whirlwind relationship progresses, Cathy's hesitance to go all the way for what Philip wants always seems to lead to frustration for Philip. Despite Philip and Cathy not seeming to make a full connection with each other due to Cathy's actions, Roger, Philip's business associate, believes Cathy is just what Philip needs in his life as Philip has always had the luxury of never having had to work to get a woman. Although Cathy really does want to be with Philip and as Philip really wants to be with Cathy, will they be able to get over these initial obstacles?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Question: Name the film where Art Passarella, famous baseball umpire, tosses out five celebrities from a game.Answer: THAT TOUCH OF MINK. Passarella tosses out Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Yogi Berra, Cary Grant, and Doris Day from a game, because of some rule infraction caused by Day (who is in the dugout with the others during a game), and then for escalating reasons in which the three Yankees deny any infraction.The reason Doris and Cary are in the dugout is that they are attending a Yankee Game (Cary has some stock in the Yankees - this film was in the period before George Steinbrenner took control of the baseball team.Grant is a multi-millionaire whose limousine has damaged Days' clothing by spraying her when the car went through a puddle. He (at first) just wants to repair the damage but he slowly falls for her. But Day is acting like ... well like Day usually does; She is a NYC career woman, and does not want to be the victim of hanky-panky from any man. She is egged on in this by her closest friend, Audrey Meadows. Grant slowly uses his considerable economic muscles to get Day to agree to a trip to the Caribbean, but he finds having her there is not the same thing as getting to know her physically there.This film is loaded with nice bits by the supporting players. One of the other reviews points out John Astin as an obnoxious suitor for Day, whom (at the end) she does willingly go out to a motel in New Jersey with, only to have him fail to score when Grant shows up. But also see this for Gig Young, as Grant's secretary, who finds that Grant's effortless economic and social success are undermining Young's delicate mental balance. See it too for Alan Hewitt, as Young's therapist, who finds that it really pays to have Young as a client (because of all the great stock market tips the naive secretary blabs to the Doctor). Their last moment on screen together is quite funny, when Young is gushing over the baby he is watching (actually Grant and Day's child) and Hewitt is momentarily left thinking that somehow Young and Grant had a baby together. Finally, the late John Fiedler has a good moment as a newlywed husband who concludes that a man's best friend is his mother.An easy to take Day sex romp, I recommend it for the amusement it generates. The baseball trivia connection is also a reason (though a minor one) to watch the film at least once.</p>
