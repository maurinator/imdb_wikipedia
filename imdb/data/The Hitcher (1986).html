<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A cat spends the day chasing a mouse.  When he finally corners the mouse, he takes sadistic delight in batting it around, playing with it before it goes in for the kill.  The cat wishes to savor the look of fear on its prey, instead of merely indulging the reward it's worked so hard to catch.  This is the predator/prey relationship evidenced in "The Hitcher," one of the most relentlessly intense and mean-spirited horror films ever made.Since the setting is the desert, I suppose it would make more sense to call John Ryder (played by Rutger Hauer) a vicious coyote, who is picked up one rainy night by a stray lamb named Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell).  Ryder, who's apparently been murdering people all over the desert, is looking to do the same with Halsey, who cheats death only to be tormented for the rest of the film by this savage predator.  The coyote craves a challenge--in fact, he seems to live for it.Nothing else needs to be said.  "The Hitcher" relies so heavily on a plot that weaves in and out of 'the expected' that any further description would spoil the fun.  The two leads are excellent--Rutger Hauer has created one of the great villains of modern cinema, and C. Thomas Howell is a sympathetic and believable victim driven to madness.  While the film isn't necessarily deep, the high-energy cast, moody desert settings and twisty script fuel this effort for 98 intense minutes.  3.5 stars out of 5.</p>
