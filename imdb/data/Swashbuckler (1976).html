<h1>Swashbuckler (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A pirate and a hot-tempered noblewoman join forces to protect Jamaica from a tyrant.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite Maltin's great slagging-off of this movie (has he actually seen it, I wonder??), I reckon it was a little gem in an era when a lot of filmmakers took themselves and their work far too seriously!  Guaranteed to lift the blues on any bad day, it may be a bit corny, it might have been misguided to make a pirate flick in the mid-70s, but there are certainly a lot worse examples of the genre around, and this one is quite a cute and appealing film.</p>
