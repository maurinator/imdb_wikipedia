<h1>Dog Soldiers (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A British Squad is sent on a training mission in the Highlands of Scotland against Special Operations squad. Ignoring the childish "campfire" stories heard about the area, they continue with their mission and come across the bloody remains of the Special Ops Squad, and a fierce howling is pitching the night sky... With two mortally wounded men, they make an escape, running into a zoologist by the name of Megan - who knows exactly what hunts them. What began as what they thought was a training mission turns into a battle for their lives against the most unlikely enemies they would have expected - werewolves.</p>
<p>A squad of British soldiers on training in the lonesome Scottish wilderness find a wounded Special Forces captain and the carnaged remains of his team. As they encounter zoologist Megan, it turns out that werewolves are active in the region. They have to prepare for some action as there will be a full moon tonight...</p>
<p>Sent on basic manoeuvres in the deep, dark forests of Scotland, a band of British Tommie's find themselves hunted, trapped and waiting for the long night to reach its end. With werewolves abound in this gripping, claustrophobic, high-octane nightmare of the worse scenario; with time running out, hope running thin and chances slipping away it begs the questions: Who can be trusted? Who will survive?</p>
<p>Imagine you're leading a six man squad on a routine army exercise. You're behind enemy lines. Your radio doesn't work. You're cut off and on foot in a vast, hostile wilderness. You hear somthing howling in the distance. Something's out there.. and it's hungry. Very hungry. And hairy.. very hairy. The sun is going down. And there's a full moon. You're missing the most important football match of the decade. And there's every chance that you're about to be eaten alive by a pack of vicious, snarling, blood-lusting, seven-foot tall werewolves. What do you do?</p>
<p>A routine military exercise turns into a nightmare in the Scotland wilderness.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Exciting and thoroughly well-made werewolf film from Scotland delivers the goods to both horror and action fans!A band of soldiers go into the Scotland country for a training exercise and instead find themselves struggling to survive against a horde of werewolves!Writer/director Neil Marshall does a knock-out job with creating a solid werewolf film that packs on plenty of quick suspense and steely action. Marshall's story is always gripping, building to an explosive climax. He's obviously a genre fan as he references a number of old-school horror films in the process, even naming one character after B movie hero Bruce Campbell. The direction is right on too with plenty of atmospheric spookiness, as well as a feeling of complete claustrophobia even in the sprawling woods! The special FX come off pretty good and provides for more than a few gory scenes.The cast isn't half bad, hero Kevin McKidd (dearly departed Tommy from Trainspotting) and Sargent Sean Pertwee being the best.This film may have flown under the horror radar back in 2002, but genre fans should discover just how good this film is. Dog Soldiers is a movie that lets us know that the monster flick is not dead!*** out of ****</p>
