<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>La Planète sauvage is a fantastic sci-fi movie. The story is great. Its about a planet called Ygam, where human-like creatures called Oms live as pets for a race of blue giants known as the Traags. An Om steals a Traag knowledge device and helps the other Oms revolt. This is just the beginning of this fantastic tale. Even tough the animation is only okay, the fantastic drawings are perfectly suited to this exceptional movie. They are beautiful are alone worth the price(and time) that will give you the chance to see this extraordinary film, but the story is also exceptional. Its hard to find but its worth it.10 out of 10. An animation masterpiece.</p>
