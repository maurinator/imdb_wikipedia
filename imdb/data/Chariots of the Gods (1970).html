<h1>Chariots of the Gods (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Documentary based on the book by Erich Von Daniken concerning the ancient mysteries of the world, such as the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, ancient cave drawings, the monuments of Easter Island, etc. and the fact that these things and modern civilization could have been influenced by extra-terrestrial visitations hundreds(or perhaps thousands) of years ago.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fascinating tour of the world in search of hieroglyphic statements, cuneiform writings, and extremely heavy objects that were purportedly moved by extraterrestrial beings when they visited Earth.Daniken's explanations may suggest how the pyramids were constructed in Egypt and the means by which the heavy statues of Easter Island arrived at their current sites all over the island.In any event, it is fascinating to see aerial views of landing fields which extraterrestrial visitors may have fashioned for their purposes.Virtually all continents seem to offer proof of such other worldly visitors.It is a wonderful trip around the world.  The cinematography is good.Entertaining for those interested in far away places as well as for scientists.</p>
