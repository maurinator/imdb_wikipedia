<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vittorio Gassman, married to Eleanor Parker and living in Italy, is innocently introduced one day to a schoolkid with pigtails and a goofy grin. Years later, that schoolgirl has become a wanton young woman. She ensnares the married man and plays him like a flute, but how serious is she? He finds himself desirous of her on-again/off-again charms, calling her on the phone in the middle of the night, getting himself in deeper and deeper. Such is the crux of this middle-age-crazy romance-that-really-isn't. It's a thoughtful Italian-made 'dramedy' that attempts to give its characters some dignity (even Ann-Margret's somewhat viporous role isn't all one shade). The low budget and occasional dubbing shouldn't put off fans of the stars. They're worth-watching here in what would make a great double-bill with A-M's similarly-titled "Kitten With A Whip". **1/2 from ****</p>
