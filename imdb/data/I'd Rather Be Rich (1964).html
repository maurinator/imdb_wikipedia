<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film again recently, and had forgotten just how good it is. Pure entertainment, and a true "Hollywood-type" story and setting. Nostalgiac to see Goulet and Williams (now in their 70's) and Sandra Dee, recently lost, in their younger years - along with Chevalier and Gingold, who were as enjoyable as they were together in "Gigi." Ruggles and Jenkins remind us of their fine character performances in films past. The relatively few comments for this film describe details of it entertaining aspects very well. Having lived in southwest Missouri, near Branson, for a number of years, I had occasion to see Andy Williams performing at his theater a number of times, and at some other events in the area. His theater is a magnificent building, constructed by him with his own funds, with outstanding art and collectibles - a tasteful edifice in Branson, where most theaters, while modern, and comfortable with state-of-the-art systems, don't score too high in the "taste" department. I haven't been there for a few years, since moving, and I know he has shortened his personal performance schedule somewhat. But all productions there were classy and reminiscent of his quality t.v. show. One interesting and perfectly-produced segment which I saw there the last two times I visited involved this film. In the scene where he and Sandra Dee are driving to the estate, and he is singing "Almost There," he had produced a depiction of himself - with gray hair, and 30 years older than his character doing the driving - running after the car. He then enters the car, actually sitting with Sandra and "himself" 30-years younger, dark hair and all. This had to be seen to be fully-appreciated, but it was as well-produced as any special effect from, say, Spielberg - and provided about 5 minutes or so of superb entertainment when shown on his giant screen. As I recall, he also "sang with himself," seamlessly integrated into the activity. This was not only enjoyable in its own right - but displayed graphically the time span this man's talent has prevailed. Andy is one of those singers/performers (Tony Bennett is another) whose charisma and quality of performance did not diminish with the passing years. And this film is an example, not only of a piece of fine entertainment, viewed for itself, per se - - but also to enjoy reflecting on the nostalgia for its period when it was originally presented.</p>
