<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An off-screen narrator, Mort Golden, takes us back to winter around 1975, the year he was 21. He and his two buddies, Tim and Danny, have a fateful trip over the bridge from Detroit into Canada. The three of them are going nowhere in life, although Mort has thoughts of being a writer, while his mom wants him to go to college. He and his pals contemplate making a quick fortune transporting drugs over the border in their beat-up Buick, "the war wagon." Mort's also hopelessly in love with a girl he dated briefly a couple years before. With border inspectors, Tim's temper, and Danny's bottled up emotions, is there any way this can end well?</p>
<p>The adventures of three teenage friends in 1970s Detroit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I didn't think this movie would be that good since it has Jason Gedric and Stephen Baldwin as main characters, but I was surprised and really like this movie.  Gedric plays the role of the ex-football star from high school who works at a gas station after graduating, and Gedric's performance was phenomenal; his portrayal of the character was perfection.  Baldwin was ok, and Josh Charles, the guy from the great underated tv show "Sports Night", was pretty good also.  The best scene in the movie is where Gedric gets into a fight with some younger guys from his hometown.</p>
