Nevertheless, he meets his dream woman. She won't have anything to do with him. Is fate unkind?Saul Rubinek is charming and funny as Allan. He handles all of his dating woes with a wistful humor. Marcia Strassman is also wonderful as the longed-for lady. Yes, there is an R rating attached to this movie for a few sexual scenes that go out of bounds. Hopeless romantics may have to hit the fast button on the remote now and again. The funny script and performers, though, carry this winning film.
