<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance.  The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film.  None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone.  I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but he should have definitely passed on this one.The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done.  Save this one for last though.Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did.  Thanks for reading.</p>
