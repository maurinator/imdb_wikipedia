<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just as fresh today as when I first saw it in 1982, this movie is in a class by itself because it explores a topic that is rarely discussed anywhere: cures for diseases that the public doesn't know about. Director Michael Miller gives us a science fiction movie mixed with chiller dementia. I will never forget the first time I saw this in the theaters. From beginning to end my eyes were glued to the screen. Brian Libby's maniac is one of the most realistic madmen you will ever see. The score by Peter Bernstein and Mark Goldenberg is wicked, especially in the opening credits. Some of the murders in this movie are downright brutal. Chuck Norris does a good job as the Texas lawman on the case, while Ron Silver and Steven Keats are spectacular as two doctors bickering over medical ethics. The international poster for this movie is one of the most chilling one's I've ever seen. I hope there's a sequel in the works.Score, 9 out of 10 Stars</p>
