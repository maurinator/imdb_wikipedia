<h1>Lost in America (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David and Linda Howard are successful yuppies from LA. When he gets a job disappointment, David convinces Linda that they should quit their jobs, liquidate their assets, and emulate the movie Easy Rider, spending the rest of their lives travelling around America...in a Winnebago! (This is a kind of large, luxurious mobile home which suits a 1980's yuppie more than the counterculture dropout approach of Easy Rider.) His idealized, unrealistic plans soon begin to go spectacularly wrong.</p>
<p>A husband and wife in their 30s decide to quit their jobs, live as free spirits and cruise America in a Winnebago.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After reading the reviews I couldn't believe that there are people that found this movie boring. To me it has some of the best dialog in any movie.Favorite scene? hard to pick, but probably when Albert Brooks comes down to the casino in his bathrobe looking for Julie Haggerty and finds her chanting..."22,22,22,22." When asked how down she is she says "Down." When asking the casino operator how down she is he says "Down."Another player says "She really likes 22"I have seen this movie over and over again and it just keeps getting funnier each time I see it. I am a big Albert Brooks fan, Defending your life is very good and Real Life is also a favorite.If you like dry humor and great dialog see this one for sure!</p>
