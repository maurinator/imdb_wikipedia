<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is definately Steven Seagal's best movie. This movie is definately worth a look. The supporing cast like Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey make very good villans. Jones did a great job as the half insane mercinary who's in on a plot of hijacking a U.S. Battleship. There are a lot of actors in this one who would appear in director Andrew Davis's next film "The Fugitive" The action in this movie is great. I think this movie also contains some good cinematography by Frank Tidy. This is not a movie you can take seriously. You have to use your imagination and know it's not real but pretend it is. *** out of ****</p>
