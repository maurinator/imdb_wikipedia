<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the problems caused by what became known as the Conscripton Crisis in 1917 Canada, which threatened to divide the country.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Two Solitudes" is the story of early Canada and the people who settled it.It is set during WW1, and a cast of "archetype" characters relay the story, being representations of French Canadians or Catholics or Businessmen during this time period. However, the characters and the acting in this movie is more than strong enough to make you forgot this fact, at least initially.Each character drives the story forward, and is based on how these characters (archetypes) respond to each other.Depressing, but a very effective look into the early life of Canada.9/10.</p>
