<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Actually,to correct what another reviewer said(wanting also to correct a supposed error,but making a mistake),the anime "Lady Oscar(Rose of Versailles)" came AFTER the movie(that means almost an year after the movie was made) and WAS ALSO TARGETED TOWARDS THE CHILDREN.So,the movie is based ONLY upon the manga and NOT AT ALL upon the anime.Also,the "historical clichés" aren't "cliches",but REAL HISTORICAL FACTS and I really don't see why the movie shouldn't present them,like the manga did,too. To talk about the movie,as a Lady Oscar's fan,I would consider it somehow average.It has some good-or even very good-parts(the costumes,the sets,the music,some aspects of the play of some characters-I disagree with someone who said that the acting is "incredibly weak all around",because it's clearly not like that!) and some more bad parts(the way in which most of the characters were presented,different from the ones in the original story,the fact that some important events in the story aren't showed at all,the play of some actors,the ending which is an almost complete nonsense).But,in the end,it's,like I said,it's an average movie,though enough fans are,quite rightfully,disappointed of it.</p>
