Falling in with three longer-serving hopefuls he is soon immersed in the wooing, imbibing and fast sports-car driving that constitute 1950's medical training.

<p>Simon Sparrow arrives at St. Swinthin's Hospital to begin 5 long years of study in order to become a doctor. From his first day, it's obvious that the studious and somewhat inexperienced Sparrow is going to have a series of humorous adventures. He has some difficulty findings lodgings where the landlady's daughter isn't out to seduce him. He's finally taken in by two fellow students, Richard Grimsdyke and Tony Benskin, old hands who didn't pass their exams the first time around. Aside from the normal trials and tribulations of being medical students - in this case in the form of senior physician Sir Lancelot Spratt - Simon has had little luck in the romance department. His chums talk him into going out with nurse Joy Gibson but Simon isn't keen. Love is often found in the strangest places. As the years go by, Simon becomes a quite competent doctor must along with his pals, has to face the hurdle of final exams.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the funniest movies from my youth, and I still love it completely.  Dirk Bogarde is marvelous as the medical student with an incredibly bad streak of luck.  Kenneth More steals every scene in which he appears.  James Robertson Justice is hilarious as Sparrow's venerable mentor.</p>
