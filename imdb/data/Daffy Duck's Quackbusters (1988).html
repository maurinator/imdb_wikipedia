<h1>Daffy Duck's Quackbusters (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this feature-length film combining footage from classic Warner Brothers cartoon shorts with newly animated bridging sequences, Daffy Duck, after having induced laughter in an ailing millionaire and forestalled the millionaire's death for a time (as chronicled in Daffy Dilly (1948), is the beneficiary for the deceased millionaire's assets. But the millionaire's will clearly stipulates that Daffy must use the money for the common good, by providing a service, and should Daffy think of pursuing selfish aims, the millionaire's ghost will "repossess" his millions by making them disappear from Earthly existence. Under the pretense of community service, Daffy opens an exorcism agency and employs Porky Pig, Sylvester Cat, and Bugs Bunny to track and eliminate ghosts, ghouls, and other monsters, while Daffy secretly schemes to use his learned "ghost-busting" talents to rid himself of the millionaire's nagging spirit.</p>
<p>Daffy Duck opens a detective agency for the supernatural along side his Looney Toon buddies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this final installment of the compilation series, we go out with a bang. Once again, Daffy takes center stage in this clever and funny takeoff on "Ghost Busters" with Daffy, Bugs, Porky and Sylvester taking on everybody from killer mice to evil vampires.This movie is, quite simply, funny. It is a great spoof of the 1984 comedy classic (not so much a spoof of the story as it is the idea) and most of the cartoons included are some of the funniest among the Looney Tunes canon. Particular highlights include "Daffy's Dilly" and "Prize Pest." Greg Ford and Terry Lennon wisely use vintage sound effects and music cues from the original cartoon and also provide a surprisingly catchy and somber instrumental version of "Monsters Lead Such Interesting Lives" with the full song being sung superbly by Mel Torme.Unfairly dismissed as just another cheap clip show "Quackbusters" is clever, entertaining, funny, and also poignant when one considers this was Mel Blanc's final Looney Tunes movie performance. Another highlight is a great cameo appearance by the forgotten Tune Egghead which provides a nice touch for film buffs.What it boils down to is that this film is fine family entertainment and is a quality spoof (take note Friedburg and Seltzer). If nothing else, it is at least better than "Ghostbusters II."</p>
