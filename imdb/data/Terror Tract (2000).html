<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bob Carter (John Ritter), a suburban real estate agent, tries to get a kindly couple, Allen and Mary Ann Doyle, to buy a house only to give them horrifying stories about the pasts of three of them.What really sells this film is the "before they were stars" appeal of it. The "Nightmare" segment features Wade Williams years before his big break on "Prison Break".The "Bobo" segment features Bryan Cranston, just as he was hitting it big with "Malcolm in the Middle" and years before "Breaking Bad" made him an A-list star.And the "Come to Granny" segment has Brenda Strong, who was already quite successful, but this was again years before her biggest role: on "Desperate Housewives".Beyond that, it is a slightly above average horror film. Nothing like a "lost treasure", but definitely worth checking out.</p>
