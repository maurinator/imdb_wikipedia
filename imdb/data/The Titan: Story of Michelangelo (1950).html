<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Interesting, informative, and filled with historical and visual detail, this documentary is a very good summary of the life, times, and art of Michelangelo.  Quite a bit is packed into a little more than an hour, and yet the pace always gives you a chance to keep up and to absorb what you learn about each stage of his life.  Fredric March's narration works quite well, holding your attention while always keeping the focus on the subject matter and not on the narrator.It does a very good job of placing the great artist in the context of his era, using cultural and historical background to help you better understand both him and his work.  There is a lot of detail shown from Michelangelo's various works, and it really impresses upon you his vast array of artistic accomplishments.  Despite being filmed in black-and-white, the visuals are interesting and generally effective.  Overall, it's nicely done and definitely worth watching if you're interested in the subject.</p>
