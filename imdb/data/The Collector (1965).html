<h1>The Collector (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Freddie, a socially withdrawn bank clerk and butterfly collector, decides to expand to collecting human specimens. That's where art student Miranda Grey comes in. Miranda matches wits with Freddie the icy psychopath.</p>
<p>Freddie Clegg isn't sure if he can carry out his plan for "her" until he stumbles across an isolated house for sale in the English countryside, the house he spots while he's butterfly collecting. The "her" is London based art student Miranda Grey, the plan to kidnap and hold her captive. Much like he loves his butterflies, Freddie loves Miranda, but from afar. In his mind, his love for her is based on respect for her as a person and not physical lust. So when he does manage to kidnap her and hold her hostage in the basement of his newly purchased house, she, not knowing who he is, is surprised that he is neither looking for ransom money or to sexually assault or rape her. He tries to respect her wishes except the most important wish of letting her go. As she tries to understand what he wants from her, they negotiate the terms of her captivity. All the while, she tries how best to escape while maintaining her safety while in the precarious position of being captive.</p>
<p>After winning a large amount in the pool in Reading, the outcast bank clerk and entomologist Freddie Clegg buys an isolated house in the countryside. He stalks the art student Miranda Grey in London and uses chloroform to kidnap and bring her in his van to his house. The sociopath Freddie locks Miranda in the cellar and she discovers that he has had an unrequited crush on her since they were teenagers. Freddie promises to respect Miranda with his platonic love and to release her in a month on June, 11th. He shows also his collection of butterflies carefully kept in a room. However, Miranda feels that she is another collectable species only for the deranged man that feels power and control with the situation ans he has no intention to let her go.</p>
<p>Freddie is an inept bank clerk with no future. His only hobby is collecting butterflies, which gives him a feeling of power and control that is otherwise totally missing from his life.

Still unable to make himself at ease socially, he starts to plan on acquiring a girl friend - in the same manner as he collects butterflies. He prepares the cellar of the house to be a collecting jar, and stalks his victim over several days.</p>
<p>A man kidnaps a woman and holds her hostage just for the pleasure of having her there.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Classic psychological suspense. The Collector creates sympathy and understanding for Clegg,a shy,impotent bank clerk who wins a fortune in a football pool that enables him to carry out his plan to kidnap Miranda, an art student. Miranda becomes his prisoner, and Clegg believes his captive will fall in love with him once she gets to know him. Miranda comes to realize that she has become an object to be collected,like Clegg's butterflies. Ironically, Miranda matures in her prison. It becomes a struggle between life(art/Miranda) and death(the collection/Clegg). Wyler's film is a true tour de force. He sustains the film with basically 2 characters;no gimmicks or diversions. Excellent performances. Stamp and Eggar are beautifully matched. And the ending is genuinely chilling. Though overused,the music is effective. 9/10</p>
