<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a true story of the Alfred Dreyfus indictment and imprisonment of an innocent man who loved his country.  Dreyfus was a Jew in the French army and that is probably the main reason he was persecuted and found guilty of treason.  The man was innocent but sent to Devil's Island anyway. He finally was released and his honor restored. His living relative (actor Richard Dreyfus) made a film of this tragedy and it is without a doubt one of the best films I've watched lately. Be sure to watch them both because this is history.</p>
