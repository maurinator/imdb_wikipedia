<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is freakin' awesome!  I saw this movie in the theatre the other day and was surprised that there was not that many people.  For this kind of movie you wouldn't think the acting was good but it was!  Lets just say the action in it is incredible and the plot isn't to bad either, just a little confusing.  Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu are great fighters in this movie and so is Ray Park (fight scene with him is awesome).  This is a great movie for everybody.  It should of been rated PG-13.  There's nothing bad in it.  Trust me!   It's worth the money.</p>
