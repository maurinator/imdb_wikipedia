<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Innocent cowboys, including Cameron Mitchell and Jack Nicholson, stop for food and rest at a cabin that unknown to them, is the hideout for a group of outlaws.Soon they find themselves on the run from a vicious hanging party and having to take teenage Millie Perkins and her family hostage in order to buy themselves some time.Good performances, direction by Monte Hellman, and an unbelievably tense script by Jack Nicholson help make this a thriller worth watching.The finale is absolutely heart-wrenching!A great independent western filmed simultaneously with The Shooting (also with Nicholson and Perkins), this is considered the lesser of the two, though not by much. Both films are fantastic.</p>
