<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As others have mentioned, this isn't a "story-telling" movie. The thin plot concerns Leroy "Horsemouth" Wallace's purchase and loss of a motorbike, but the real value of this movie is as a snapshot of real life in Jamaica, outside of the tourist resorts. Most of the movie takes place in an urban setting (presumably Kingston, although part of the movie seems to take place in Ocho Rios) and this is really one of the closest looks you're ever going to get at the life of Jamaica's poor, working class musicians without going to Kingston in person. The musical performances are top-notch (especially a stunning a capella rendition of "Jah No Dead" by Burning Spear) and Horsemouth actually makes a pretty good actor, filled with righteous indignation as he goes after the "Mafia boy" who "t'ief" his bike. A must-see for any fan of Jamaican music or admirer or Jamaican culture.</p>
