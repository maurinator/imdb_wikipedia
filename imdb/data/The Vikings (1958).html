<p>In the Middle Ages, Viking warriors continue to raid the English coast. In one such raid the Viking leader Ragnar kills the English king and forces himself on the Queen. With the King dead, his brother takes the throne but unknown to anyone but a trusted servant, the Queen is now with child. In order to protect the boy, he is sent away to be raised in safety away from the new King. Twenty years later, the Vikings under are still raiding England and they now have an Englishman, Egbert, making maps of the English coast for them.

Egbert realizes from a necklace Eric wears that he is the son of the Queen and is Einar's half-brother. When they kidnap Morgana, a Welsh beauty and the English King's betrothed, the stage is set for an inevitable clash between the half-brothers and with the reigning English King.</p>
<p>A slave and a Viking prince fight for the love of a captive princess.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Call me a fool, but I feel strongly that the Richard Fleischer/ Kirk Douglas 1958 film THE VIKINGS is a waiting-to-be-rediscovered masterpiece.Of the costume drama spectaculars of the 1950s-1960s, it has the most coherent script and theme.  It knowledgeably explores the themes Europe was dealing with during its Dark Ages.  Acting performances are first rate (Frank Thring's villainy drips pure acid), and the photography is breathtaking.  Mario Nacimbene's score has a majesty that matches any, including its little love theme.  See it (if possible) on the big screen/wide screen format.</p>
