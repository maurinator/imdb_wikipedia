<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Commando is the ultimate in cheesy one-liners.  Throughout this whole movie Schwarzenegger is at his utmost best.  The movie brings action at you thru the whole damn thing.  Bennett is the silliest bad guy to ever grace the big screen, not only is he small in stature, but he is the least intimidating bad guy ever.  Still he makes up for it, as you might guess, in his one-liners. If you want mindless action and unintentionally laughable humor, watch Commando and I GUARANTEE you will enjoy it.  A 5.5 on the votes is ludicrous, 8.8. NO LESS</p>
