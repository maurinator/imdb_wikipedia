<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a wonderful, heart-warming film! It is funny, sweet, honest, and touching. If as a child you experienced divorce or some other circumstance that placed you in a non- traditional family environment, you will appreciate this film. If you grew up without turmoil and without experiencing loss or the pain of divorce/death of a parent, you may not relate to the subject matter of this film (like some of the other IMDb users who deemed it unwatchable or boring). Oh yeah, and it doesn't contain any explosions. It's not that type of film.</p>
