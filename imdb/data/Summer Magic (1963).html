<h1>Summer Magic (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Disney musical about Mother Carey, a Bostonian widow and her three children who move to Maine. Postmaster Osh Popham helps them move into a run-down old house and fixes it up for them. It's not entirely uninhabited, though; the owner, a Mr. Hamilton, is a mysterious character away in Europe, but Osh assures them he won't mind their living there, since he won't be coming home for a long time yet. The children and a cousin who comes to live with them have various adventures before an unexpected visitor shows up.</p>
<p>This movie is a remake and somewhat loosely based on an old 1938 movie called Mother Carey's Chickens starring Ruby Keeler and Anne Shirley. I watched Summer Magic for years and just stumbled on this fact when I happened to watch the older movie!</p>
<p>A Bostonian widow moves with her kids to the country.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a remake of a movie called Mother Carey's Chickens (1938) Anne Shirley as Nancy Carey, Ruby Keeler as Kitty Carey, James Ellison as Ralph Thurston, Fay Bainter as Mrs. Carey, Walter Brennan as Mr. Popham, and Donnie Dunagan as Peter Carey.Both are really good family movies.  Summer Magic is more on the musical end and Mother Carey's Chickens is more of the romance side.  Both have a lot of love, kindness and care one for another.</p>
