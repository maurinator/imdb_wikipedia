<h1>Master of the Flying Guillotine (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The one-armed boxer is stalked by a vengeful flying guillotine expert, after his disciples were killed in the first 'One-Armed Boxer' film. But as the flying guillotine master is blind, he starts his quest by becoming a serial killer of one-armed men. Meanwhile, the one-armed boxer is running a martial arts school, where he teaches his pupils to control their breath so they can run up walls and along ceilings. And there's an Indian fakir whose arms can extend until they're ten feet long. As you may have gathered, a rational plot summary is pretty pointless - but rest assured there are epic martial arts battles and ludicrously inspired moments galore.</p>
<p>Fu Sing Wu Chi is the blind teacher of the two Ching assassins, Chow Lung and Chow Fu, killed by the One Armed Boxer a few years earlier. He also happens to be a master of the most deadly of all weapons, the flying guillotine. When Fu receives word of their death he immediately heads off to find Liu. Unfortunately, in the process he kills any one armed man in he comes in contact with. Aiding him in his search are a Thai boxer and an Indian fakir, who has the power of extending his arms. Also complicating matters is a Japanese karate expert, who has designs on the daughter of a martial arts teacher who also was killed by the vengeful Fu.</p>
<p>After his students are killed by the One Armed Boxer, a vengeful and blind Kung Fu expert travels to a village where a martial arts contest is being held and vows to behead every one armed man he comes across.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fun one.  Master of the Flying Guillotine sets up the vengeance angle and then, it's pure fights from there on.  Besides Flying Guillotine and the One Armed Swordsman, you've got a martial arts tournament to boot!  Fights feature armed and unarmed combat and lots of styles; there's a thai boxer who makes concrete blocks cringe in fear. Plus, any gal who can bust out Eagle Claws and shred clothing or skin is awesome in my book!  A more amusing fighter is the Indian whose Yoga style earns him the nickname `Extendar'.  You've got guys who can fight and the enemies come one after the other and they're no pushovers.Jimmy Wang playing the One Armed Boxer is the real deal.  His movements are fluid and what he lacks in appendage, his kung fu skills more than compensate for (look at him climb those walls!).  Despite all obstacles, he never panics and does what he can to survive.  Even though the battle in the Hotfoot Hut seemed unfair, I guess it's no hold barred when killers are after you.  On a fun note, notice the hidden arm or a hand peeking out behind the guy's back in some fight scenes?Flying Guillotine is a cut above the rest.  He won't stop till he gets his revenge.  His finely toned senses make him a deadly opponent especially when his hat goes flying.  It also folds up nice and neat.  There's a bit of dark humor when FG's search for a one armed man leads to several victimsÂ…of which he has NO remorse for killing.Just watch this!</p>
