<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film is seen through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, Harry (Matías del Pozo), who does not know that Argentina's 1976 coup d'état is impacting his life. After witnessing the "disappearance" of dissident friends, a human rights lawyer (Ricardo Darín) and his research scientist wife (Cecilia Roth) flee the city and hide from the military police in a vacant summer house. With them are their two kids: Harry, who is fascinated with the escape artistry of Harry Houdini, and El Enano, his little brother. (Translated as "Little Guy" in the English subtitles, played by Milton de la Canal. The actual translation is "dwarf".) The family adopts new identities and attempts to lead a normal life. Later, they are joined by a student who is using the alias Lucas (Tomás Fonzi). Their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents (Fernanda Mistral and Héctor Alterio) reveals that they are still a close-knit family. Subtly hinted, however, and used as a metaphor, is the mother's constant smoking and El Enano's renewed bed-wetting. Both serve to show how stressful and precarious their situation is.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Kamchatka" depicts a well-functioning family in which love and understanding abound. The contrast between how they behave and what is shown on American television shows in which anger and yelling are the prime behaviors is really very striking. The love within this family really makes "Kamchatka" special. The parents do not try to dominate the children.The family is on the run, hiding out, due to a political shift in which the government lets loose police squads that round up dissenters. This gives the whole film a constant tension. The parents are trying to shield the children from the full impact of the predicament. Plus we feel that at any time, police could show up. Plus being hidden out carries all sorts of restrictions with it, such as making phone calls or visiting friends."Kamchatka" refers to a region on a map that's part of a conquest game that the son plays with the father. It is the last line of defense. It's a metaphor for what the family is being driven to.</p>
