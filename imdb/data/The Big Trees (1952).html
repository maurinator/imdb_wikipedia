<h1>The Big Trees (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1900, unscrupulous timber baron Jim Fallon plans to take advantage of a new law and make millions off California redwood. Much of the land he hopes to grab has been homesteaded by a Quaker colony, who try to persuade him to spare the giant sequoias...but these are the very trees he wants most. Expert at manipulating others, Fallon finds that other sharks are at his own heels, and forms an unlikely alliance.</p>
<p>Jim Fallon is a big-time lumber man who decides to take advantage of a new Act of Congress that encourages the felling of trees like the big Redwoods in California. Fallon is a wheeler dealer who even manages to convince his men to go with him, even though he hasn't been able to pay them for weeks. When he gets to California, he finds that a group of Quakers have laid claim to the land and have done so primarily to protect the trees. He's particularly interested in Sister Alicia Chadwick and soon reconsiders. He'll have to fight some of his own men however if they're to win the battle.</p>
<p>A Quaker colony tries to save the giant sequoias from a timber baron.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I bought a copy of this film for a very small price at a job lot store. The company, Global Multimedia Corporation, said this was a digitally remastered copy, called Value DVD. It was amusing that the cover presented Kirk Douglas and Alicia Chadwick. Alicia Chadwick is actually a major character in the story who was played by Eve Miller.The color of this restored master was indeed very good on my plasma TV. The story was set on a historical event which took place during the McKinley administration in 1900. Apparently, land with the giant redwoods was opened up for grabs by allowing lumber companies to pay for new claims, even for land which had been settled by homesteaders under an 1868 act of Congress. Our hero Jim Fallon heads west with cronies from Wisconsin to make his fortune. As the story unfolds with some tragedy, he is forsaken by former associates, and warms to his new friends, the Quakers who had settled the land before. Indeed, he turns the tide in their favor, thus redeeming himself, and winning the girl.The movie was excellent with great stunts, seemingly performed by Douglas himself. It is really instructive to see how much good film action was done long before digital effects. Indeed, this movie could give you a real taste for quality movies of mid-20th century.</p>
