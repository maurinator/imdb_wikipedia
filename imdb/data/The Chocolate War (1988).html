<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Chocolate War is a movie about a young kid named Jerry and his power struggle with the group at school called the Vigils. They want him to sell the schools annual chocolates but he refuses and from then on the Vigils make his life miserable. I really enjoyed this movie and I thought that Wallace Langham gave a great performance as Archie. He was so mean and cold that you couldn't help hating him and this to me is a sign of a great actor. I think everyone should see this movie and if you already have see it again!</p>
