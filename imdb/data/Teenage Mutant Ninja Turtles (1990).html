<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On your first read of the title, you may think "Ah...the Ninja Turtles...kid's stuff".  That conclusion is partially understandable, considering the fact that most people's minds drift towards the Saturday morning cartoon show, which was made for little kids.  But if you are one of the handful of people who remembers the original TMNT comic book and how dark it was, you will probably think more of the name.  This live-action version of the Teenaged Turtles reaches back into its comic book origins and sacrifices the kiddie stuff in favor of a darker, more brooding film.  This is the key to this movie's greatness.  It shows the Turtles how they were meant to be shown.  The movie is still fun, though, supplying the viewer with all the early 90's teenager slang and ass-kicking that you can squeeze onto celuloid.  The only problem is that the whole Ninja Turtles franchise has come with a love it or hate it tag attached to it, often times giving it a bad rap that it really doesn't deserve.  The film is no Blade Runner or Spiderman by any means, but it's still a great little piece of cinema that you can just sit down with a bowl of popcorn (or maybe a pizza) and enjoy without much thought.  Sadly, this is as good as the series gets (not that this movie could get much better).  The sequels (TMNT 2: Secret of the Ooze and TMNT 3) aren't really that great.  TMNT 2 lacks the gritty edge that makes this movie good (having Vanilla Ice on the soundtrack doesn't help much either) and TMNT 3 is obviously aimed directly for the little ones.  This is the great little movie.  COWABUNGA!!!</p>
