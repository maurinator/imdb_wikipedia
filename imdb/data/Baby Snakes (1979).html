<h1>Baby Snakes (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rock artist Frank Zappa hosts a concert in New York City. This movie contains tons of on-stage footage, off-stage footage, and animation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A must-see for every Zappa fan. This film must be seen in its original 3-hour version if possible. The live concert footage shows perfectly what an incredible musician/composer/bandleader Zappa was. The rest of the band (featuring Adrian Belew, Tommy Mars and Terry Bozzio) put in great performances as well. I wish the re-release of the "Baby Snakes" CD from four years ago was expanded to include more concert footage from this movie.</p>
