<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the best movies I've ever seen - a real life experience between two people wanting each other and want to be alone without sex and nudity really being needed to tell a real life adventure. The way Gabriel and Mark noticed one another at a strip club and in a subway car was beautifully done. Gabriel wanting to look at Mark sleeping in the subway car was spotted by a woman watching him watching Mark - Gabriel's eyes slowly looking back at Mark was so beautiful and sad and funny one of the best scenes in the movie. To Christian Campbell who plays Gabriel, John Paul Pitoc who plays Mark and the production crew for "Trick", THANK YOU.</p>
