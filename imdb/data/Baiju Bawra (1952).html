<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young singer, in the time of Emperor Akbar the Great, sets out to avenge his father, killed in a disturbance near the house of a member of the Court.</p>
<p>Hoping to learn music from Swami Haridas, Baijnath accompanies his Hari Bhajan-singing father all the way from Gujarat to Brindavan. En route his father is assaulted and killed by a guard of Tansen, the Sangeet Samrat of Mughal Badshah Akbar. Baijnath promises his dying father that he will avenge his death. Baijnath is adopted by Shankaranand, who lives near Jamuna river. He grows up there and has a sweetheart in Gauri. Years later Baijnath will be reminded of his vow after he gets abducted by Daku Roopmati. He decides to forget Gauri, and becomes obsessed with killing Tansen at any and all costs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen this movie many many times and will do so in future. Naushad, in my books, was the greatest composer of Hindi film Sangeet (runners up being C. Ramchandra and Shankar Jaikishan).To bring out the innermost emotions of a Raaga into a 3 or 4 minute song is the accomplishment of a genius. If you want a child to learn Raagdari, just let him listen and learn to play these songs. Then you don't have to force him to learn music. By the way, one of the greatest Bhajans "Man Tarapat Hari Darashan Ko Aaj" shows that the only religion of the artists (song writer Shakeel Badayuni, composer Naushad, singer Mohamad Rafi) is their art.</p>
