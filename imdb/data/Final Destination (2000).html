<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Without being an absolute masterpiece, "Final Destination" is a good fantastic movie that deserves to be watched. It borrows several elements from other movies or novels such as "Scream" or "And then there were none" but it exploits them very well. And this is helped thanks to a clever script that includes a few qualities, notably this one: we can't really see death but we can feel its presence and its cleverness. Moreover, the suspense is well lead during all the movie until the end.But if "Final Destination" isn't a masterpiece, it's because it also contains faults: for example, how can Alex, the hero of the film succeed in seeing these odd visions about "accidents that are going to happen"? Then, he doesn't get on well with one of the main characters (you can consider him as his worst enemy) and however they'll be compelled to help each other in order to escape from death. You could also say that certain sequences are predictable while some are on the verge of unlikely.Nonetheless, a rather good fantastic movie.</p>
