<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this because it has the first on-screen performances by Erika Alexander and Jennifer Lopez, both born in 1969. To me the feel of the movie was much more like the 1950s, or at the most the mid-1960s. I was surprised to see the release date as 1986.Even James Earl Jones and Ann Meara (Jerry Stiller's wife) look younger to me than they did in the 1980s.I taught in a large east coast city from 1962 on and that's exactly what a number of these girls' homes were like. Today would be much rougher. Good cast. All the young actors did a great job.These days the homes would be begging for volunteers like Mary Stuart Masterson!</p>
