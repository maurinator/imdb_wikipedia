<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>JOHNNY SUEDE is a very early role for Brad Pitt (he had just finished THELMA AND LOUSIE). yet he delivers a surprisingly nuanced performance as a clueless and childlike hipster. Many films of this nature boast a character who is in love with his own hipness, and delights in educating his contemporaries to this fact. Nothing can be farther from this than Pitt's take on Johnny. His reading of the character is so hesitant and tentative, as to be almost "challenged". Catherine Keener's character (who is introduced much too late in the film) becomes the driving force in the film, and attempts to show this carefully coiffed dandy what it might mean to be a man. A proper release of the film was held up because backers weren't sure his performance would connect with fans who were expecting a more polished Hollywood Heart Throb. Quirky and Mind-bending indeed. Excellent Commentary by Tom DiCillo.</p>
