<h1>Booty Call (2013)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's night time, and under the cover of darkness the pirate Babinksy rows a small boat up to a huge ship anchored in a bay. On board is a treasure of immeasurable worth. Babinsky cuts a hole in the side of the ship to steal the treasure chest inside, chuckling to himself the whole time. Once inside, Babinsky sees the treasure is more than he could have imagined! But when he lifts the overflowing treasure chest into his rowboat, a single coin falls out and rolls deep into the ship. Even though it's only a single coin from the massive treasure, Babinsky's greed gets the better of him and he chases the rolling coin through the ship until it falls into a grate covering a dark hole. Without thinking, he pulls open the grate, but red eyes FLASH in the darkness. Uh oh. Before Babinsky can cover the grate back up, a barrel rolls into him, and knocks him into the pit below. ROARING and SCRATCHING accompany Babinsky's screams, and just before the silence, we hear a big BURP, and the coin is spit out of the grate.</p>
<p>A greedy pirate boards a ship to steal the treasure, but gets way more than he bargained for...</p>
