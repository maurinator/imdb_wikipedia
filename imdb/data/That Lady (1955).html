<h1>That Lady (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ana, the Princess of Eboli, wears a black patch over her right eye, where she was blinded as a youth when fighting a duel in defense of her king, the despotic Philip. Thereafter she and the monarch were close friends, although his passion for her was never consummated. She marries one of Philip's ministers, bore him a son, and soon became a widow. Now Philip calls upon her to assist in coaching a commoner, Antonio Perez, for the office of first secretary to the crown.The result is more than Philip bargained for as Ana and Antonio become lovers and create a scandal in court, always the scene of perpetual intrigue. Philip has Antonio arrested on a drummed-up charge of murder, and when Ana refuses to leave Madrid, she too is arrested. After spending time in jail, she is transferred to her home and held in check. Antonio escapes and makes his way to Ana, who persuades him to leave the country and take her son.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a very big fan of Mrs De Havilland ,I was very anxious to watch it! What a big disappointment!This costume melodrama is certainly one of her worst parts if not simply the worst!she's so subtle an actress one wonders why she did not turn it down and let it to lesser talents ;there are plenty of starlets who could have been content with it!perhaps because an one-eyed character is not very attractive!As for the story itself ,it's a Spanish princess in love with the king's minister -and loved by the king too-;the minister is involved in a murder but that lady cannot even serve as an alibi .The king has his own problems with his brother who covets his throne .The script is inept,the cinematography is poor ,and the actors ,left to their own devices ,do what they can but it's not enough to save the movie;French viewers will notice the presence of Fran√ßoise Rosay as Bernadine aka Bernie ,one of our greatest actresses;like De Havilland and Scofield,why did she get involved in that business with that lady?</p>
