<h1>Nighthawks (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Deke DaSilva and Matthew Fox are two New York City cops who get transferred to an elite anti-terrorism squad. About this same time, an infamous international terrorist shows up in New York City looking to cause some chaos. It's up to DaSilva and Fox to stop him, but will they be in time...?</p>
<p>New York City cop Deke DaSilva loves his job on the decoy squad so much he has several times forgone promotion. So when he and his partner are assigned to a new anti-terrorist unit he is pretty hostile to the idea. The unit is run by a British expert who suspects a major terrorist is in town. His message is shoot to kill, which makes DaSilva even unhappier. But when bombs start going off he thinks again.</p>
<p>Wulfgar a terrorist, who has been plaguing Europe, is now in the U.S. A British counter terrorism expert arrives in New York City to help and he chooses Detectives from the NYPD to train on how to deal with Wulfgar. Among the ones he chooses is Deke De Silva, a veteran cop, who doesn't he think he is suited for the job. But tries to do the best he can. Eventually he comes face to face with Wulfgar and hesitates shooting him despite being told that he should shoot him if he has the chance, which not only allows him to escape but to injure his partner. Wulfgar now has his sights set on him as well as his other targets. DeSilva can now only wait for Wulfgar to make his next move.</p>
<p>Conservative street cop DaSilva reluctantly agrees to terminate an international terrorist who has demanded media attention. But DaSilva's "at-home" tactics are very much put to the challenge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer) is an international terrorist not to be taken lightly He is wanted by half the countries in Europe He is currently financed by no one... He becomes trapped as 'Persona Non Grata'Wulfgar manages to succeed where others have failed His pattern is the instilling of fear He makes female contacts to establish safe housing for his armory He always covers a woman who is clean... He loses one, he finds another... He has a liking for fancy food, expensive clothes and the most varied nightlifeWulfgar doesn't think like a criminal He wants to be a hero Since the London incidents, he wants to prove himself as invincible as he ever was So he decides to change his look, and strikes without warning... Wulfgar's associate is Shakka Holland (Persis Khambatta), a pretty cool woman, with no maternal instincts, who murders without apparent provocationDaSilva (Sylvester Stallone) wants to treat Wulfgar like 'some mugger' on the streets He makes a mistake when he finds himself unexpectedly facing the malevolent killer... He refuses to act in the same ruthlessness Wulfgar does, and to use deadly force in defense of the lives of innocent hostages He hesitates to shoot and kill DaSilva rejected to pay attention to the impact of the terrorist's actions on his thinking and beliefs This mistake enables the best policeman to meet the dangerous terrorist on equal terms'Nighthawks' turns out to be surprisingly interesting Rutger Hauer easily holds our attention throughout the film He is a disciplined terrorist indifferent to his victims, cold and calculating His mission to harm the enemy transcends any concern about his victims For Wulfgar, the end justifies the means... Stallone and Billy Dee Williams make good partners Stallone doesn't play his usual character, the ruthless policeman who combats violence with greater violence He seems to be more human desperately trying to do the right thing at the right time</p>
