<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has a lot of great stuff to recommend it. It's very funny, and the little world it creates is fascinating and a lot of fun. All the main characters and the supporting part are interesting, and the actors (and actress) involved turn in great performances. Up until the end I was ready to call it a masterpiece. Sadly, the director just couldn't pull it all together in the end, and the tightly woven plot just seems to fall apart. Definitely a more mature piece than Attack the Gas Station, with potential to surpass it, but ATGS hangs together better and never loses its high. Worth seeing though, and I look forward to anything this director wants to try.  The guy is a real talent. Special tip of the hat to Sung-jae Lee, that guy is awesome.</p>
