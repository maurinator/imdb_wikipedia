<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A very elusive film on this side of the Atlantic.  It received only a brief and limited theatrical release in the United States.  It is reportedly available on video, but in the PAL (European) format, not NTSC (USA and Canada).  It hasn't been aired in the Washington, D.C., area in over 20 years.My recollection is that it had beautiful photography and production design, but a hectic and confusing storyline.  Typical of many European imports of the time, it had a jerky continuity (editing by the importer?) and some awkward dubbing with the usual "Speed Racer" voices.  An attempt to compete with Hollywood epics that came up a bit short.What I found both distracting and amusing was that the actor who played Barabbas was a dead ringer for a crazy professional wrestler named Bugsy McGraw.  In fact, they actually talked and acted much the same!</p>
