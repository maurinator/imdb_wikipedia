<h1>Rhinoceros (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Originally an absurdist play by Eugene Ionesco, Rhinoceros tells the story of a French town plagued by rhinoceroses. These are not ordinary rhinoceroses, but people who have been victims of "rhinoceritis." Or is it something else entirely? But, why are they turning into rhinoceroses and what is Ionesco trying to tell us about society?</p>
<p>A hungover Stanley meets his pompous and condescending best friend, John, at a restaurant. John's inevitable criticisms about Stanley's drinking and dishevelment are interrupted by a rhinoceros charging through the street outside. This provides the staff and the patrons some amusement until the creature charges through the restaurant and destroys everything. At the office, Stanley arrives late as the boss and the other workers are having an argument about the absurd news reports regarding these animals. The attractive but not overly bright Daisy insists she saw the rhinoceros with her own eyes. Stanley says the same thing, but it's not until a coworker on the street below changes into a rhinoceros before their eyes that they grasp the importance, and absurdity, of what is happening. Soon, everyone is becoming a rhinoceros, and Stanley is feeling the pressure to conform.</p>
<p>A boozing young man in love with his co-worker finds that everyone around him, even his pompous and condescending best friend, is changing into a rhinoceros.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As with others that commented on this film, I first saw Rhinoceros because it starred Gene Wilder.  At the time, in the mid 1970's, Wilder was near the peak of his popularity.  The film was a complete surprise to me.  Very bizarre, nothing that I expected.  Years later, I remember that I was quite disappointed with the movie and wondered just what it was that Wilder was doing.  Years later, however, I find that the memory of this film has never left me.  The premise of the movie, that of all the towns-people turning into Rhino's, escaped me.  Today, I relate this film, in some ways to the novel 1984.  I see the resemblance of the Rhino to sheep and/or cattle.  This Wilder film is not comical.  It is, however, a strangely unsettling satire that is difficult to forget.  I, for one, am looking to purchase a copy of this film on DVD.  I'm sure that it's meaning will be more apparent to me today than it was when first viewed 40 years ago.</p>
