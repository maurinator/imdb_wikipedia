<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Georgia Mozell, Eve Marks and Maddy Mozell are adult sisters. Georgia is the editor of her own wildly successful self-titled women's magazine. She strives for publicity at any cost. Party planner Eve is the mother hen of the group, not only of her own family, but also of her siblings and father as their mother, Pat, not only emotionally left their father when they divorced, but her daughters as well. And Maddy is a vacuous soap opera actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine year old father, Lou Mozell, when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization. Eve's caring for Lou is despite an especially hurtful incident with him seven years earlier. As the emotional aspect of looking after Lou becomes more and more stressful, Eve has to figure out how to maintain her own sanity, while dealing with her sisters, who believe they too are part of their father's care while they don't lift a finger to help.</p>
<p>A trio of sisters bond over their ambivalence toward the approaching death of their curmudgeonly father, to whom none of them was particularly close.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is so awful I don't even know where to start ripping it apart. I am starting to think that the Ephron sisters simply had a fluke in "When Harry Met Sally".  With the possible exception of "Sleepless in Seattle", their other films have been unmitigated disasters.  This film is no exception.  It is simply terrible.  In fact it is worse than terrible, it is exceptionally frustrating.  The story, without giving away any of the non-existent plot, centers around three sisters coping with their relationship with their father.  They contact each other incessantly by cell phone, hence the title.  Halfway through the film, you just want to grab their cell phones and smash them on the floor.  They interrupt whatever they are doing to answer their phones, and there must be 100 calls answered during the 90 minute movie.Meg Ryan is apparently trying to prove that she is a one-dimensional actress.  She is, once again (ho-hum), playing the cutesy, bumbling, blond that earned her fame in When Harry Met Sally.  This is a role that she plays over and over and over again, and it is downright boring now.  Diane Keaton is supposed to be her sister, there are scenes with the 3 of them playing as youngsters.  Diane Keaton is about 25 years older than Meg Ryan, without even mentioning Lisa Kudrow.  Kudrow has of course, simply re-played her character from Friends.Please avoid this movie at all costs.  It is worse than John Travolta's incredibly bad "Battlefield Earth".  It is even worse than the up-to-this-film, worst-movie-of-all-time "Next Friday".  At least you could laugh at John Travolta and know that he had proven himself in other works. But "Hanging Up" will leave you seething with frustration and unfulfilled promise.  I gave it a 1 out of 10.  Truly awful.</p>
