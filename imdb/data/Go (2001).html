<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i saw this film at the berlin film festival where it was part of the 'panorama' showings (not in the actual competition itself). it was perhaps unhelpfully billed as a film about the 'taboo of relationships between japanese and koreans'. i wouldn't say that it was particularly about that at all - more like a teenager's struggle for identity.i found it to be an excellent film. funny, touching and well-played. it deserves some international success.</p>
