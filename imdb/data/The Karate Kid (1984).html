<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Daniel and his mother move from New Jersey to California. She has a wonderful new job, but Daniel quickly discovers that a dark haired Italian boy with a Jersey accent doesn't fit into the blond surfer crowd. Daniel manages to talk his way out of some fights, but he is finally cornered by several who belong to the same karate school. As Daniel is passing out from the beating he sees Miyagi, the elderly gardener leaps into the fray and save him by outfighting half a dozen teenagers. Miyagi and Daniel soon find out the real motivator behind the boys' violent attitude in the form of their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach Daniel karate and arranges a fight at the all-valley tournament some months off. When his training begins, Daniel doesn't understand what he is being shown. Miyagi seems more interested in having Daniel paint fences and wax cars than teaching him Karate.</p>
<p>Daniel LaRusso has just moved from New Jersey to Reseda, CA (a neighborhood in Los Angeles) and is finding it hard to acclimatise to life in the new city.

He meets a beautiful blond girl, but encounters a gang of bullies who make his life a living hell. This further dampens Daniel's spirit as he just wants to go home. He is continually bullied and is afraid to show his face around the high school. He then meets mentor/handyman Mr. Miyagi who takes the naive Daniel under his wing and shows him that Karate and life aren't all about power and strength. It's something deep within you're soul that makes you what you are. Daniel is the underdog and faces the biggest challenge of his life. WIN and he can rejoice forever knowing he beat the bullies. LOSE? They'll never let him forget it!!</p>

Determined to stick up for himself, Daniel begins to teach himself karate, only to discover that the caretaker at his apartment seems to be a grand master in karate.

<p>Meet Daniel Larusso, a mild-mannered New Jersey teenager who has to move from his native state to Los Angeles, California when his mother was offered a job there. He thought that he was going to have a nice house with a pool, then he finds out that his new home is a crummy apartment.

Then, a Japanese handyman named Keusuke Miyagi comes to aid Daniel. He asked Miyagi to teach him karate, which he does (in a roundabout way). Daniel and Miyagi then developed a great relationship and he wanted to teach the karate fighting punks a lesson, so he signs up for a karate tournament. Daniel is determined to win.</p>
<p>A martial arts master agrees to teach karate to a bullied teenager.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While John Hughs' films may be the standard  for teen flicks in the 1980s, Hughs' films were  just a few of the great and unique teen films  to be released in that decade. Coupled with  Back to the Future, Fast Times at Ridgemont  High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Bill and  Ted's Excellent Adventure, the 80s was a  rather unique time for teen movies. The  Karate Kid just happened to be another one  of those films. With the immortal Pat Morita  leading the way, this film was not only touching,  but put a whole new spin on the `zero-to-hero'  story line which we have all seen too often.  Ralph Macchio may have had no career  after these film, but at least he proved to be  comparable as Daniel (san). Sure, the  ending and outcome proved to be a little  predictable, but the film was still a winner.</p>
