<h1>The Miracle (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The two teenagers Jimmy and Rose spend their vacation at the small Irish sea-resort Bray. Out of boredom they observe other people and imagine wild stories about them. One day they observe the blonde Renee, and Jimmy is immediately fascinated by her and even follows her home. She, too, seems to like him, but for a mysterious reason keeps him at a distance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this under-rated film Neil Jordan has created a very real portrait of how some teen-agers actually think and feel. The treatment of such a touchy subject as incest handled with a deft enough touch to almost make it believable.Some editing to cut redundant scenes would have made this a truly great movie. While watching Niall Byrne it was hard not to think of look alike Australian tennis player, Leyton Hewitt.</p>
