A survivor of the war, who lost most of his family to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, he lives with his uncle in Phnom Penh. Savannah begins a romance with a 19-year-old bar girl, Srey Poeuv (Chea Lyda Chan). She is humiliated by her debts to the bar's owner, and is forced to keep working. Savannah wants to help Srey clear her debt, so he teams up with an ex-soldier and plans a crime that could net him some money.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A Cambodian soldier returns from war right into buzzling, dirty Phnom Penh . He has no money, shelter and girl, like most of the soldiers. He finds love, but in times of facing poverty, love becomes a thing you cannot aford. Camera-work and dialogues are great as in Neak Sre, the plot sometimes weakens. For what I like this movie, are the contrasts of love and hate, loneliness and family, hope and resignation. Ugly but also lovely. You have to see it, to feel it !</p>
