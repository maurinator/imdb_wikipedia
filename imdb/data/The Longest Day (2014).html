<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dani deals with the consequences for what happened with Brandon. Jude and Callie spend the day on the Quinn's yacht.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The biggest topic of the episode deals with the rape of boys, in this case statutory, and the double standard which comes with such a concept. Alongside that, we are shown Hayley who is slowly becoming a Fatal Attraction-esque type of girlfriend as she slowly starts raising her red flag which Jesus apparently can't see. Leaving one last topic: Callie. With her dad getting attached, as well as Sophia, my early on prediction of him fighting for her seems to be vocalized. Especially since Sophia's life is so sheltered that it seems it may be causing her some form of depression she may think only Callie can bring her out of. More on that below.Topic 1: School Team Drama  Mariana and JesusAs Mariana learns the dance team is underfunded, and won't have two of its members join them in competition, her fears of being cut rise once more. And, being that Mariana loves putting her foot in her mouth, she passive-aggressively blames Tia. Not because Tia did anything, per se, but because she is making everyone else look bad. For with them doing contemporary and hip-hop, Mariana just feels out of place and even says Tia needs to perhaps blend in more. Leading her to come off a bit prejudice which makes Tia uncomfortable. Though with the dance team talking about parents, and Tia learning Mariana is adopted, and Lena is her mom, she realizes Mariana probably doesn't realize the effect her words can have and she forgives her. But does bust her chops a little when Mariana asks why does she need to practice? In which she replies with a "Is it because I'm Black" type of joke. Which makes Mariana uncomfortable, but with Tia just joking their tension seems over as Tia helps Mariana learn the dance steps.Leading us to talk about fellow dance member Hayley. Her and Jesus' relationship was made public by Mariana and it has caused some tension between Jesus and Emma, but the real issues seem to be in Jesus and Hayley's relationship. After all, with Emma on the wrestling team it means a lot of alone time, then with them being in the same weight class it means them practicing together. Which means he will be touching her, feeling her, and while Hayley doesn't act jealous outright, you can tell she is worried. In fact, when the coach is supposed to have a little award ceremony/ dinner at his house, Hayley uses the fact Jesus doesn't know about her parents' divorce to keep him from going. Something which is very manipulative, and slightly worrisome because it is unclear if this is just a taste of what is to come, or as far as she may be willing to go.Topic 2: Two Families, One Home  Callie & JudeWith Jude talking again, Callie seems to think it is best for him to meet the competition. And, for the most part, he enjoys being around the Quinn family. Even Jill, Sophia's mom, who seems really nosey and is probably trying to dig up dirt, which I don't blame her for doing. Especially because, in an effort to seem cool, Sophia acts a little bratty toward her and having Callie around makes Robert talk about Callie's mom probably to a point where it may make her insecure. So her trying to think of a way to make sure Callie doesn't invade her home I find justifiable. But, between Robert wanting to invest in Callie's future plans when it comes to college and Sophia really growing attached to the idea of having a sister, it seems Stef and Lena may have a fight on their hands. Well, that is unless Callie decides to just join the Quinns, which I doubt will happen.Topic 3: He Knew What He Was Doing, Right?  Mike, Brandon, Stef & LenaWith it being Saturday in the episode, and everyone out of the house, Lena thinks it is the perfect time to address the Dani situation. Which, as you can imagine, leads to a huge blow up. Stef blames Mike for allowing Dani near their son; Mike is upset with Dani, but not so upset he doesn't want explanations; and meanwhile Brandon retreats as Lena tries to play mediator.But perhaps the most interesting part of this whole storyline is Mike's take which has him remove the victimization of Brandon. Not to the point he blames Brandon, for after all he was drinking, but he doesn't see how he was raped. Allowing for a larger conversation about how when the rape victim is a man, or boy in this case, their victim hood is taken away. Especially if it is a woman because then the idea is they liked it, if not wanted it. Something which, honestly, makes the situation complicated for it isn't like Brandon was given a GHB like substance and Viagra, he did participate. At the same time though, it must be noted he is 16 and the age of consent in California is 18. So she did commit statutory rape. Of which Mike fights Stef on, at first, but as they separate and reflect, you can see with time they come to an agreement that Dani committed a crime.It should be noted though, their time isn't solely committed to the Dani situation. Also, Stef is forced to confront how hard she is on people, and herself, and why Brandon went to Lena before her. Then we watch as both Mike and Stef talk about their failed marriage and while it is nice to see them talk about their relationship, honestly they have gone over their relationship enough for my taste.</p>
