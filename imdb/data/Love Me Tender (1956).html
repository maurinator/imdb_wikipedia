<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite switching the film's title from The Reno Brothers to Love Me Tender in order to capitalize on the young singer's popularity, Elvis still took second billing in his big screen debut, a typical Western that takes place just after the completion of the Civil War.  The setting makes for some unintentionally humorous anachronisms, as the spirit of E's musical numbers is far more at home in the 1950s than the 1860s.  Love Me Tender's plot sets up a love triangle involving two brothers: Elvis' character Clint Reno (love that name) marries his big brother's sweetheart when the elder sibling fails to return from the war, but brother Vance unexpectedly shows up and naturally is not happy about the state of affairs on the family farm.  The rivalry brings about tragic consequences, however, which incited fans enough to bring about a compromise ending cooked up by Twentieth Century-Fox to placate obsessive Elvis devotees.</p>
