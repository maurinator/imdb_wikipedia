<h1>Pinjar (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hindustan (Urdu name for India) used to a vast territory and countries' like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangla Desh, and Bhutan were all it's provinces. All this changed when the British established their rule over India, and promoted their policy of hatred, and division - mainly between the Hindus and the Muslims. After their departure in 1947, the celebrations of a independent India were short-lived, and the divisions created by the British stayed on and flourished with extremists from both sides ready to kill anyone from the other side. While the Muslims under Jinnah wanted a separate country, which they would like to call Pakistan, the Hindus wanted the Muslims to leave this country and go to Pakistan. Clashes followed, millions fled, millions more were killed, Very little is known of mankind's heinous behavior in this circumstances, such as looting, raping, and kidnapping. Lajjo was one such woman who was recently married to Ramchand, and then abducted by a man named Rashid, who gets her to Pakistan, where she is to be second wife of an abusive and controlling male. Her sister-in-law, Puro, distraught at losing her Bhabhi in such short a time, sets out to search for her, encouraged by her brother, but cautioned by her parents, who would not prefer to lose another child. Puro begins her task of locating Lajjo and calls herself Hamida, ironically assisted by none other than a much changed and remorseful Rashid, and goes from door to door as a petty saleswoman and cleaner. Then one day she finds Lajjo. Not quite the fun-loving and exuberant Lajjo she knew, but a much subdued one - trapped and under the 24/7 control of "Amma" and her alcoholic husband. Puro does get to speak to her in private, and both conspire to escape, hopefully back to her husband and their family. The question remains will Puro be successful in getting Lajjo to escape, or will she herself be entrapped in a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to Partition, a Hindu woman is abducted by a Muslim man. Soon, she finds herself not only forced into marriage, but living in a new country as the borders between India and Pakistan are drawn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US. So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. Luckily, no comparison is needed.Pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece.In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time. On a mass-appeal scale, it *could* have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" had it been adequately promoted in the US. This could very well have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American movie-going public has a long-standing love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar doesn't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities. Not the least of which is the whopping (by US standards) 183-minute run time.Set against the gritty backdrop of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating. Put into an untenable position, she somehow manages to not only survive, but to grow -- and even flourish.If the story is lacking in any way, it's in the exposition. Puro's (the protagonist) growth as a person would be better illustrated -- at least for western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture -- if her character's "back story" were more fully developed in the early part of the film. But that would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or perhaps even more. Because not one minute of the film is wasted, and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time. Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains.I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "compelling", "heart-wrenching" come to mind immediately. But "uplifting" is perhaps as apropos as any of those. Any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such. And Puro's triumph -- while possibly not immediately evident to those around her -- is no less than inspirational. For strength of story alone I cannot recommend this film highly enough.Equally inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's portrayal of Puro. All too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger, newer actresses, Urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays. She doesn't merely act Puro's part, she breathes life into the character. Manoj Bajpai's selection as Rashid was inspired. He manages something far too few Indian film heroes can: subtlety. His command of expression and nuance is essential to the role. He brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword-wielding rioters combined.If you only see one Bollywood film in your life, make it Pinjar.</p>
