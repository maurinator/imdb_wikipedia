<h1>The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rachel arrives in New York from her Amish community intent on becoming a dancer. Unfortunately Billy Minsky's Burlesque is hardly the place for her Dances From The Bible. But the show's comedian Raymond sees a way of wrong-footing the local do-gooders by announcing the new Paris sensation "Mme Fifi" and putting on Rachel's performance as the place is raided. All too complicated, the more so since her father is scouring the town for her and both Raymond and his straight-man Chick are falling for Rachel.</p>
<p>1925. Not truly comprehending what she is doing, Rachel Schpitendavel leaves her Amish Pennsylvania home to head to the National Winter Garden Theater in New York City to become a dancer. The dances she wants to perform are reenactments of Bible stories. The National Wintergarden Theater she stumbles upon in the Lower East Side is owned by Louis Minsky, and houses his son Billy Minsky's revue, Minsky's Burlesque. She meets the show's headlining act, Raymond Paine and Chick Williams, both men who fall for her. While Chick wants to protect her both by showing her what burlesque really is and by getting her away from the show, Raymond believes she is the answer to one of Billy's biggest problems, namely Vance Fowler, who feels the show is amoral and wants it shut down. Without telling Rachel what it actually means, Raymond wants to advertise Rachel as Mlle. Fifi for the midnight show, her performance advertised as the stuff that has driven all of Paris wild by its lewdness. As Raymond anticipates that Fowler will call in the police to shut the show down, Fowler will be too embarrassed to ever step foot in the theater again when Rachel, as Mlle. Fifi, instead dances her straight-laced Bible dances. Raymond doesn't care that in the process Rachel may also get hurt. As midnight approaches, whether Rachel makes it to the stage will depend on the machinations of Raymond, Chick, Billy and Louis among others, but also includes Rachel's father, Jacob Schpitendavel, who has come to New York to find his daughter and take her home before she does anything against his Amish beliefs. If she does make it to the stage, Rachel herself may have some say in what she decides to do.</p>
<p>A naive Amish young woman runs away from her home in Pennsylvania to New York City where she hopes to act in religious stage plays but ends up performing in Burlesque theatre.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And I mean that most sincerely, this is one of the great films of the 1960s, charting the last days of the burlesque music-hall theatricals in America. The plot of the film is something of a mish-mash, mixing up Britt Ekland as an Amish runaway who finds herself onstage, with Denholm Elliot as a moralistic do-gooder trying to close down Minsky's theatre, but in truth, as with a large number of films of the period (see also The Pink Panther films), the plot is merely a convenience, a washing line upon which to hang a large number of characters, theatrical set-pieces and little illustrations of life in and around the theatrical world. A host of fine actors grace the screen, with Elliot Gould making an early appearance as Minsky jr, Harry Andrews as Ekland's glowering father, Joseph Wiseman as Minsky sr and most affectingly, Bert Lahr in his final screen performance. Even Ekland is OK, and it takes a lot to say that. But at the centre of it all are Jason Robards and Norman Wisdom as the theatre's chief comedy double-act. An odd pairing that works amazingly well, with Robards an effectively sleezy straight man (his seduction of Ekland is both funny and stomach churning). But if Robards is good, Wisdsom is fantastic, his comedic skills honed in England finally being given full rein (I enjoy a lot of his British films, but few of them really allow him full use of his abilities), and the song and dance routine and when he defines burlesque to Ekland rank as his finest on-screen moments. it's a bitter shame that the failure of this film and personal circumstances forced him to leave Hollywood, because with the right material he could have gone so much further. Truth is, if you have no sympathy for this sort of material, this will not change your mind. But for an utterly unique film, packed with beautiful little minutiae of theatrical life and a great mix of dark humour and bawdy comedy, this is really something to be cherished.</p>
