<h1>Assassins (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Robert Rath is a seasoned hitman who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain.</p>
<p>Robert Rath, who lives in Portland, Oregon, is a professional hit man. He does his business via the electronic superhighway, making contact by fax modem and collecting his money by wire transfer. Fifteen years ago, Robert fulfilled a contract to kill Russian crime boss Nicolai Tashlinkov. Now, Robert has been given a contract to kill crime boss Alan Branch, but someone else shows up and kills Branch, stealing the contract from Robert. Robert soon discovers that it was vicious rival hit man Miguel Bain who stole the contract. Bain is as ruthless as Robert is principled. Robert won't fire randomly into a crowd, for fear of killing innocent bystanders. Bain treats civilians like they're the next best thing to body armor. Robert is by now getting tired of killing people, so he wants to retire. But he decides to take one more job, the target being a Seattle woman named Electra, who is a surveillance expert and information thief who will be selling a floppy disk of stolen data to a group of Dutch buyers led by a man named Remy. Before Robert can do anything, Bain shows up and kills the four Dutch buyers. Robert, who has the disk, declares himself retired and becomes Electra's protector because Bain is determined to kill Robert and Electra and get the disk.</p>
<p>Professional hit-man Robert Rath wants to fulfill a few more contracts before retiring but unscrupulous ambitious newcomer hit-man Miguel Bain keeps killing Rath's targets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In order to really enjoy this movie, you have to put your brain in a freezer for 133 minutes and just refrain from trying analyze anything in here. There are more holes in this story than swiss cheese, as the clich√© somewhat goes.Having said that, however, I did enjoy the action scenes and the by-play between the two assassins - "Robert Rath" (Sylvester Stallone) and "Miguel Bain" (Antonio Banderas) - enough to make it a fun ride. I might even have rated it another star higher had a few things weren't confusing and left unanswered, or Banderas spoke clearer English. Still, it's not bad and for fans of "Sly" and action films, worth a look.</p>
