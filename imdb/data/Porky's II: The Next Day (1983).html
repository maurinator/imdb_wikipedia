<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>what the hell did i just see?  i had never taken the time to watch porky's 2 until tonight (on comedy central).i found nothing funny about it, and i am a big comedy fan and can usually find some good in everything.  i can't believe this came from the same director that did A CHRISTMAS STORY, one of my all time favorites.</p>
