<h1>The Boatniks (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young and awkward, The Coast-Guard's ensign Thomas Garland suffers from the comparison with his late father, a war hero. Which does not prevent him from falling for pretty Kate Fairchild, a young woman who runs a sailing school. Of course the way he expresses his deep sympathy for the lady leaves to be desired. And the situation does not improve when a trio of bumbling jewel thieves interferes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is not as far off-base as some may believe. Having served in the Coast Guard in the 80's (a little after this movie came out in 1970) it is not too hard to believe that many of the scenes could have really taken place (and still do in a lot of places).Sure, you'd surely be relieved of command for sinking a boat, but chill it's a comedy, not a documentary.Anyway, Phil Silvers is marvelous and Norman Fell is so good in his deadpan role. Stephanie Powers is about as hot as she ever was and Don Ameche as the Base CO is perfect. And don't forget Wally Cox as Jason - I wish he had tied up near us! Don't expect too much from this lightweight, but rather sit back, maybe crack open a cold one (don't set it by your compass - of course cans were made of steel then) and just enjoy a far simpler time.</p>
