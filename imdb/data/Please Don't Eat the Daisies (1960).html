<h1>Please Don't Eat the Daisies (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Drama critic Larry McKay, his wife Kay, and their four sons move from their crowded Manhattan apartment to an old house in the country. While housewife Kay settles into suburban life, Larry continues to enjoy the theater and party scene of New York. Kay soon begins to question Larry's fidelity when he mentions a flirtatious encounter with Broadway star Deborah Vaughn.</p>
<p>University drama professor Laurence Mackay and his wife Kate Mackay prefer the quiet of home life - however quiet theirs can be living in a New York City apartment with four rambunctious adolescent and/or infant sons and a sheepdog - than the high life often associated with the New York theater. That is why they plan to move to the country whenever they can find a suitable house. Their lives have the potential to change when Larry becomes a theater critic for one of the big New York City newspapers, meaning that he, along with his six colleagues at the other big New York papers, control what stays and what goes on Broadway by their critiques. Things do not start off well for Larry in this new job when the first play he is to review is that of his and Kate's best friend, Alfred North, who is the godfather to their children. Larry, who had always been seen as a fair man, hates the play, and gives it a bad review. Kate begins to believe that Larry is changing because of his new job, seeming now to enjoy the socialite parties he used to abhor, and almost wanting to be able to write a bad review as they contain more quotable witticisms than good reviews and wield more power in terms of fear from producers. He also seems no longer to want to move to the country. They are, out of circumstances, forced to move regardless. In their run down country home in Hooton, New York, Kate tries to carve out a new life for their family. But her participation in a local charity theater production for which she asks Alfred for a new play to mount threatens not only the Mackay's friendship with Alfred, but the Mackay's marriage altogether.</p>
<p>Drama professor Lawrence McKay gets caught up in the Manhattan social circle when he takes a job as a theater critic for a New York daily. His wife Kay, however, wants the couple and their four rowdy sons to move to the country. She soon finds herself dealing with fixing up their dilapidated country home and competing for her husband's affections with flirtatious Broadway diva Deborah Vaughn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on the best-selling novel by Jean Kerr, "Please Don't Eat the Daisies" is the story of a New York City family, the Mackays - four boys, a wife Kate (Doris Day) and her husband Larry (David Niven). Suddenly, Larry finds success as a powerful theater critic, and Kate wants to move out to the country, which was always their dream. However, it's not really Larry's dream any longer. He's heady on New York success and wants to be near Theater Row. Conflict comes with his changing values.This is a nice story co-starring Spring Byington as Kate's mother and Patsy Kelly as the family housekeeper. It doesn't compare with the sparkling Doris-Rock comedies. I happen to like David Niven in the role he's what you would expect from a New York critic - above it all,sophisticated, egotistical, well-educated but ultimately likable.Day is very good as always and gets to sing, but the whole thing is a little too much. There aren't enough laughs to make it really funny. The brightest part of the movie for me was Janis Paige as Deborah Vaughn, an actress/singer decimated by Mackay in a review who then becomes attracted to him. She looks gorgeous, she's sexy, and she supplies the bite that the story needed more of. If the writers had built up that part of the story, the movie might have turned out better. The other part they could have built up is the awful play that Larry wrote that ends up being produced by the local community theater. Some scenes from that with Doris would have been great.Day, as it turned out, was at her best when Ross Hunter made her over into a glamorous, sophisticated woman herself and teamed her up with Rock Hudson and gave her glossy productions and great clothes. This film was made was right at that transition. Day is a very vibrant presence but she can't elevate this material to more than what it was - a pleasant family comedy.</p>
