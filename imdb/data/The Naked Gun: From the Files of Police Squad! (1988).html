<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>ZAZ's(David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker) The Naked Gun is one of the funniest (if not funniest) film ever with more parodies and gags than one could ever imagine.  And the writing is if not good, great that never lets up (even through the finale baseball game with Reggie Jackson).  But what really gets this film up there is it's main characters.  Leslie Nielson has never been better and probably won;t ever be this good ever again.  He brings an insane type of humor from a cop that hasn't been seen since Clouseau.  The supporting characters are good also, including Priscilla Pressley, George Kennedy, Ricardo Montebaum, Nancy Marchand and (odd to see him in a movie today) OJ Simpson.  There zany characters and added with a great script make this a treasure in cinema comedy.  One of the best films of the 80's.  A++</p>
