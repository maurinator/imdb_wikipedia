<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I will be one of the first to admit that Bing Crosby made a lot of schmaltzy films. Yet, oddly, they worked! Here is yet another one of his films filled with treacle that you can't help but like! Somehow, he was able to make this work again and again--even if he was 50 and way too old for this part.The film begins shortly before WWII. Bing is visiting France and falls in love with a woman and marries her. They choose to remain in the country--which is a mistake, as the Nazis soon take over and he and his wife are separated. He is evacuated from Dunkirk and she begins working for the French underground. Unfortunately, she is captured and executed--but what has happened to their young son? Most of the film consists of Bing looking for the boy after the war. The path leads to a young orphan who MAY be his kid--but it's never at all certain. What's next? See the film.The film has many heartwarming moments and also some decent acting. Not a brilliant film but quite satisfying.</p>
