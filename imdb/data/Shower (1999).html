<h1>Shower (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shenzhen businessman, Da Ming, goes home to Beijing when he thinks his father has died. He finds his father hard at work at the family's bathhouse (the false message was a ruse of Da's mentally-handicapped, exuberant brother, Er Ming, to get Da home). Da stays a couple days, observing his father being social director, marriage counselor, and dispute mediator for his customers and a boon companion to Er. Da is caught between worlds: the decaying district of his childhood and the booming south where he now lives with a wife who's not met his family. When Da realizes his father's health is failing and the district is slated for razing, he must take stock of family and future.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a very enjoyable film.  A humorous, but poignant look at family, and the obligations that come with it.  The story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small Chinese village.  There he learns to appreciate, even cherish the very things he left home to get away from.  The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.</p>
