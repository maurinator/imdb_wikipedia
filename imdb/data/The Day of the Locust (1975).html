<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Can you believe that back in the dark ages of the 1970s, UK fleapits would run double bills like Chinatown/Day of the Locust? Two of the finest films of the 70s in a single sitting was quite an experience. I've never forgotten either movie. I've seen Chinatown on TV a couple of times, but The Day of the Locust is still vividly imprinted in my mind from 1975. It's one of the most harrowing visions of the rancid side of the American dream ever committed to celluloid. A real masterpiece of design, script, ensemble playing, cinematography and direction. Humanity at its most despicable and malignantly deranged has rarely been captured as majestically as this.</p>
