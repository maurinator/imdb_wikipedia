<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fausto Moretti, having seduced Sandra Rubini, the sister of his friend and companion Moraldo Rubini, is forced to marry her. After their honeymoon, he takes a job as a salesman of religious objects in a small shop. He isn't changed by his marriage and still looks for women, with his friends, when and where they can find them. He even tries to seduce the wife of his boss and is fired. After each episode, Sandra forgives him. He and his friends of similar temperament are content to be idle, chase girls and leave the work and job-hunting to others. After spending the night away from home with a girl, Sandra cannot forgive anymore and runs off with their child. Fausto and his friends search all over for them, fearing the worst.</p>
<p>Alberto, Fausto, Leopoldo, Moraldo and Riccardo are young adult friends, living in a provincial coastal Italian town. Most are still living at home, unemployed, spending their time together amusing themselves in whatever means, which they find difficult in what they consider their boring town, needing to sponge money off their loved ones. They are mostly aimless, although Leopoldo, the intellectual, writes, mostly plays, and Riccardo sings whenever given the opportunity. The first one forced at least to start to grow up is Fausto, the cad, who gets Sandra, Moraldo's naive sister, pregnant. Although he was going to run off to Milan and abandon her, Fausto instead marries her after his father finds out about the pregnancy. Fausto and Sandra will find if the sheer act of being married and parents will make Fausto truly grow up, or if their example of being married will get any of the five friends out of their inertia, most specifically by leaving town to strike out on their own.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The genesis of "I Vitelloni" occurred at a critical time for Federico Fellini. His previous film, "The White Sheik" had been met with such disappointment by critics and audiences that his directoral career was in jeopardy. So, with the need for a successful production on his head, Fellini decided to make a simple comedy...!The simple story of the five "loafers" and "dreamers" could have been maudlin and trite, but in the hands of Fellini, the story unfolds like a beautiful flower as part of an overall powerful, moving experience. Few directors have communicated their personal vision and experience as intensely as did Fellini. While there is dispute as to whether there is a direct correlation of the character of Moraldo to Fellini himself, Fellini puts us comfortably into his shoes and we connect with Moraldo's frustrations, aspirations, and eventually, his exodus.With "I Vitteloni", Fellini began to hit his stride of 10 years of greatness, culminating in "Otto e Mezzo". The episodic character exploration of the latter years isn't as dominant here, but the allusions to people, places, and things are presented in full force. The story is easier to follow than later films and is a more central part of the film. This coherence is easier to grasp, making it more accessible for the Fellini neophyte.But, with all of the talk about Fellini, this is still a magnificent movie that stands on its own. See it.</p>
