<h1>Malpertuis (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Malpertuis is a labyrinth where characters issued from the Greek mythology are made prisoners by Cassavius. He manages to keep them (as well as his nephew and niece) as prisoners even after his death, through a binding testament. As the nephew unravels the mystery, we find out he cannot escape the house because Malpertuis is far more significant than we were led to believe.</p>
<p>A young sailor finds himself trapped in the labyrinthine mansion of his occultist uncle, along with a number of eccentric and mysterious relatives who all seem to be harboring a dark secret.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have just viewed, for the first time, this incredible film on a very poor quality video tape, released by MPV, Motion Pictures on Video in 1987 and running ninety minutes. Having only ever read about this work in an encyclopedia of Horror cinema, nothing could have prepared me for this intense, captivating vision which induced feelings of great humbleness, childlike wonderment and joy in this adult viewer.  Film as art, beautiful, haunting, arresting the senses like little else. The only other comparable works i have witnessed to use colour and lighting to create such a rich and complete composed effect, as is in evidence throughout this sublime and surreal trip, are the films of : Michael Powell and Martin Scorsese. The Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffman, Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. Or David Lynch's Blue Velvet and David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch. Or Dario Argento's Suspiria and Inferno. All of whom, bar Michael Powell, must surely have been influenced by Malpertuis.  This then is a heart felt plea to Anchor Bay / Blue Underground / Criterion Collection to do whatever is necessary to track down this lost treasure, to the ends of the earth if required, and make it available on the highest quality dvd release possible. I understand there exists at least two versions, great, make it a double disc affair track down Harry KÃ¼mel for a commentary track and make this and many other lovers of the moving image, very very happy. My score an assured 10 / 10</p>
