<h1>Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An animated, magical, musical version of Dickens' timeless classic "A Christmas Carol." The nearsighted Mr. Magoo doesn't have a ghost of a chance as Ebenezer Scrooge, unless he learns the true meaning of Christmas from the three spirits who haunt him one Christmas Eve.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this last year for the first time in at least 30 years, and also still remember parts of it from when I was a child (razzleberry dressing, the "Despicable" song in the junkshop, and the achingly poignant "All Alone in the World").  My 8 year old really enjoyed it, a great intro to the classic story.  He commented on how sad he felt for the young Scrooge in the schoolhouse scene.  To see a modern kid as moved by that song as I remember being, is a real credit to the songwriter.  And, the song in the Crachit house, where despite not being able to afford a tree or a holiday meal, they "prize what we have now" by having a loving family together for the holiday. What wonderful concepts presented in a simple yet effective holiday cartoon for kids and adults.</p>
