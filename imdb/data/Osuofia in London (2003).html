<h1>Osuofia in London (2003)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny! It seamlessly interweaves the story of two very different people - a Nigerian villager and a proper British woman with coherence, continuity and content that most Nigerian movieslack. Each of Usuofia and Samantha has the opportunity to live in the other's domain (see part 2) and the movie does justice to the cultural difficulties experienced by each. Well worth your time.To thoroughly enjoy this movie (and its sequel), one would have to be vaguely familiar with the Nigerian culture. Anyone however, can understand and follow what's happening.Downside: there are relatively high variations in volume and noise levels throughout the movie making some of what is said difficult to decipher; some of the camera shots were also wacky. If you can ignore those few things, you're in for a ride!</p>
