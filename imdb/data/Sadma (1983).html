<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After reading all the above comments I also felt like to comment on the film that I grown up watching. I watched this film when I was just 8yrs. old and one scene that still fresh in my mind is the climax. It is so heart wrenching and sad that you just can't stop the tears blow out of your eyes. Though I watched the film several more times but you can understand the magic of this film which left a strong impact in 8 yrs' old boy's mind. Kamal Hasan and Sridevi are at their best in the film. And Another clap for the superb directions of Balu Mahendru & Hrishida. Film's music also out of the time and goes pretty well with the film's each and every scene. What more to say, just watch it for your own sake if you are a true cine-lover.</p>
