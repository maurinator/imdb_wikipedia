<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Freddie Heflin is a sheriff in a New Jersey suburb mainly populated by NYPD cops seeking a break from the big city.  Freddie lives in awe of the cops, unable to join due to deafness in one ear.  However he is forced to confront Donlan and his colleagues when an IA officer Tilden begins to investigate the killing of two unarmed black men by, and subsequent suicide of Donlan's nephew Murray Babitch.This `independent' thriller boast a deep cast and certainly had a lot to shout about in the run up to it's release.  The problem is with the actual story that the film has to work with.  The start is exciting with Babitch's killing of two black motorists but it is also quite stretched.  Similarly the denouncement is exciting but is quite easy to see it coming.  However the middle section is good, as it relies on the characters and the actors to develop the story - although there is probably too much history to squeeze into a short time.Stallone proves that he can act, being excellent in a particularly unglamorous role, carrying extra weight for the part and looking like he took lessons from De Niro.  The rest of the cast would find it hard to be bad - De Niro and Harvey Keitel rekindle their Scorsese partnership and both are good here.  Liotta, Rapaport, Patrick and Sciorra are all excellent in smaller roles.  Even small roles are played by heavyweights - Emmerich, Moriarty, Spencer, Vincent and Garofalo (who only seems to have 2 scenes!)Overall the film benefits from a fantastic cast but needed a much stronger plot to justify the depth of the performances.</p>
