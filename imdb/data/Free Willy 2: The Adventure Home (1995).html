<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I catched this on satellite before trying to watch a video from my watchlist collection. Because of it's charm I couldn't get my self to stop watching it. Aware and knowing that it has a sequel-B movie vibe on it.That being said I think this movie is pretty decent for it's level. Though not being the ambitious "I want to be a big franchise" type of movie. It still has a well thought plot. And I think those are enough for a good family moment.For size, you can see how the camera works to find the emotion of Willy the whale. Making it live enough to enjoy.</p>
