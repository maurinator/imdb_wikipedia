<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Funny little time burner has Paul Hogan starring as an Australian outlaw in the U.S. old west. A robbery leads to him kidnapping a young black mute man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). They become the strangest of friends and have the wildest adventures as they try to become known criminals in a time and place that just does not seem to care about them. High-class prostitutes Beverly D'Angelo and Kamala Lopez-Dawson are also along as the duo's love interests. The film uses its gimmick well early, but then starts to drag as it hits its latter acts. Hogan and Gooding make a surprisingly impressive team, but really they were not given enough material to run with. The rest of the cast is touch and go as once again Hogan is left to carry a production and he is only minimally successfully. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
