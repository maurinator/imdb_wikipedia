<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have a large collection of sword fight movies, and bought this one on ebay to complete my collection. This movie looks to me like a relatively low-budget movie that was shot on location with an actual castle, but interior sets (painted stone walls). But it must have been done in another language because the entire audio track is dubbed into English (at least the NTSC version for USA and Canada). I tried watching some of the film with 'mute' on the TV and I'm quite certain that they are not just re-dubbing the English. The downfalls of this film are many starting with the poor camera work that uses zoom instead of camera movements, etc. The story moves very slowly, the costumes are the old 'wool' chain mail, but has otherwise some decent clothing. The actors themselves look like they could be good but have to act with poor story and direction. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch this film.... but after continuing the next day, at least there was a castle battle and sword fight finish. Unfortunately, this was lessened by the choice by the studio to put slow music over most of the exciting parts, so that they would not have to 'foley' the battle scenes. A slight plus was a tournament scene with jousting on horseback. With original soundtrack and voices I might give it a 5/10, but this version gets a 2/10.</p>
