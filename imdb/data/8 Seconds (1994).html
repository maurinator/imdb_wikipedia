<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>8 Seconds is probably my favorite film. It's not the best film on Earth, mind you; but it's the one I like watching the most. Luke Perry does a great job of portraying Lane Frost. It's a definite must-see for people who like films about love and friendship. The love story between Lane and Kelly shows all their ups and downs, through all of Lane's successes and failures (which happen in conjunction with the ups and downs in their personal lives). Then there is the friendship between Lane and Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin), which shows through even when Tuff is being hard on him. The film manages to avoid a lot of sentimentality and cliche film making. Worth your while to check it out.</p>
