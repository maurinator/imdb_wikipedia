<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Money Talks was a worthwhile action/comedy that was enjoyable. Charlie Sheen and Chris Tucker made a great duo. Money Talks was also notable for being Brett Ratner's directorial debut, who would also go on to direct the Rush Hour trilogy, The Family Man, and Red Dragon.Franklin Hatchett (Chris Tucker) is a small time hustler who is exposed by reporter James Russell (Charlie Sheen) on camera and arrested by police. While Franklin is transported to jail on a prison bus, the bus is intercepted by mercenaries and Franklin is dragged onto a helicopter while handcuffed to another prisoner. When Franklin hears a plot to locate a cache of stolen diamonds, he manages to jump out of the helicopter when the mercenaries also plan to murder him. Franklin must also evade the police following his escape from custody as well as being framed for the murder of several police officers. Franklin enlists the help of James Russell, the reporter who initially put him in prison, for protection and to clear his name.Chris Tucker was a standout for this comedy. He was hilarious! Chris Tucker would also reunite with Brett Ratner for the Rush Hour trilogy. Charlie Sheen was also good to see as reporter James Russell.Also starring Heather Locklear, Paul Sorvino, David Warner, and Paul Gleason, Money Talks was an enjoyable comedy from start to finish. It was good to see Brett Ratner go on to build a career as a popular director.7/10.</p>
