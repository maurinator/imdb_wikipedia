<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen this movie in probably 12 years, but if I remember well, it relates the story of a poor Italian girl who wants to be an actress and has to sleep left and right to get there.  She even ends up being the mistress of "Il Duce" (Mussolini).In any case, it's a very funny movie with the beautiful Agostina Belli in the title role, and memorable vignettes with Vittorio Gassman and Ugo Tognazzi.  If you like broad Italian comedy, you'll like this movie.</p>
