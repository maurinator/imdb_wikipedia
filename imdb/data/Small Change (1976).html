<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Small Change is a movie about the many children in a French town.  It will irritate those who want a strong plot line.  Although there are a couple continuing threads, particularly about a boy facing physical abuse at home, the film is mostly episodic and jumps randomly among dozens of children and unconnected events.  In that sense, it is sort of like the way we tend to remember our own childhoods.  I liked the approach.There are several memorable sequences.  I enjoyed the girl who wants to go out to dinner on her own terms and the spur of the moment "double date" at the movie theater.One of the strengths of Small Change is that doesn't try to play up the cuteness of the child actors or overly-sentamentalize its subject matter. It is about the frustrations as well as the small joys of childhood.  The adult characters are also very realistic, some of whom like kids and some of whom don't.  The school teachers are the most sympathetic, one of whom seems to articulate the film's theme in a strong a monologue near the end.</p>
