<h1>Footloose (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Classic tale of teenage rebellion and repression features a delightful combination of dance choreography and realistic and touching performances. When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and "Let's Hear It for the Boy".</p>
<p>A city teenager moves to a small town where rock music and dancing have been banned, and his rebellious spirit shakes up the populace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>for those of you that have commented that this story is dumb.  It was based on a real story. Check the net.Having grown up in a small town in the bible belt this story is very believable.  In fact, in some rural areas in the bible belt, many homes dont have running water! So, don't be so quick to say it isn't believable.Good movie, good music, nothing else to say.</p>
