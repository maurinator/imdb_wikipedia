<h1>Careful (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Alpine village of Tolzbad in the 1800s, the townsfolk talk quietly and restrain their movements lest they incur avalanches. This atmosphere lends itself to repressed emotions - shown through the parallel stories of butler student Johann lusting after his mother (an old flame of the mysterious Count Knotkers) and Klara's attraction to her father (who lusts after his other daughter), leading to duels and suicidal plunges galore. All this is shot in the style of an early German sonal film, complete with intertitles, crackly sound-track and 'hand-tinted' colour effects.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Careful" is to Guy Maddin what "Eraserhead" was to David Lynch. Its his most pure and psychologically fascinating film, and while it isn't accessible to most, its also possibly his finest achievement. Guy Maddin creates surrealist films made in the style of classic films. This in particular resembles a Technicolor (and occasionally tinted) version of a German expressionist film with sound. Still, the highly sexual subject matter sets it far apart from any film of that era. Also, Maddin has a very droll sense of humor that borders on camp but never feels gimmicky. His dialog which mocks clich√©s will have the viewer in stitches if they appreciate the bizarre. "Careful" is the ultimate film of one of today's most visionary and unique filmmakers."Careful" is a surreal masterpiece for several reasons. The film maintains a consistent hallucinogenic appearance. It resembles early cinema as noted above, but absolutely nothing else made nowadays. Maddin obsessively recreates the look and feel of those films at times and admirably so. He also seems to be able to recapture the distorted and confused mindset of the Expressionist era, except with a post-modern sense. I mean, there's no silent film I can think of where one of the protagonists takes cuts off his fingers in a gory fashion on camera. "Careful" is Maddin's best work and an absolute must for those with a taste for the bizarre and original. (9/10)</p>
