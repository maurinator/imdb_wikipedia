<h1>Graffiti Bridge (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Graffiti Bridge is the unofficial sequel to Purple Rain. In this movie, The Kid and Morris Day are still competitors and each runs a club of his own. They make a bet about who writes the best song and the Kid's club is on the line. But the Kid has become a brooding character who writes letters to his dead father and ponders spirituality. Under the Graffiti Bridge in the park, he meets Aura, an angel-like poet with whom he falls in love. Once again, Morris tries to steal his girl, and in the end, she dies in a tragic accident. But not in vain, she has given the Kid his edge back, and Morris gives in and lets him keep the club after hearing the moving ballad the Kid composed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"graffiti bridge" follows on from "purple rain" prince's movie debut. It is quite a cult film and will only appeal to a limited audience. Visually it is very pleasant to the eye with more delicate choreography than in "purple rain" and musically its a real treat with a sound embraced in the technology of that era, but still lavished with prince's unique musical style. this movie expands on prince's spiritual ethos and retains a quirky mix of childlike innocence and adult sexuality. This movie is quite visionary for musicians as it offers some insight into the need for spiritual direction in music, as in all art. i enjoyed the movie and if you enjoyed movies such as "purple rain" or "interstella 5555" then i think you would probably enjoy this one.</p>
