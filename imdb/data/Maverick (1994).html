<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maverick is just a good time movie with Mel Gibson doing a great job in the title role. James Garner as the elder,who used the name Zane cooper,was flawless, and Jodie Foster played a great part too. It's a great escape movie for 2 hours and filled with just as much comedy as it is with action. A great film to watch-Magictrain</p>
