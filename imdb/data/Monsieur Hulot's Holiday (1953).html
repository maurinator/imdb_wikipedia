<h1>Monsieur Hulot's Holiday (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Monsieur Hulot goes on a holiday to a seaside resort, but accidents and misunderstandings follow him where ever he goes. The peace and quiet of the hotel guests don't last very long with Hulot around, because although his intensions are good, they always turn out catastrophically.</p>
<p>The summer holidays have arrived and the bumbling Monsieur Hulot - along with everyone else - heads for the seaside. Hulot is something of an innocent. Pretty well everything he touches goes bad but he is oblivious to the havoc he creates everywhere he goes. Whether it be eating in the dining room, painting a boat or playing tennis, his life is an adventure for everyone around him.</p>
<p>It's the summer holiday season in Europe, and M. Hulot, like many others, has decided to spend his vacation at the French seaside, specifically at l'Hotel de la Plage resort. Quite often with a pipe in his mouth, Hulot is a pretty quiet fellow, but that still does not stop him from getting into a lot of trouble while there. Although he does get along with many of the other resort guests - such as the Englishwoman who is amazed at the effectiveness of his unique tennis style, or the beautiful Martine - most, unfortunately, must deal with the bad outcomes of his unintentionally bumbling, albeit good-natured, actions. On the most part, Hulot is unaware of what problems he is causing as he lives primarily in the moment of only what he himself is doing.</p>
<p>Monsieur Hulot comes to a beachside hotel for a vacation, where he accidentally (but good-naturedly) causes havoc.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Mr. Hulot's Holiday" is a terrific comedy. But be warned, it is also deliberately paced, almost lacking in dialog, and absolutely plot less. In order for you to enjoy this film, you must not wait for the "story" to begin--there is not one. In fact, the film is not much more than a series of sight gags held together by a single set of characters and a single locale--but as such, it is brilliant.Director/Star Tati's work in the Hulot films was an obvious influence on the solo films of Jerry Lewis a decade later. It is amazing that the French purportedly think Lewis a genius when in fact his best films (such as "The Bellboy," "The Ladies Man," "The Errand Boy," etc) borrow from the Tati style to the point of plagiarism.Well, the original is better, and you don't have to endure the constant mugging.</p>
