<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the story by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, this magical musical fable begins as a pilot makes a forced landing on the barren Sahara Desert. He is befriended by a "little" prince from the planet Asteroid B-612. In the days that follow, the pilot learns of the small boy's history and planet-hopping journeys in which he met a King, a businessman, an historian, and a general. It isn't until he comes to Earth that the Little Prince learns the secrets of the importance of life from a Fox, a Snake, and the pilot.</p>
<p>A pilot, stranded in the desert, meets a little boy who is a prince on a planet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Le Petit Prince has been, and may still be, required reading for French students.  It is difficult to make a satisfactory film of such a literary icon; it is dangerous to try to make it a musical, as well.  I think this film is highly under-rated, and perhaps mostly by people who are not very familiar with its original source.  While much of the film could be considered "hokey", I believe that the "dance" sequence of the pilot and the Prince in the spring is sheer delight (as their finding the source of water must have been).  Fosse's Snake and Wilder's Fox are phenomenal:  it doesn't take long for one to actually believe that they are animals rather than people portraying animals. This is a must-see for all, especially for those with children (they seem to "get it" faster than many adults.</p>
