<p>In Rio, Orfeo is a trolley conductor and musician, engaged to Mira. During Carnival week, he sees Eurydice, who's fled her village in fear of a stalker; it's love at first sight.

Later, during the revels, wearing Sarafina's costume, Eurydice dances a provocative samba with Orfeo. Not only is Mira enraged when her rival is unmasked, but she is being stalked by Death: Eurydice is in danger, pursued through noisy crowds and a morgue. Can Orfeo conduct her to safety? Don't look back.</p>
<p>A retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, set during the time of the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the only movies that has ever made me weep. It seems a little contrived in the beginning when all the characters just happen to be named after mythological characters, but by the end of the movie, one forgets all about how the movie could have been corny.  It's definitely the best subtitled film I've seen, and I hope more people vote on it so that it can get on the top 250.</p>
