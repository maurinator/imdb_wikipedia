<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow! This is without a doubt the best episode of this series so far. Several "huh?" moments, a few "What the hell??" scenes and one big "Whoa! I did NOT see that coming!!" After breaking and telling Monroe everything, Nora is smuggled out by Sanborn (huh?) Monroe wants to kill Flynn but Flynn convinces Monroe that he needs him to access The Tower as if Flynn thinks he isn't just delaying his execution - (what thehell??). Rachel plans on sacrificing herself to kill Monroe and get Aaron into the tower at the same time (another what the hell??). But the BIG storyline is Miles, Nora et. al. heading to The Tower via a pendant-ized chopper. They set down in an old military airfield to find fuel, but as they separate to search, the pilot is found murdered and the chopper sabotaged, apparently by one of them. They all accuse someone in the group; loyalties are tested and everyone appears to be a suspect (recalling the old Clue board game which I assume gives this episode its title). I knew without question who was responsible and when the culprit was revealed that was my "Whoa! I did NOT see that coming!!" moment. Oh, and did I mention that this episode ends with a major cliffhanger? 10 stars</p>
