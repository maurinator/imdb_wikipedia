<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have always been very interested in the mob from early 1900 to the 50's. This film didn't disappoint me, probably because I wasn't expecting much. I knew this film was just made in order to get 4 young rising actors on screen together. Those actors being Christian Slater whom would later go to star in Brocken Arrow with John Trovolta. Patrick Dempsey who plays Meyer Lansky, Richard Grieco who plays Bugsy Siegel (The man who made Las Vegas) and Costas Mandylor as Frank Costello.The film feels very rushed and it seems the producers were more interested in the action rather than story which is interesting on its own. THe characters arnt developed very well but as someone who has read up on all of them I felt as if I already knew them. Christian Slater does the best but looks nothing like the real Luciano. The film was too short running in at around 105 minutes. I think the director's and writers should have sat down and watched GOODFELLAS which was made the year before.</p>
