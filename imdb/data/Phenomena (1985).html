<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>for years this dario argento film has only been available in america in a butchered 82 minute version called Creepers. anchor bay entertainment graciously decided to rerelease this movie in its almost uncut 110 min. version (almost meaning that it's still missing 6 minutes of dialogue from the italian version) and it is definitely the version to see. jennifer connelly plays a girl sent away to a swiss boarding school where a killer has been murdering girls in various ways. jennifer has the most unique ability to communicate with insects and this ability plays heavily into later events in the movie. donald pleasance plays a retired professor who studies insects who befriends connelly ( and his pet monkey almost steals the film) the events that transpire in the film are surreal yet somewhat coherent. like most of argento's films, notably Suspiria, this movie has an almost dreamlike feel to it. it may not make complete sense at times but the style definitely saves it.i would have to rank this as my second favorite argento movie (with Suspiria being first and Tenebre being third). and remember not to rent american version titled Creepers and check out the original version.</p>
