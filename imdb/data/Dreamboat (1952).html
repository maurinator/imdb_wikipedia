<h1>Dreamboat (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Thornton Sayre, a respected college professor, is plagued when his old movies are shown on TV and sets out with his daughter to stop it. However, his former co-star is the hostess of the TV show playing his films and she has other plans.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This delightful spoof is pure joy, elevated by a spanking story (by John D. Weaver) deft direction and scripting (by Claude Binon) and cracking cast (headed by Clifton Webb and Ginger Rogers). What's great is that this comedy doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is: an amusing trifle with nifty observations about the film, television and radio industries. One of our favorites, it's also to date (2004) not available on vhs, dvd, or shown on tv. Production Studio Twentieth Century Fox must know something we don't.</p>
