<h1>Hans Christian Andersen (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A completely fabricated biography of the famous Danish fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen featuring several of his stories and a ballet performance of "The Little Mermaid".</p>
<p>The opening scene of the movie describes it best: "Once upon a time there lived in Denmark a great storyteller named Hans Christian Andersen. This is not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about the great spinner of fairy tales."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was the movie that caused me to fall in love with Danny Kaye.  I still love watching  this movie more than 20 years after I saw it for the first time on television.  I love his  gentle nature with the children, in particular the little girl he sings "Thumbalina" to.   Fabricated or not, this is one of his best films showing the true diversity of an incredibly  talented man.  Danny Kaye was surely one of the last of a dying Hollywood breed.</p>
