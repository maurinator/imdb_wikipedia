<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Will Cole is a charismatic 35 year old paper mill laborer who seems to celebrate a life of bad choices.

Surprisingly enough, despite his devil-may-care attitude, he has several important people in his life. He maintains a special relationship with Stan, an old mentor who lives in a nursing home, and Ruth, the only woman he truly cares about. Andrew is his best friend but grows tired of Will's antics, and he is soon to be married and moving on. Will constantly has something up his sleeve but his pranks inevitably bring pain and tragedy to those closest to him, forcing him to reevaluate his life and make some difficult decisions.</p>
<p>A man who refuses to grow up and take responsibility has his world crash down on him when his friends suffer as a result of his antics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found everything about this film to be beautiful.  Beautiful writing, beautiful direction, beautiful characters, beautiful scenery.  I had heard a great deal about it, and the only way I could see it was to buy it.  I'm so glad I did!</p>
