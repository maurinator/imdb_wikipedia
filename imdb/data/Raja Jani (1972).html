<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Raja Jani" should have been called Rani Jani or something. It is quite an enjoyable flick of 1970's Hindi cinema: very colourful, very entertaining, basically the perfect one for nostalgic fans of the genre and the time. This film starts with Raja (Dharmendra) who tries to find a girl who would be a perfect impostor to take the place of the missing princess Ratna. During an assassination of her parents she disappeared, and during the last ten years her grandmother, queen Rajmata has been looking for her. Raja finds a street dancer named Shanno, and finally, after extensive training, she enters the house as the long awaited princess. What he does not know is something that may spoil his intentions to get the money through her, and it is revealed later (you may guess what it could be). Well, the story is narrated nicely - nothing exceptional but still interesting enough. Dharmendra is very good as Raja, but the film belongs to Hema Malini, who is also the film's main and perhaps only attraction. She is such a beautiful lady, such a talented actress, and such an awesome comedienne that whether the film is particularly good or not does not matter. Raja Jani has been with me since childhood, and I still like it and attribute this to Hema Malini.</p>
