<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As one might expect, the film is a bit dated but nonetheless compelling. When I first saw Night Watch I was completely mesmerized by Liz Taylor's performance. The "murder scenes" that she observed from her window at night were used masterfully by the director. I believe that the director of "What Lies Beneath" must surely have paid homage to this classic because several scenes are strikingly similar. The tension builds slowly as does the mystery until you're shown the knife rack in the kitchen with the one missing knife. About that time you're beginning to wish you'd opted for the Disney film. The film's last 10 minutes of frenzy are etched forever in my mind and come to the forefront whenever I try to recall truly terrifying moments in cinema. I do hope that future generations will be able to experience this film even though it hasn't had the notoriety so many other films have enjoyed.</p>
