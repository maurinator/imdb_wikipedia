<h1>Onegin (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the opulent St. Petersburg of the Empire period, Eugene Onegin is a jaded but dashing aristocrat - a man often lacking in empathy, who suffers from restlessness, melancholy and, finally, regret. Through his best friend Lensky, Onegin is introduced to the young Tatiana. A passionate and virtuous girl, she soon falls hopelessly under the spell of the aloof newcomer and professes her love for him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although I saw this film several months ago, its images and characters remain vividly with me.  Martha Fiennes, as a first time feature director, certainly understands the visual medium she is dealing with.  The scenes of snow and mist over water, are a significant contrast to the sumptuous indoor scenes, as though nature itself reflects  what lies in the human heart...that all the wealth and lavishness created by man cannot assuage.  Ms Fiennes very wisely saw this verse play as a vehicle for her talented brother, Ralph.  His ability to portray a brooding, alienated...yet passionate man is extraordinary, in my opinion.  Although Liv Tyler is very beautiful and was a knock-out in that red ball dress, I wasn't as convinced by her performance as others who have posted here.  I would have preferred an English actress, Polly Walker, perhaps.  In any case, I loved this film and have every intention of seeing it again.</p>
