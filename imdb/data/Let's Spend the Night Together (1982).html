<h1>Let's Spend the Night Together (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Rolling Stones' shows in Tempe, Arizona and East Rutherford, New Jersey during their 1981 US tour.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Forget what critics say about this one, it's a rock 'n' roll concert NOTcinema verit√© and that's all I want from The Stones. Filmed at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona (outdoors segment) andthe Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey (indoor segment) bydirector Hal Ashby ("Harold And Maude", "Coming Home") in the fall of1981 on the Stones' very successful Tattoo You Tour. This is the last tour to feature the basic meat and potatoes Stones lineup(guitar, bass, drums, piano, sax) as every subsequent tour since has featured  an musical entourage of 3 or 4 backup singers, big horn sections andmultiple keyboardists.  The material is great although I wish they'd haveplayed "Gimme Shelter", "Monkey Man", "Street Fighting Man", "Bitch"but hey, those songs were not performed on that tour so what are yougonna do? I would have liked more backstage activity but then again that's what the"C*cks*cker Blues" 1972 film by Robert Frank does to excess. "Let's Spend The Night Together" perfectly captures the Stones as theywere in 1981 in their late 30s and early 40s and is a must for any RollingStones fan.4 - 1/2 STARS out of 5</p>
