<h1>The Black Orchid (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After mobsters murder her husband, Rose Bianco works long hours making artificial flowers, to support herself and her son. Some suspect that Rose's demand for a lavish lifestyle pushed her husband to a life of crime, and they blame her for his death. Widower Frank Valente is attracted to Rose, and must convince her that real love exists. He must also deal with his own daughter, who has her own reasons for opposing his marriage to Rose.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The soon-to-be-married daughter of a handsome widower is furious when her father starts dating the widow of a gangster. Anthony Quinn and Sophia Loren are quite good as the older lovers whose romance hits a family obstacle (Quinn, in particular, is well-attuned to his role), but the stereotypical Italian characters get to be a bit much. One can understand why Quinn's daughter is reluctant to let go of her papa (she's been mother and daughter to him for years), but her overwrought behavior--not to mention her over-acting--creates an hysterical mood which nearly undermines the love story. Martin Ritt directed, staging the piece with sensitivity yet never allowing the characters and their emotions to bloom. **1/2 from ****</p>
