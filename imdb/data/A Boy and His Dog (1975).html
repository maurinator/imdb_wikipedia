<h1>A Boy and His Dog (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A post-apocalyptic tale based on a novella by Harlan Ellison. A boy communicates telepathically with his dog as they scavenge for food and sex, and they stumble into an underground society where the old society is preserved. The daughter of one of the leaders of the community seduces and lures him below, where the citizens have become unable to reproduce because of being underground so long. They use him for impregnation purposes, and then plan to be rid of him.</p>
<p>Don Johnson plays a young man in a post nuclear war world who has an interesting friend, a telepathic dog. The dog gives him an advantage in dealing with the barbaric world he lives in. When Johnson finds one place that has escaped the devastation of the war, he also finds some rather odd attitudes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After WW III Vic (Don Johnson) and his dog Blood (played by Tiger from "The Brady Bunch" TV show) travel around looking for women for Vic to rape and food for Blood. They talk telepathically--Vic hears Blood's voice in his mind and talks aloud back to him. Eventually they meet Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton) who's from an underground city called Topeka. She urges him to come down with her but Blood senses there is something wrong...This is extremely low budget but not bad. The conversations between Vic and Blood are hilarious (and Blood's face and movements totally match the dialogue). Love the bit when Blood asks Vic to name the presidents (remember, this came out in 1975). He responds "Nixon, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy..." When they meet Quilla (about an hour in) the film falls apart. The sequences down under are, at first, scary but get quickly repetitious. But it leads up to a twist ending which is great.This was issued in 1975 with a horribly exploitive ad campaign. It showed a woman lying down on the ground. You don't see her face--just her body and all she's wearing is a shirt and covering her breasts and other parts. Blood has a paw on her and a proud look on his face and Vic is standing beside him holding a gun! The implication is obvious and the rape aspect of this bothered a lot of people. It was reissued in the early 80s (that's when I saw it) with a totally different ad campaign. I understand why people are upset with the rape theme but this is a science-fiction fantasy--don't take this too seriously.The acting is good. Johnson was, surprisingly, dead perfect as Vic. Tiger was great:) Benton also is pretty good and Jason Robards pops up late in the proceedings.Not a perfect film but an interesting one. I give it a 7.</p>
