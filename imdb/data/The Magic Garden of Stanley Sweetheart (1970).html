<h1>The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Robert T. Westbrook, the movie is about 23 year old Columbia University dropout (Stanley Sweetheart) who seeks his identity during the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Plotless, student film (or so it seems) of an aimless, selfish, generally stupid but very sexually active and fairly good looking twenty-three year old (Stanley-a shockingly young Don Johnson) who fancies himself a film maker (as did the maker of this movie; boy was he mistaken!). While living in New York and going to college there, Stanley meets a virginal girl (Cathy), talks her into sex and has a very uninteresting relationship. After some joyful montage sequences, he tires of her. Luckily she has a sexually active roommate and, under the guise of using the roommate for a film, Stanley has sex with her. Via another girl he's had sex with, he meets Danny who tells him not to worry about his infidelity to his girlfriend, to be "free." Having invited Danny and Danny's friends Fran & Andrea to his house, Stanley gets high with them and so does Cathy. She falls for Danny and breaks up with Stanley, who gets angry and realizes he really liked her. Luckily, there's Andrea and Fran and Danny forms a happy, drug-addled threesome with them. Montague joy turns to sorrow as Danny commits suicide, Stanley takes too many drugs, and freedom turns to no-so-subtle metaphoric imprisonment as it is realized that there is no freedom from one's self. This movie has no interesting characters and no story to speak of. Its NYC setting is nightmarish (which it was in the late 60's/70's) and both the directing and acting are terrible.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At university I was part-time apsirant film-maker, part-time aspirant womaniser, and full-time aimless waster.  Unsurprisingly this film struck a huge chord with me, when I stumbled across it during those bewildering days!A great little film, lots of fun, just don't expect any niceties like, erm, a recognisable plot or a meaningful ending.  The film-within-a-film - Stanley's outrageously bad student short "Headless" - is a real hoot and worth the price on its own!Oh and if you like this, check out student rebellion in "The Strawberry Statement" and more of the young Don Johnson in "A boy and his dog", both recommended.</p>
