<h1>The Panic in Needle Park (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie is a stark portrayal of life among a group of heroin addicts who hang out in "Needle Park" in New York City. Played against this setting is a low-key love story between Bobby, a young addict and small-time hustler, and Helen, a homeless girl who finds in her relationship with Bobby the stability she craves. She becomes addicted too, and life goes downhill for them both as their addiction deepens, eventually leading to a series of betrayals. But, in spite of it all, the relationship between Bobby and Helen endures.</p>
<p>Follows the lives of heroin addicts who frequent "Needle Park" in New York City.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen.  It is very real and grisly looking, not polished with the horrible artificial lighting you see nowadays in films.  Bobby and Helen are addicts whose lives are going nowhere, they just can't get out of their destructive lifestyle.  The scenes of the characters shooting up, tricking, and hanging in the brutal streets of 1970's New York are very realistic.  Makes "Trainspotting" look like a Disney cartoon.</p>
