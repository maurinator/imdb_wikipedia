<h1>Thelma & Louise (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Louise is working in a diner as a waitress and has some problems with her boyfriend Jimmy, who, as a musician, is always on the road. Thelma is married to Darryl who likes his wife to stay quiet in the kitchen so that he can watch football on TV. One day they decide to break out of their normal life and jump in the car and hit the road. Their journey, however, turns into a flight when Louise kills a man who threatens to rape Thelma. They decide to go to Mexico, but soon they are hunted by American police.</p>
<p>Whilst on a short weekend getaway, Louise shoots a man who had tried to rape Thelma. Due to the incriminating circumstances, they make a run for it but are soon followed closely by the authorities including a local policeman who is sympathetic to their plight. The federal authorities, however, have less compassion and thus a cross country chase ensues for the two fugitives. Along the way, both women rediscover the strength of their friendship and suprising aspects of their personalities and self-strengths in the trying times.</p>
<p>An Arkansas waitress and a housewife shoot a rapist and take off in a '66 Thunderbird.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The road movie is traditionally a male genre, relying on the sense of freedom and independence that having one's own transport provides and which has usually been the privilege of men What is innovatory about "Thelma & Louise" is the way it reequips the genre for women Thelma (Geena Davis) is a housewife trapped in a meaningless marriage, Louise (Susan Sarandon) is a waitress in a not very significant relationship They decide to give themselves a little space by taking off for a weekend But when Louise shoots a man who is trying to rape Thelma, they are precipitated into a far more radical break with their past lives The setting of action in the American southwest and the acts of outlawry the women are obliged to commit in order to keep on the run give the film some of the feel of a Western What makes it nevertheless a women's film is that the relationship between the two principals is at the center of the story The various men they encounter, both the ones they leave behind and those they meet on the road have less importance for Thelma and Louise than the two women do for each otherPredictably, the film met with hostility from some male viewers, on the grounds that the men were caricatured and that the film encouraged violence</p>
