<h1>The Sting II (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lonnegan is planning to get back at Gondorff and Hooker for bilking him out of half a million. At the same time Gondorff and Hooker are planning their next caper. And their mark is a man named Macalinski, who makes Lonnegan look like a pussycat. There con is boxing match and Hooker is the fighter whom they have to make look good but Macalinski needs some convincing, and Hooker is a little rusty.</p>
<p>Hooker and Gondorff pull a con on Macalinski, an especially nasty mob boss with the help of Veronica, a new grifter. They convince this new victim that Hooker is a somewhat dull boxer who is tired of taking dives for Gondorff. There is a ringer. Lonnegan, their victim from the first movie, is setting them up to take the fall.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good acting.  Good story, but a little confusing at times. Very good photography. Too true of the dark side to be funny. No laughs, but none desired (I presume).</p>
