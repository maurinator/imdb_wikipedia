<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was rubbish. I had heard and read bad reviews of this film but not even they could prepare me for how truly awful this film was. Harrison Ford just couldn't be bothered to act and his character's obsession with his dead wife was very irritating. Very disappointing- what could have been a very good film, ended up very boring, with awful acting and a bad script.</p>
