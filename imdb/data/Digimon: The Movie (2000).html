<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three Japanese movies in one. There is narration by a continuing character, Kari. The first involes an encounter with a digimon of the third kind. The two kids Kari and Tai, raise this fast growing digimon from egg to giant monster. It's a good thing it showed up too, as an awsome fight ends this segment. The second of the movies involves Tai and Izzy. Some sort of computer virus sweeps th internet. It turns out to be a digimon. The digimon are uploaded to the internet and Tai tries to get others to help. Matt and T.K. help as well, with some more outstanding fight scenes. The third and Final segment starts in N.Y. with Kari and T.K., now years older, and they see 2 digimon fighitng and a kid with them. They try to follow him and they get there friends to follow as well. One of the new digimon belongs to Willis, the other, does as well, except this digimon seems to have a virus. The kids find a new power and once again, the fight scenes look spectacular.</p>
<p>Three different stories involving digital creatures collide together.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For an animation, this film was the best I've ever seen. It had exceptional quality throughout and it actually convinced me to watch the television series. I like the way it spans different time lines and explains the whole story, rather than the Pokemon movie. It entertained me every step of the way with a great sound track, dialogue, and characters. The plot seems rather simple when you first hear what it's actually about, but its modern approach makes it original and likeable. The only problem was, the screenplay was a little too quick, even for people who watch the television show, and I lost track in some parts of the movies; in fact, I had to watch it twice to properly understand the entire film. But, everything else aside, I really liked this film and I'd seriously recommend it to anyone, adults or children. If you think it's just another Pokemon movie, you're wrong.</p>
