<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Roger opens the show with a positive review of "Runaway Train", which he liked because of the technical side and the character side, but Gene admitted that he got bored save for Jon Voight's performance. They also review two Michael Douglas pictures, "The Jewel of the Nile" on which they split - Roger liked it Gene didn't, and the film adaptation of "A Chorus Line", which they both liked. Finally two very enthusiastic thumbs up for "28 Up", the latest installment in the series that updates on a group of British school children every seven years.</p>
