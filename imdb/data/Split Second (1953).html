<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stephen McNally, what a mean man. Boy, could he play the bad guy >and almost make you love him. Not to condone his actions in the >flick, but to say that he acted with bravado. He had the knack >for being mean. In this film, he needs to be the "man" to stay >alive, but fate has a way of making humans small. This story is >so tight and well done, that this is a keeper. Next time it's >run turn on the VCR and hit record. It's the kind of flick that >stands up well today by fitting in with the violent control >people will always display when they are criminals on the run. >Beautiful Alexis Smith and sultry Jan Sterling bring out the >animal instincts in the men of the cast. Their looks are just as >persuasive as their acting abilities. This is a "B" movie that >rates an "A+" for showing that it could be done with the right >chemistry of the cast, director and producer. I love this type >of flick!</p>
