<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having never seen the Matrix, but being a loyal anime collector, I came across this high ranked animated feature.Never in my life has I seen something as close as brilliant and poetically nightmarish that Ghost in the Shell has delivered, bringing the Matrix franchise closer to "art and soul" than "blockbuster".Some of the amazingly dramatic episodes in this feature may make Animatrix a parallel brother to Ghost in the Shell itself. And the animation is very dreamy and expertly crafted, the second best thing that this feature will bring you.If anime is your thing, or the matrix, or getting started to both, I couldn't recommend this higher.</p>
