<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I Recently got The Comancheros on DVD and watched it last night. I believe that is the first time that I have seen this film completely. I must admit to having a preference for John Wayne's earlier films from Stagecoach into the late 40's. This was the period when the studios were stills casting John Wayne in assorted roles with greater for lesser degree of success(who could forget him as the Mongolian emperor?) So only recently, I have been rediscovering his great performances in his middle period. But this is about another actor in this film. I just read all the other user comments listed about this film. Several correctly praised the small part played by Lee Marvin. He is always reliable for standout performances. But not any of the comments mentioned the truly standout performance by unknown "Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams" in the part of Ed McBain, the gunrunner. It was a small role but to my thinking probably the best acting in this or many other movies. Well, that's my two cents. "Nuff sed"</p>
