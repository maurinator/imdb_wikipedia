<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the movie that convinced me that Tom Hanks would go on one day to be an Oscar winning actor.  In his last screen appearance, "the great one" Jackie Gleason is perfect as the father who becomes a thorn in his son's side.  With his career in the advertising business going very well, Hanks is forced to care for his seriously ill father when he can as his parents (Oscar winner Eva Marie Saint is his mother) go through a divorce after 35 years together.There are some hilarious jabs at some of the immoral politics contained within the corporate world.  Bess Armstrong, Sela Ward and Hector Elizondo are all excellent in supporting roles.</p>
