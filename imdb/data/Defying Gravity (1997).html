<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was such a wonderful surprise when I saw it in thetheater -- multiple times, in fact.  Candidly, I liked it because I couldreally identify with the character of Griffin.  The chemistry betweenPete and Griff feels very real.  Yes, this is a low-budget film and itsuffers a bit in production values, but the performances are strongand I enjoy it more with each viewing now on DVD.  Some havecriticized it for being cliche, but quite the opposite is true: the film isremarkable because of the absence of stereotypes we've come toexpect in gay-themed art films: drag queens, dysfunctionalfamilies, everyone dying of AIDS, disco music, diva worship,pot-smoking, musical theater fanatics, "sissies," leather daddies,the athletically-challenged...there's none of that here. Griff and Peteare probably the most accurate representation of most gay menthat have appeared on the screen to date. They're just like anyother guys their age, except that their romantic interests arefocused on  guys rather than girls.  Had this film been made tenyears earlier, Griff would almost certainly have been portrayed as a nerdy, unlikable, social outcast; but Griff is every frat boy's bestfriend.  Two thumbs up for this one.</p>
