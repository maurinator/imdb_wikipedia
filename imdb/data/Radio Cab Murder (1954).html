<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Radio Cab Murder" begins with an armed robbery. A cab driver, Fred Martin, sees the getaway and gives chase and almost catches up to them...almost. The police were thankful Martin tried and are impressed because Martin is an ex-con--and he's really turned his life around since his release. And, among his co-workers, he's very popular. However, someone is trying to get Martin fired--and sent an anonymous letter to his employer--telling him that Martin in an ex-con. However, the boss likes Martin also and already knows he's an ex-con. No problem, right? Well the police soon realize that the letter might not have come from some crank but a local gang. That's because their safe-cracker was found dead (of natural causes, apparently)--and Martin used to break open safes. It seems that they are TRYING to get him fired so that he'll need work--and they'll offer him some quick money doing SOMETHING illegal. But what is it? Well, the only way to find out is if Martin is willing to work for the police--which he does. But this gang is very deadly and very cautious and it sure looks as if Fred is in for trouble.This is a very low budget British film. I didn't recognize anyone in the film. Yet, despite this, the film was reasonably exciting and well done. In particular, it ended very well when Martin's friends back at the cab company learn he's in danger and come pouring out of the woodwork to find him! While not a great film by any stretch, it is entertaining and worth a look.If you are interested in seeing it, it's available from Alpha Video. The print is surprisingly good considering the source.</p>
