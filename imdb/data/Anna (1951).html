<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Finally found a vhs copy of Anna(1951) via Movie Classics...Bad copy chopped..sniped together but the essence of this sultry exciting Italian neo classic film is still there...Over 50 yrs since I first saw this film in the Regent Theatre in Newark,NJ  with my family..but those images remain...Anna the Nun.,Anna the nurse, Anna the night club samba singer dancer, Anna the whore who loves one man & sensually lusts after another!!!!The songs "Anna" sung by Mangano(#1 Hit record) & also "Non Dimenticar" are unforgettable.. beautiful Mangano, the  face of Italy has made some US films notably, Ulysseus,5 Branded Women, & The Tempest, but will be remembered by aging  audiences as the supreme siren of neo classic Italian films, Bitter Rice,ANNA, & Gold of Naples  etc...dont miss..& lets hope we get a better copy!!!</p>
