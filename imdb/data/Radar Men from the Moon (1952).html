<h1>Radar Men from the Moon (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Strategic targets on Earth are being destroyed by an unknown weapon. Government security head Henderson suspects it's an "atomic ray" originating from the moon! He assigns Commando Cody, scientist and man of action with a secret flying suit, to investigate. Soon, Cody is battling Earth thugs in the pay of Krog the moon man and making trips in his experimental rocket to the moon itself, in a perilous and all but singlehanded effort to thwart the planned invasion of Earth.</p>
<p>Commando Cody, 'Sky Marshal of the Universe'(George Wallace), works with American scientists Joan Gilbert (Aline Towne) and Ted Richards (William Bakewell) in the development of a flying suit and a rocket to the Moon. When the nation's defenses are being sabotaged and destroyed, Cody learns that an atomic-gun is being used and that the men on the moon are the culprits. Cody, Joan and Ted take off in a rocket to the moon and, upon arrival, Cody is captured by moon-henchmen, working for Retik (Roy Barcroft), who seeks to capture and rule the earth. But, at the end of chapter one, Cody appears to be in no position to keep Retik from achieving his goal.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Moon ruler Retik assigned one of his people to go on Earth and cripple its defenses to a point when the Moon people could go down and invade it. The defense department gets a hold of the idea, and assigns Commando Cody, with flying rocket suit and all. Cody, along with his assistants, journey to the moon, are nearly killed and go back down upon Earth to stop the sabotage in progress in order to force Retik to come down and strike himself. The only Republic serial that did a good job trying to parody the 50's science craze, is at times ridiculous but still a lot of fun to watch. Sort-of sequel to King of the Rocketman and later inspired a kiddie TV show. Clayton Moore ( the Lone Ranger himself ) plays one of the Moon Men's hired guns. Just a little above average serial at best. I never saw the MST3K version, but they would have had a lot more fun doing Zombies of the Stratosphere or Flying Discman from Mars. Rating based on serials- 6 out of 10.</p>
