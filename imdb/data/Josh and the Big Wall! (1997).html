<h1>Josh and the Big Wall! (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Israelites are trying to get to the promised land, but first they must pass through Jericho, which is guarded by...the French Peas. Also, some of Joshua's charges have their own ideas on how to get past the walled city. Will Joshua listen to God's directions, or will he try to do things his way?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love the Veggie Tales videos, as do my two toddlers. However, this one video has a major stumbling block for me. I can allow for the fact that the characters are vegetables and that they soften the violence of the original Bible story for young ears. I do not, however, like the fact that the whole story is based on the Israelites not 'following God's directions' when, in this instance, they *did.* They followed his directions to the letter. There are so many other instances in Scripture where the Israelites disobeyed. There was plenty of material out there on which to base a story with this lesson. To imply disobedience here when they obeyed seems slanderous.Beyond that, the video is great. Some of the people at Big Idea Productions are obvious Monty Python fans. I just gotta love that! However, I've decided to avoid purchasing the VT videos based specifically on Bible stories (as opposed to morality tales) as history is not something I like to see messed with.</p>
