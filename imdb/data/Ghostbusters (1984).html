<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Egon work at the University where they delve into the paranormal and fiddle with many unethical experiments on the students. As they are kicked out of the University do they really understand their knowledge of the paranormal and go into business for themselves. Under the new snazzy business name of 'Ghostbusters', and living in the old firehouse building they work out of, they are called to rid New York City of paranormal phenomenon at everyone's whim.... for a price. They make national press as the media thinks and pressures everybody the Ghostbusters are the cause of it all. Thrown in jail by the EPA, the mayor takes a chance and calls on them to help save the city. Unbeknownst to all, a long dead Gozer worshiper (Evo Shandor) erected downtown apartment building is the cause of all the paranormal activity. They find out the building could resurrect the ancient Hittite god, Gozer, and bring an end to all of humanity. Who are you gonna call to stop this terrible world-ending menace?</p>
<p>Three odd-ball scientists get kicked out of their cushy positions at a university in New York City where they studied the occult. They decide to set up shop in an old firehouse and become Ghostbusters, trapping pesky ghosts, spirits, haunts, and poltergeists for money. They wise-crack their way through the city, and stumble upon a gateway to another dimension, one which will release untold evil upon the city. The Ghostbusters are called on to save the Big Apple.</p>
<p>Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler are three scientists at Columbia University in New York City. When their grant expires, the guys are fired and they go into business as a ghost extermination company called "Ghostbusters". Their first customer is orchestra cello player Dana Barrett, who was scared out of her apartment on the 22nd floor of a high rise apartment building on Central Park West. It seems that Dana's neighbor, Louis Tully, is also being affected by the strange happenings in the apartment building. Armed with proton guns, the Ghostbusters become wildly popular, and they are joined by Winston Zeddmore, who is looking for a job with good pay. Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Peck is forced to believe the Ghostbusters when New York City is put under siege by an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer the Gozerian, who is channeled through the apartment building that Dana and Louis live in, and the mayor has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters out of jail to face Gozer.</p>
<p>After being kicked out of their university, parapsychology professors Spengler, Stantz and Venkman decide to go into business for themselves by trapping and removing ghosts from haunted houses. After some initial skepticism, business is soon booming as The Ghost Busters rid New York of its undead. When a downtown skyscraper becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient god Gozer, however, the problem may be more than the team can handle.</p>
<p>Three former parapsychology professors set up shop as a unique ghost removal service.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ghostbusters was an incredibly huge smash hit on its original release back in `84  and its not hard to see why - its a  funny , exciting  and imaginative  thrill ride. There is a lot to like about  ghostbusters , like bill Murrays  constant and always funny wise cracks,  the films constant shift  from a light hearted comedy to  intense ghost busting thriller and of course , the technically flawless attack of the marsh mallow man  that is probably one of my favorite parts of this film.In this day and age of computer generated  fx wizardry   the completely analogue special effects  still look  great ( especially the stay puft marsh mallow man , its rampage through the city   looks incredibly   real ! ) and the film it self is still better and more imaginative  than  a lot of event movies you will find in a cinema near you  today .And to top it all off  Ghostbusters is one of the few films out there that actually  had  worthy TV spin off that was the "real Ghostbusters", a cartoon that  i loved as a kid.Ghostbusters is a film that truly deserves its iconic status.The screen dwellers mark (out of 5 ) : * * * *</p>
