<h1>The Lieutenant Wore Skirts (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this hilarious romp starring Tom Ewell, Sheree North and Rita Moreno, a middle-aged ex-serviceman who plans to re-enlist (Ewell) is shocked to learn that not only did he fail his medical exam, his wife (North) has enlisted - and is really making the grade in the Air Force. Unhappy to be a "house husband," he flies to Hawaii to be near her - and also to hatch a scheme to get her discharged.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Long overshadowed by director Frank Tashlin's The Girl Can't Help It (also 1956), The Lieutenant Wore Skirts is deserving of reappraisal. Starring hatchet faced Tom Ewell as Greg Whitcomb, a U.S. Air Force reservist with a bad knee and a wife (Sheree North) in the service, it's a thoroughly sexist but hilarious film. When North is ordered to serve in Hawaii, Ewell follows after her, determined to get her to quit or be discharged by hook or by crook. Forced to stay home cleaning dishes, cooking dinner, and playing bridge with the girls, he soon cooks up a plot to convince base psychiatrist Edward Platt that his wife is suffering from a nervous breakdown. Shot in brilliant Technicolor and in Cinemascope, this is 50s cinema eye candy par excellence, but the film also benefits from a snappy (and at times, quite daring) Tashlin screenplay. Besides the always wonderful Ewell, the film also features an hilarious performance by Rita Moreno as an air-headed beauty who gives him ideas.</p>
