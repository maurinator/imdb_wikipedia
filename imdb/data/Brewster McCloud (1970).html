<h1>Brewster McCloud (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brewster is an owlish, intellectual boy who lives in a fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome. He has a dream: to take flight within the confines of the stadium. Brewster tells those he trusts of his dream, but displays a unique way of treating others who do not fit within his plans. When the fateful day arrives, and he enters the dome with his fanciful construction of bird wings, Brewster is surrounded by the police. Will he be caught before he attempts to fly?</p>
<p>An introverted loner living in the bowels of the Astrodome plots to develop - with the aid of a mysterious guardian angel - a pair of wings that will help him fly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brewster Mccloud is one of Altman's lesser known films unfortunately. It was released the same year as Mash, with many cast members from that film. It stars Bud Cort as Brewster Mccloud. A quiet, withdrawn boy who lives below the Houston Astrodome in a fallout shelter . Brewster is constructing wings because he perceives himself to be a bird and wants to escape the mundanity and futility of human existence.  His only link with society is a mysterious woman named Louise (played by Sally Kellerman)clad in a raincoat with an unusual bird perched on her shoulder. A murder subplot involves a series of bizarre deaths, with the victims found covered in bird excrement. Michael Murphy stars as Frank Shaft, an iconoclastic cop from San Francisco who is called in to investigate. Wearing blue contact lenses ( in an obvious parody of Steve Mcqueen's Bulitt). As the story progresses Brewster gets into many misadventures and falls for the tour guide at the Astrodome ( a young Shelly Duvall in her film debut). which is his eventual undoing. Brewster Mccloud is a very dark comedy and not for all tastes. Altman perfectly satirizes the emptiness of middle class values and the absurdity of human priorities and our futile attempt to break away in this clever parable. The cast is uniformly excellent as we would expect from any Altman film. Stacy Keach is hilarious in a scene stealing role at the begining. Also Altman's typical unconventional narrative style with Rene Auberjonois ( as the "Lecturer")who is juxtaposed in many scenes discussing the various aspects of birds and serving as the narrator. Not to be missed.</p>
