<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An insurance investigator romances a wealthy young beauty when he suspects she may be involved in fencing stolen jewels.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dr. Bombay is wrong about this film being made for TV.It was always intended to be a feature, produced by the General Electric subsidiary, Tomorrow Entertainment. It suffered along the way from problems with the script and was delayed several times.Alan Trustman, a lawyer and the author of the film, remained mostly in Boston during development, which hindered the process of fixing the script. While Tomorrow Entertainment did indeed produce many fine TV movies, Lady Ice was one of two features developed by the company. The other was Gravy Train, a bit of cult classic. After the limited success of these films the company concentrated on TV movies.</p>
