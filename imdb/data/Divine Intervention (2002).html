<h1>Divine Intervention (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Santa Claus tries to outrun a gang of knife-wielding youth. It's one of several vignettes of Palestinian life in Israel - in a neighborhood in Nazareth and at Al-Ram checkpoint in East Jerusalem. Most of the stories are droll, some absurd, one is mythic and fanciful; few words are spoken. A man who goes through his mail methodically each morning has a heart attack. His son visits him in hospital. The son regularly meets a woman at Al-Ram; they sit in a car, hands caressing. Once, she defies Israeli guards at the checkpoint; later, Ninja-like, she takes on soldiers at a target range. A red balloon floats free overhead. Neighbors toss garbage over walls. Life goes on until it doesn't.</p>
<p>Separated by a checkpoint, Palestinian lovers from Jerusalem and Ramallah arrange clandestine meetings.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like others who have commented on this film, I, too, cannot stop thinking about it...  thinking about how I was lured to the theater by a very good trailer that was crafted, I'm sure, to appeal to my interest in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, my concerns with world affairs and other cultures. I was used!From beginning to end, a chain of weak metaphors... Nothing Divine - no intervention. Pure tedium.Best metaphor? At the very end, a pressure cooker - and the old lady saying "Turn it off."I can't remember being this disappointed - ever - in a movie that I was so excited about seeing. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry ... Perhaps I should though; for the potential of all that this subject should have inspired in a truly creative and thoughtful writer/director.  For shame.</p>
