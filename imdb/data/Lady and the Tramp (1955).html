<h1>Lady and the Tramp (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lady, a golden cocker spaniel, meets up with a mongrel dog who calls himself the Tramp. He is obviously from the wrong side of town, but happenings at Lady's home make her decide to travel with him for a while. This turns out to be a bad move, as no dog is above the law.</p>
<p>Lady is a pampered Cocker Spaniel who lives in the ritzy part of town. Everything is great until Jim Dear and Darling, Lady's owners have a baby. Then Aunt Sarah and her two scheming Siamese cats come to stay. Lady is thought to be vicious and is muzzled and put outside. Tramp comes to her rescue. Lady runs away with him only to be caught by the dogcatcher.</p>
<p>Jim "Dear" and "Darling" have had Lady, their pedigree cocker spaniel, since she was a puppy. Using her charms on them, Lady has been a pampered part of their upper class life, which all three consider perfect and complete. Lady's life takes a bit of a turn with the imminent addition of a baby into the household. Lady doesn't really know what a baby is or means, but gets a lesson in such from her two neighborhood friends, Jock, a proper Scottish terrier, and Trusty, a hound who doesn't realize that he may have lost his sense of smell. The baby's arrival indirectly has an effect on Lady's perfect life, most specifically when Aunt Sarah, with her two mischievous Siamese cats, comes to babysit. To escape this negative turn in her life, Lady eventually turns to Tramp, a mongrel she once met. Tramp lives a carefree life on the "wrong side of the tracks", and is renowned within his circle as being one of the most resourceful dogs, who is able to escape capture from the dog catcher as being unlicensed. He is also known as a womanizer. As Lady and Tramp fall for each other, the question becomes whether their two divergent lifestyles can mesh together, and if so what form that will take.</p>
<p>The romantic tale of a sheltered uptown Cocker Spaniel dog and a streetwise downtown Mutt.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is nothing as wonderful as the wag of a dog's tale.  The writers, actors and animators, together with Disney magic, capture the unique and limitless variety of personalities that exist in the canine world.   This film takes these wonderful canine characters and shows the world from their perspective. The adorable footage of Lady as a puppy reminds me of the behavior of my own hounds when they were pups.    The beautiful "Park Avenue" Lady grows up and falls for the happy-go-lucky, vagabond, Tramp. Add a dog-hating aunt, a baby, some cats, some rats and the adventure is complete.  The songs sung from the dog pound together with those sung by the wicked Siamese cats are the most purely fun of any Disney animation. The song sung at the lover's romantic Italian dinner brings a tear to the eye. Finally, Lady and the Tramp share a spaghetti noodle that leads to one of the most memorable kisses in Hollywood history.  This is a wonderful film that will be enjoyed for generations.</p>
