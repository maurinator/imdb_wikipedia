<h1>Guns at Batasi (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Regimental Sergeant-Major Lauderdale is a spit-and-polish, by-the-book disciplinarian, who seems like a 19th Century anachronism in a sleepy peacetime African outpost of the modern British Commonwealth. He is ridiculed behind his back by his subordinate NCO's and must play host to a liberal female MP making a tour of the base. However, when an ambitious African officer, who happens to be a protege of the MP's, initiates a coup d'etat against Captain Abraham, the lawful African commandant, the resourceful RSM uses all his military training to arm his men despite being under house arrest and rescue the wounded commandant from a certain firing squad. When Lt. Boniface, the leader of the mutiny surrounds the sergeants mess with two Bofors guns, it looks like Lauderdale will have to surrender unless he again disobeys orders and takes the initiative.</p>
<p>An anachronistic martinet RSM on a remote Colonial African army caught in a local coup d'etat must use his experience to defend those in his care.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I enjoyed this black and white low budget film. Although it was about the British army in East Africa during a coup, it was not an action film in the Rambo or Jean Claude Van Damm vein, instead it was an intelligent portrayal of a career RSM faced with a crisis on his hands, and having to take the appropriate action to save the people for whom he was responsible. In many ways the film reminded me of Tunes of Glory, where Alec Guiness played a similar career NCO.The film is proof that a low budget B&W production filmed in a studio need not be an inferior product. Tens of millions of dollars do not need to be squandered on action scenes, all you need is a darned good script, good actors and imagination.</p>
