<h1>The Savage Innocents (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Eskimo who has had little contact with white men goes to a trading post where he accidentally kills a missionary and finds himself being pursued by the police.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very powerful and moving study of the decisions faced by law enforcement when there is clearly a situation not forseen by lawmakers and how a police officer might conclude that the "right" thing to do is not always to follow proper procedure. To me, one of the most moving  scenes in the movie is the final scene in which the wife's mother appears. Also, the scene where Anthony Quinn has his chance to escape is a very revealing instance of character. I would very much like to see this movie available on video or DVD.</p>
