<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like another reviewer, I saw this haunting, moving film decades ago and have been wanting to see it again ever since. It deals with complex, yet very human questions of love, trust, loyalty, and betrayal under unexpected, trying circumstances. I remember it as being superbly acted and the relationship between the two main characters intimately explored and developed. The ending was heart-wrenching. I am about to go to Transylvania and Budapest, but doubt I could find it there in VHS format, subtitled in English. Does anyone know if it has been subtitled in either Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, or French (which I also read)?</p>
