<p>A celebrated painter receives a visit from a cardinal's assistant, who informs him that his mother could become a saint.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A terrific film from Italy; thoroly true to Italian (mostly Roman Catholic) family values. (I was born and raised in one such Italian family, but here in the land of "Merda de cane," (Americano(s), as some Italians call us.)The music is quite interesting, too. The unmistakable music and voice of Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard forms a great part of the atmosphere of the funeral scene. She even appears (singing) on camera for a bit. Why she is not acknowledged, I cannot imagine. No entry in the credits roll. And none in the IMDb profiles - personal or film, either.Might the have been some unpleasantry among producers, director, cast, crew, etc? She's credited appropriately in Hans Zimmer's part in the music of Gladiator, The Insider, Man On Fire, and Heat, for instance.Any ideas, folx?</p>
