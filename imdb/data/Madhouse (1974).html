<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Horror movie actor Paul Toombes, famous for playing "Dr. Death," suffers a nervous breakdown before going to England to do a TV series. Cast and crew members start dying the way characters did in Toombes' old movies.</p>
<p>Paul Toombes made himself a Hollywood star by playing the role of Dr. Death in a series of successful horror films written by his friend, Herbert Flay. But now, after years in a mental institution following the murder of his fianc√©e, Ellen - a murder that many, and even he himself, believe he committed - he wants nothing to do with the homicidal character. Herbert, who is writing a new TV series about Dr. Death, persuades him to return to the role. Paul soon regrets the decision when the producer of the series turns out to be the former maker of porn movies in which Ellen starred. Worse, his new female lead is arrogant and incompetent. Meanwhile, he discovers that he is not the only guest in Herbert's home. There's also Faye, his former co-star, who has gone mad after being deformed in a car explosion. But none of this unpleasantness compares to the horror of Dr. Death himself. It seems the character has a will of his own - a will to commit murder.</p>
<p>A horror movie star returns to his famous role after years in a mental institution. But the character seems to be committing murders independent of his will.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Following the grisly murder of his fiancee,Hollywood film star Paul Toombes(Vincent Price)withdraws into his own world.Some time later,he is persuaded by an old actor-friend(Peter Cushing)to revive his famous horror role as Doctor Death.Life soon becomes a living nightmare for Toombes when friends and colleagues are brutally murdered one by one."Madhouse" is a rather cheaply made horror film that manages to create only a little bit of suspense.The story,which is based on the novel 'Devilday' by Angus Hall is also not very intriguing.Director Jim Clark uses clips from old Roger Corman horror films featuring Vincent Price as reenactments of the murders.Still the film is slightly entertaining and it's nice to see two horror veterans Vincent Price and Peter Cushing together.Check it out.7 out of 10.</p>
