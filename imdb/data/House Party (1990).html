<h1>House Party (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young Kid has been invited to a party at his friend Play's house. But after a fight at school, Kid's father grounds him. None the less, Kid sneaks out when his father falls asleep. But Kid doesn't know that three of the thugs at school has decided to give him a lesson in behaviour...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>very funny, energetic film with a great dance sequence and a really funny song in the prison. Kid and Play are a  great double act and the writing is high quality. I saw a bit of this other Kid and Play film called Class Act and it wasn't half as good because all the jokes were predictable. You can't help but be cheered up by seeing House Party: the ancient, unused condom- how true.</p>
