<h1>The Incredible Journey (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of three pets, a cat and two dogs, who lose their owners when they are all on vacation. Can they find their way home?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>a great film - far better than all the modern animatronics stuff from disney and the like these days - can anyone clarify what exact breed of cat played the part? I don't think it was Siamese or Birman but very closely related.</p>
