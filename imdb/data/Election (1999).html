<h1>Election (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tracy Flick is running unopposed for this year's high school student election. But school civics teacher Jim McAllister has a different plan. Partly to establish a more democratic election, and partly to satisfy some deep personal anger toward Tracy, Jim talks popular varsity football player Paul Metzler to run for president as well. Chaos ensues.</p>
<p>Jim McAllister is a Social Studies teacher at Carver High. A student of his, Tracy Flick, tends to rub him the wrong way. Flick, a loner and ambitious girl, decides to run for class president. McAllister convinces football player Paul to run against her. His lesbian sister Tammy joins the election after her girlfriend starts going out with Paul. During the campaigns, Tracy plays dirty, plying students with muffins and gum. Tammy adopts an anarchist attitude that the student body responds to. Paul has few skills to offer the position. Meanwhile, McAllister's going through a bad time with his wife.</p>
<p>Tracy Flick is the most driven student at Carver High, who just happens to be having an affair with one of her teachers. Another teacher--Mr. McAllister--is having an affair with his wife's best friend. Student Elections are under way, when Mr. McAllister persuades football jock Paul to run against Flick for his own pleasure. Flick, of course, is mortified that Paul is even trying to compete. Tammy, Paul's lesbian sister who got dumped by her girlfriend to go with Paul, decides that running against her brother is the best revenge. Who will win the election this year?</p>
<p>A high school teacher's personal life becomes complicated as he works with students during the school elections, particularly with an obsessive overachiever determined to become student body president.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know how many people who saw ELECTION saw Alexander Payne's previous film, CITIZEN RUTH(1996).  That film was a satire on abortion, with Laura Dern as a pregnant homeless woman with several children already taken away by social services, and who is caught in a tug-of-war between pro-choice and pro-life activists.  I've never seen an abortion satire before, so that was fresh, but all the characters where instead caricatures, so it was difficult for me to laugh.  And the points were made with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer swatting a fly.ELECTION suffers somewhat from that problem, but most of it works.  Much of that, of course, is due to Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.  Both of them embody their characters down to a T, and while they show us their flaws and their laughable parts, they also made them human beings.  As much as we're meant to dislike Tracy, for example, I actually felt sorry for her when she talked about being lonely.  And how events proceed between them is logical and well-told.Less well-done is Chris Klein as the jock who runs against Tracy.  He's likeable at times, but I could see Klein condescend to him and make him a boob at times(as his sister Tammy, on the other hand, Jessica Campbell makes a good impression; I was actually surprised at an action she took, though it does make sense).  I also thought the sexual repression stuff was obvious and overdone, especially when Broderick sees and hears Tracy when he's making love.  We got that already.  Nevertheless, this is often funny and biting.</p>
