<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was fortunate to have seen the English version, with subtitles,"Memoirs of a River." The plot of this beautiful, haunting work is based upon an actual incident in 1880 and takes place within the Austro-Hungarian Empire near the Carpatho-Russian region. The story is interesting but the art of the movie expresses, through film as well as melodies the simple, but profound spirituality of a people and time that are no more. This rare piece of cinema is an example of the fragility and the rare peaks   of European cinema unknown to most people; this profound movie evokes spiritual sensibilities reminiscent of Werner Herzog's latest and greatest masterpiece,"Invincible" or the 1972 Russian classic,"Solaris."</p>
