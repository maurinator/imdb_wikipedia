<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Jet Pilot" is one of John Wayne's best and most unusual efforts. In it he is very natural and convincing, quite unlike his typically more stylized and sometimes wooden approach to roles. And his interesting interpretation of an Air Force colonel tempted by a seductive Russian spy is a real departure from his usual gung-ho offering. When US authorities are going to deport the defecting Russian pilot for espionage, he risks losing his military career by marrying her, and when it appears that she will get a long prison sentence, he not only helps her escape to the USSR, but by all appearances, must defect, himself. Say what? John Wayne selling out his country for the love of a woman? Needless to say, this is not his usual on screen behavior. The result is a compelling story and a very romantic movie, with Wayne and Janet Leigh rocketing through the skies in their twin jets or discussing sex and politics. These two make a very convincing young couple and the sexual chemistry and tension run high. Not only is Wayne at the top of his game, but Janet Leigh is particularly appealing as the shapely Russian pilot. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which he must search her. It is sad that Janet Leigh is remembered only for the shower scene in "Psycho." She ought to be remembered, instead, for the strip search in "Jet Pilot."</p>
