<h1>The Revengers (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The life of peaceful rancher John Benedict (William Holden) is torn apart when his family is massacred by a gang of marauding outlaws and his farm is destroyed. He assembles a team of mean, lawless convicts to act as his posse as he pursues the gang responsible for the deaths of his loved ones.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At first glance this would seem to be just another violent western of the same class as "The Wild Bunch".  Look more deeply into the characters and you will find several interesting changes over the course of the movie. Each character shows a human and sometimes frail side that belies the hard person that they have become.</p>
