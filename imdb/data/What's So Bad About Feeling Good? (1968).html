<h1>What's So Bad About Feeling Good? (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A new infection that simply makes people feel happy is treated as a threat by the authorities while its "victims" work to spread it to others.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a movie that should definitely be brought out on video, or played on television, or somehow brought into availability now.  It is such a great commentary for our time, and probably more significant now than it was when it came out.  I haven't seen it since 1968, and yet I still remember the lessons I learned from it.  With all of the drugs and medications that are used to make people feel "good" and "happy", maybe we need to be reminded that if it's real, it comes from the inside.  It is a silly movie, and certainly a dated one (beatniks?), but a young George Peppard is worth seeing in this one.</p>
