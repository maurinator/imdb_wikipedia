<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>White Fang 2Already the beginning causes you to grip your chair and gape as the movie pummels into an adventure. With lots of action and bits of humor this movie's great for the whole family. An intense conflict rumbles between the Indians and an enigmatic priest, who, unknown until the end for his true purpose, cons as a friend.  How are the Indian's going to find their caribou? Who better to stop gold miners than their own kind? Henry Casey, Lilly, White Fang, and Peter must put their courage to the test and save their people, the Inuit tribe from starvation and loss of their homeland! A thrilling sensation to watch, appropriate for all ages, and emotionally intense, this movie has all the elements of a magnificent movie. Your head swims in despair as you watch Lili, daughter of Moses, resolve her emotional conflicts with Henry. You feel like shouting out, when you see Moses, the leader of the Inuit Tribe, smile with satisfaction.  See this movie right away!</p>
