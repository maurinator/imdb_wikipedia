<h1>Crooklyn (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>From Spike Lee comes this vibrant semi-autobiographical portrait of a school-teacher, her stubborn jazz-musician husband and their five kids living in '70s Brooklyn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I always had a thing for this movie; it's just all-aroundentertaining and fun and hilarious, then heartrendingly sad...all of that in this cooler-than-cool atmosphere of '75 Brooklyn.Any movie that will make you laugh and cry as hard this one is a perfect film experience to me.It is at times uneven and glaringly annoying, but that's easily overrided by so many great qualities like those kids and the acting by everyone. I'm seventeen but I wish I lived in 1975 Brooklyn 'cuz it looked like the richness of life!</p>
