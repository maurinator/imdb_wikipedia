<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with most of the positive comments on this film. I also waited ages to see this. My wife was an extra in one of the mall parking lot scenes and I was with her on the shoot (She was also in Less than Zero, ah those were the days). I never bought the video as I was waiting for a widescreen version which never came out. Then I happened to catch in on MGM HD on directTV recently. It surely has stood the test of time. It's like a well stored vintage wine, more tasty for having been locked away. Sheen as a Dean-like forerunner of his over the top real life and TV sitcom persona, is excellent. Sweeney is like Duchovny, brilliant in his understatedness. Even the listless sister adds to the increasing and uneasy chemistry that develops between the 3. I bought it.Needless to say, the action is tight and gripping. I've cruised Mulholland in a Porsche, and take out of town relatives there to sightsee so I may be biased, heheh... The HD transfer was luminous and film-like perfection. A plus was the 80's soundtrack featuring a live appearance by The Untouchables, an early Ska local band! What more can I say? Yes the movie does has Law and Order written all over it,but ah, what a episode! If you enjoy the slower paced movies of the golden era, this one won't disappoint.</p>
