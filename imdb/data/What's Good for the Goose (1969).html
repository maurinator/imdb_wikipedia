<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you can get over the shock of seeing Norman Wisdom playing someone other than Pitkin without the ill fitting suit and cap, then it's not as bad as you'd expect. The speeded up title sequence was a nice idea but unfortunately it goes on far too long and outstays it's welcome. Confusingly there's a credit attributing the singing of the theme to Norman himself, but that version is at the end of the film.Simply, Norman plays a somewhat timid banker who has a fairly hum drum life, married with children. He ends up having to go to the executive conference held at a seaside resort. On the way he picks up two teenage girl hitchhikers who end up opening his eyes to the fun filled world of the late 1960's. There's visual appeal in the shape of Sally Geeson (sister of Judy) who once said the most embarrassing thing she ever did was the nude scene on the beach in this film.For the genre, a lightweight swinging sixties comedy it's enjoyable. Features "The Pretty Things" in a psychedelic club scene. Groovy Man!</p>
