<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>hyderabad blues is such a simple yet brilliantly todl film. every scene is well made and clearly thoguth through. shot on a shoe-string budget this movie captures brilliantly the traditional vs. the modern india.hyderabad blues is about an NRI (Non-Resident Indian) who returns home and his parents set out to get him married. how he falls in love and what happens eventually is the basis of the plot.the scenes are quite hilarious although the ending is a bit disappointing. this movie was one of the biggests surprises when it was released, doing much better than the lavish bollywood movies. this multi-lingual film hit the right chords among the audience, since almost very urban indian knows or is related to somebody who has been to the U.S of A ... the American return confused Indian is a well understood concept.the movie in all is a triumph for good storytelling over expensive production values. a terrific watcha hilarious 9!</p>
