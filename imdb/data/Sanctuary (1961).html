<h1>Sanctuary (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>William Faulkner's Deep South drama of tragedy and expose of a "proper" community riddled with moral decay to the household of a governor of Mississippi during the 1920's. The governor's cherished and properly married daughter makes an astonishing confession to the governor just before the execution of a household servant for the murder of the daughter's baby.</p>
<p>William Faulkner's steamy tale set in the South in the 1920s. Governer's daughter is seduces and raped by a Cagin who returns after she's married to cause her further trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Basic Southern Soaper. Bradford Dillman was not believable as romantic lead. Yves Montand came off like Herbert Lom in the movie with the talking ape that Jimmie "J.J." Walker and Dom De Luise made in the late 1980's. The only reason to see this one is if you are a Lee Remick fan and want to see her in period lingerie.</p>
