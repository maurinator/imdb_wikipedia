<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie evokes some mixed feelings in me... it is carried by the two female actresses in main roles, and that storyline (pretty much the only one anyway) should have been followed to the end. The mermaid is superbly played by Rya Kihlstedt, in difficult circumstances (topless, mostly in water, with no dialogue). She is beautiful, exotic, sexy, vulnerable and deadly - what more could one ask for?It is a real shame that the end is a cheap ripoff of the "Alien" movies totally unnecessary and pretty much ruins the movie. It is amazing that this movie couldn't get financing outside of ridiculous "Creature feature" serial... With proper budget and improved scenario this had the potential to be a hit, probably instant classic of the genre (you can quote me on that).I am giving this a 6 overall: Rya Kihlstedt - an easy 10 Rufus Sewell & Carla Gugino - around 7 each, Gugino had more screen time but wasn't really that good the script & directing - overall 6, but the end ruins it down to 3</p>
