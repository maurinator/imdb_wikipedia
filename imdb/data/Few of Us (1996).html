<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Silent Lithuanian film about a woman visiting a Fayre.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bartas is not what I'd call a versatile filmmaker. His films are always slow, desolate, brooding and static. However, by hammering this aesthetic again and again he's managed to carve out a very idiosyncratic niche, making him a master in the overwrought art-house circle. Few of Us is Bartas at his very best.Though the film lacks the outside political context which haunt Praejusios dienos atminimui and Koridorius, it is a deeply personal and emotional work. The setting becomes the main character, with the actors simply supporting it as they hustle and bustle through the pastoral landscape. Actions are carried out by the characters but nothing is explained. We are completely oblivious to their motivations or context. Yekaterina Golubeva's character is dropped into the setting via helicopter but we spend the whole film struggling to interpret why she is there. It provides many questions but few too answers, which only serves to enhance the mysteriousness of the film's purpose. The ambiguity of the characters doesn't hinder the film's emotional resonance however, demonstrating just how universal loneliness really is. Though the word 'thought-provoking' is overused in regards to these types of films, it really is the only word that can be used.</p>
