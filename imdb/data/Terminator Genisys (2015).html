<p>The continuing saga of humanity's war with the machines who are led by Skynet the artificial intelligence that decided that humanity needs to be eradicated. John Connor, the one leading the human rebels against Skynet, has a plan to attack Skynet but decides not to take part in it and opts instead to prevent Skynet from implementing it's contingency plan--to send a terminator to kill the woman who would give birth to John, Sarah Connor. But he fails so he sends his right hand, Kyle Reese who is the one who will sire him, to protect Sarah. And as Reese is leaving he sees John attacked by someone there who is one of Skynet's soldiers. When Reese arrives, he discovers a terminator which is not like the ones he's encountered. He is saved by Sarah who knows who he is and why he is there. He also discovers she has a terminator with her. She tells him that the terminator he encountered was sent to kill her when she was nine and the terminator, with her, was sent to save her and has been her companion and guardian ever since. They intercepted the terminator he followed and plan to use it's chip to activate a time machine they built to go to 1997 which is when Skynet was activated but Reese says they should not go to 1997 but to 2017. He says that there's a voice or memory that tells him to remember the date because it's when they can stop Skynet. So Sarah and Reese go, the terminator stays behind and says he'll meet them when they arrive but they get arrested when they arrive and someone unexpected show up.</p>
<p>When John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect Sarah Connor and become the father of John, nothing is the same as it was set to be. One of the things that is different is that Sarah has her very own terminator who acts like father to her.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect Sarah Connor, but when he arrives back in 1984, nothing is as he expected it to be.The original Terminator's horror aspects and Terminator 2: Judgement Day's big blockbuster feel make them two very important films in redefining the action genre and T2 was the film to showcase to us what brilliance can be done using special effects. The other entries in the series never really felt necessary and they never equaled the perfection of the first two.Terminator Genisys has its positives, in the first 20 minutes we our given a broader view of the apocalyptic 2029 and the resistance's struggle against the machines and I enjoyed that. Also Matt Smith's character reveal is great and although he has only got a few scenes he is perfect for his role. Older Arnold Schwarzenegger has still got it and he is great in his classic role with a slight twist.However, when Kyle Reese is sent back in time the movie falls apart and becomes a convoluted mess that simply does not work as its own story. One of the biggest problems I had with Terminator Genisys was that it never really tried to tell its own story it only exists off the success of the first two films, the continuous nods to T1 and 2 become extremely annoying and unwarranted. It lacks direction and every action sequence has been done to death at this stage. Jai Courtney lacks the gritty edge or charisma that Michael biehn had in the role of "Kyle Rice". Emilia Clarke is badly miscast in the role of "Sarah Connor" and she try's her best Linda Hamilton impression but lacks the strength and venerability Hamilton brought to the role. The romance between "Kyle Reese" and "Sarah Connor" just doesn't work, mainly because there is a lack of chemistry between the leads. J.K Simmons is wasted as a forgettable side character. The dialogue is poorly written and Jason Clarke's "John Connor" falls victim to this, even though he has some good scenes, the film also fails to resolve many story arcs possibly as a hope to spark viewers interests for future films. Honestly, this film should never have happened and it relies far to heavily on the first two James Cameron films. It is not a terrible film but it is a mediocre one and audiences have got to expect more. Originality is loosing out to this sort of meaningless, unnecessary reboot.Overall, Terminator Genisys turns into yet another forgettable reboot that offers nothing new and I am going to give it a 5/10.</p>
