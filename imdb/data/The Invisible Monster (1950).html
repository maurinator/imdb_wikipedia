<p>Evil villain plots to take over the world using an army of invisible soldiers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you haven't seen many serials, this would be a good start.  If you're a serial veteran, you'll recognize almost all of the cliffhanger endings, which have been lifted from other Republic serials.  Richard Webb, later TV's Captain Midnight, delivers a stiff performance and a lot of punches: at least one set per chapter is demolished in a slugfest.  John Hamilton, TV's Perry White in Superman, has a small part in the first and final chapter. For plot, there's even less logic than usual: bad guy wants to take over world with an army of invisible soldiers, but can barely manage to keep himself invisible.  Overall, below average.</p>
