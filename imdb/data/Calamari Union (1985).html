<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Calamari Union" (1985) is a deadpan comic neo-noir, done in an absurd way that doesn't ever fully make sense but makes just enough sense that we have something to hold onto. It's a bit like Buster Keaton crossed with "Your Show of Shows" and "The Blues Brothers". It's also like an homage to certain aspects of American culture. The music track has a good deal of excellent black music coming from Billie Holiday, Chuck Berry, and John Lee Hooker that leavens the other music. The men attempting to travel to another part of the city mostly wear long overcoats and sun glasses that make them look like parodies of American movie detectives. Some carry on like Dan Aykroyd. The movie is crazy and violent, which with the black and white style of photography and the frustration of the men in accomplishing their goal is what makes this resonate as an oddball neo-noir. The writer-director has adopted noir as a frame for the comedy and then let himself go without much regard for sensible continuity or plot. The actors look at times as if they were enjoying this nutty show and series of put-ons. It's not as funny as good old-fashioned comic genius or a slew of Jewish comedians of the 20th century, but then not that much modern comedy is as funny as those peaks in laughter generation. It's such dry humor that it mostly brings smiles rather than deep laughs. I appreciated its originality and the noir look of it, also the music score. It makes for very good diversion from run of the mill films or movies stuck in genre clich√©s.</p>
