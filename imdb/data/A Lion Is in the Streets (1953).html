Now Hank starts crusading against a crooked cotton buyer, and swiftly rises toward political power. Is there no stopping him?</p>
<p>A charismatic peddler from the bayous finds his true calling in politics. Is he a demagogue in the making?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The knock on this movie is that it isn't All The King's Men -- no this is a different movie, and Barbara Hale's character is much feistier than Anne Seymour's.  But, Cagney has the measure of his character and plays the role for everything it is worth.  The supporting cast does a good job in an overlooked and insightful slice of our American heritage.</p>
