<h1>Ram Aur Shyam (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Abused by an oppressive brother-in-law Gajendra (Pran), Ramchandra (Dilip Kumar) runs away from home, and ends up in a small village where he is mistaken for Shyamrao (also Dilip Kumar), and must accept Ganga (Leela Mishra) and his new name or face severe exorcism. Meanwhile, Shyamrao is mistaken for Ramchandra by Anjana (Waheeda Rehman) and her dad (Nazir Hussain). When Gajendra finds out, he is enraged and attempts to beat the stuffing out of the person he thinks is his brother-in-law, but Shyamrao refuses to be abused or beaten, and all of a sudden things start changing in the household as well as in the community. It is not long before Gajendra finds out about the truth, and plans an ugly death for Shyamrao, and all those opposed to him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, so, a movie about twins, and the main lead is none other than Mr Dilip Kumar. Ram Aur Shyam is a Dilip Kumar vehicle all the way and even the opening credits say "Dilip Kumar in his first dual role", as if it was an event of sorts. But while you expect something particular from the film, it turns out to be different. First, it is not a complete comedy of errors. Actually, there's more drama in this one than comedy. Towards the end, it even gets a dark tone which I personally did not predict and did not like at all. The comedy does work from time to time, and it's nice to see the turns even though everything is predictable. Ram Aur Shyam is not the only movie of its sort, and many such movies were made later, like Seeta Aur Geeta. Which brings me to the next point and it is the fact that today while watching all these twin movies, comparisons are inevitable. Clearly, the best one of the lot is Seeta Aur Geeta, an all-time great comedy, which had the verve, the light and lively comic mood, the music and the excellence that Ram Aur Shyam lacks. Even Hema Malini's unforgettable performance remains unmatched. Where acting goes, well, as said, this movie was made for Dilip Kumar, and he does well, but it is far from being his best. He is excellent as Shyam, but overdoes the cowardice and the shy nature of Ram. The girls do very well even if one expects to see them disappearing under his shadow. Waheeda Rehman plays Anjana with grace and conviction, while Mumtaz is wonderful as the street-smart Shanta. The supporting cast do well. The music is very ordinary and forgettable. Ram Aur Shyam is not a bad film and it has its moments of comedy and great fun, but they are limited, and I would rather go and watch Seeta Aur Geeta instead.</p>
