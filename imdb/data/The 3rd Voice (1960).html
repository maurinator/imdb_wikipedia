<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The 3rd Voice" is a worthwhile crime drama that is painstakingly laid out and seems longer than its 79 minutes. Much of its success is due to the efforts of old pro Edmond O'Brien, who is in virtually every scene. What saves this picture from a worse rating is the unique deus ex machina to wrap up the picture. I hadn't seen that one before, and the screenwriter gets high marks for resourcefulness and mental dexterity.This could also be called "The Phone Call Movie", as it contains more telephone conversations than I have ever seen in a full-length feature film. Just when it begins to seem as if some action will take place, the phone rings, killing the pace as the picture goes into a stall. My main objection to the film is the slow, deliberate pacing.As stated, O'Brien carries the film, aided by Laraine Day and Julie London. For younger film fans, Julie London was a 50's singer with a sultry voice and appearance to match. She never looked better than in "The 3rd Voice" - didn't know she could act and I didn't care.</p>
