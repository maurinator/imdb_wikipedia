<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Don't usually like Whoopie starrers, but she really does herself proud in this funny but sadly true account of discrimination against women in the business world (and others - academic, entertainment, etc.).  Amusing and clever film, but you have to be a working woman to really appreciate its truth and poetic justice.</p>
