<h1>They Might Be Giants (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>They Might be Giants chronicles the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in modern-day New York City. The fact that Sherlock Holmes is a psychotic paranoid and Dr. Watson is a female psychiatrist fascinated by his case is almost beside the point. Dr. Watson follows Holmes across Manhattan and is, against her better judgment, drawn into the master detective's world of intrigue and danger. This is a sweet, goofy and fairly romantic film that asks the questions "Whose reality is right...and does it really matter?"</p>
<p>In a Manhattan psychiatric hospital a man, convinced he is Sherlock Holmes, is treated by a female doctor who happens to be named Watson.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you look for flaws in this film you will find plenty.  Still, I gave this film a 10 vote because it has overriding qualities which are extremely rare. It is a magical film, full of poetry, it touches you where other films cannot reach.  It creates a fantasy world of its own in the midst of modern society, a fantasy world which is utterly implausible and yet so compellingly persuasive.The cast of this gem is mesmerisingly excellent, all parts I can think of are cast with character actors who on their own have stolen entire films from the stars.  The central performance by George C. Scott is majestic, and so is John Barry's wonderful score.  The film contains many memorable scenes, but outstanding amongst the lot is the supermarket scene.  If I had to compile a list of the ten best scenes ever put to celluloid, this would be included.Unique.</p>
