<h1>Last Summer (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During summer vacation on Fire Island, three young people--a girl and two guys--become so close that they form a sort-of threesome. When an uncool girl tries to infiltrate the trio's newly found relationship, they construct an elaborate plot that has violent results.</p>
<p>Late teens Sandy, Peter and Dan meet while their respective families vacation for the summer on Fire Island, New York. They instantly bond - initially over the rescue of an injured seagull - with the three entering into a friendship where they do everything together in solidarity with little respect for others, especially the adult figures in their life. They almost become indistinguishable as individuals when together, such as being in a gang. Things change when they meet another vacationing teen named Rhoda later in the summer. Rhoda is shy, seemingly insecure (which the three later learn for good reason), overly analytical and straight-laced, but she needs the acceptance of her peers. Then, the individual personalities of the three friends begins to emerge, Peter being the sensitive one, Dan the overly confident one who may not have reason to be, and Sandy the manipulative one, especially in using her sexuality to control the two males. But Rhoda, in asserting her own beliefs, may not have a chance when dealing with the three as a group.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the first teen-genre movies to show how cruel children can really be to one another.  The sound has been regarded as bad and grainy by some, but to me, it put me right there on the beach with them.  Stellar performances from the four young main characters, especially Richard Thomas and Catherine Burns (Supporting Actress nominee for this film).  Barbara Hershey changed her last name to Seagull because of the impact a certain scene had on her. Bruce Davison is great as the sex-crazed boy trying to lose his virginity. The anti-climactic ending of being confused teens, struggling to understand the life going on around them and what could possibly lie ahead is one of the best.  A chilling movie from 1969, this movie still holds up well and led the way for lesser imitations in the decades to come.  An all-time favorite of mine, but if you watch it, don't bother with the edited version -- you'll miss so much.</p>
