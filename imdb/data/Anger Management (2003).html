<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anger Management is probably the best example of 'good actors, bad movie' syndrome.  Some of the best in the biz were in this movie, and yet, somehow, it turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  One wonders how this movie ever made it out of the editing room.  How, throughout production, nobody looked up and said "god, what a crap movie we're making." Or why anyone signed on to make it in the first place.Adjectives describing the movie:  Contrived.  Pointless.  Stupid.  Not funny.  Poorly written.  Manipulative.  Predictable.  Nonsensical. Unbelievable.  Juvenile.  Dull.  Not plausible.  Just really, really bad.Please, don't waste your precious brain cells on this movie.</p>
