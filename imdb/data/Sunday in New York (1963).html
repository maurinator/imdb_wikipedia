<p>One Sunday, twenty-two year old virgin Eileen Tyler decides to take the train from her home in Albany to visit her older brother, airline pilot Adam Tyler, in New York City. The surprise visit is in part to commiserate about the break-up with her fiancé, Russ Wilson, but also to ask Adam for some advice about the issue which led to her and Russ' break-up: if it's all right to have premarital sex. Adam tells her no - that men marry "decent" women - all the while not telling Eileen that he is a chronic womanizer who has sex regularly. Eileen's visit has actually placed a crimp in his plans to spend a sex-filled day with his primary girlfriend, Mona Harris. Being on call may also factor into how Adam spends his day with or without Mona. Regardless of Adam's advice, Eileen decides that she's going to attempt to seduce a stranger while in New York leading to her first sexual experience. Despite the rocky start they have, she thinks that person is Mike Mitchell, a Philadelphia based music critic who was in New York for the day to meet up with a woman, who ultimately stood him up. As Eileen and Mike's relationship goes through its ups and downs during the day, Eileen's decision to seduce Mike may hit a road bump when Russ unexpectedly comes into New York to reconcile with Eileen. Russ comes to his own wrong conclusions about who Mike is in Eileen's life. Russ, Eileen and Mike ultimately have to decide what is important in their respective dating lives.</p>

Adam has been romancing Mona and they have been trying to find some alone time. What ensues is enjoyable chaos and mix ups with Adam and Mona as well as Eileen, Mike and Russ who very unexpectedly drops in to propose and mistakes Mike for Adam.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Was Jane Fonda really this young? In this coy 1963 sex farce written by comedy veteran Norman Krasna (Alfred Hitchcock's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith", "Indiscreet"), she plays Eileen Tyler, a 22-year-old girl from Albany paying an unexpected visit to her airline pilot brother Adam in the Big Apple. She is reeling from a fight with her fiancé Russ who is giving her undue pressure to put out before they marry. Adam assures her that waiting for the wedding night is the right thing to do and then deceives her into thinking he is doing the same. Naturally, he turns out to be a womanizer planning to shag his girlfriend that day. Feeling like the only virgin in the world, Eileen meanwhile engages in a flirtation with a reporter named Mike Mitchell. Complications ensue with mistaken identities and morality questions thrown in to make the plot more interesting.As if you couldn't tell from the swinging title tune sung by Mel Torme, the film is an idealization of early-1960's Manhattan single life that merely toys with the idea of premarital sex well before the concept of free love came into vogue. Guided by TV director Peter Tewksbury, there is a mechanical sitcom feel to the proceedings, but the real NYC locations help and the three leads are game players. Fonda is adorably adroit in a preview of her bouncier work in "Barefoot in the Park", and Cliff Robertson plays Adam's double-standard hypocrisy with agility. However, it's Rod Taylor, fresh from filming Hitchcock's "The Birds", who shines the most as Mike in a deft turn. Jazz pianist and composer Peter Nero supplies the loudly intrusive soundtrack. This film (released just a week before JFK's assassination) has yet to make it to DVD.</p>
