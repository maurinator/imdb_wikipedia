<h1>Roots: The Gift (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The characters of Kunta Kinte and Fiddler from Roots are back in this movie. In this movie the two of them accompany their owner to another plantation at Christmas time and they learn that the son of the owner helps slaves escape. And the two of them try to help him and also see this as an opportunity to escape themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After Kunta Kinte was stripped of his name and sold his soul by confessing that he was now Toby Reynolds, Fiddler now became his soul mate for life. There was a very touching moment at the end of episode 2 of 'Roots' where the Fiddler unties Kunta and offers him some comfort. Kunta's defiance of Mr. Ames displayed who the Fiddler (and the rest of the slaves on the plantation) really was. When the tears came to his eyes it also came to our eyes, and it was then that we really cared about this special relationship amongst two slaves. What other film is there where the audience cares about slaves? 'Roots: The Gift' explores their relationship in greater detail before Kunta grew up to be the John Amos portrayal in episode 3. A beautiful relationship if I may say so myself.</p>
