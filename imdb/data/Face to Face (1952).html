<h1>Face to Face (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two stories. In the first, a sea captain has to conceal a man's presence aboard ship from his crew. In the second, a Wild West lawman has to deal with a troublemaker bent on bloodshed before he can concentrate on matrimony.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Those are two totally different stories, one might ask what brings them together, and most will find no answer, but I will. Stephen Crane and Joseph Conrad are the the two most meaningful writers I have ever read. "The Outcast of the Islands", "Lord Jim" and "The Red Badge of Courage" have reached into me the way no other book did. The first half of the film, based on Conrad's "The Secret Sharer" is about a captain (James Mason) unsure of himself, becoming through a crisis more of a man. The second half, from a story of Stephen Crane "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" is about a Marshall, (Robert Preston), who just got married (Marjorie Steele excellent as the bride) traveling for the first time in a Pullman to his home town where he will meet a man who wants to kill him. There is no better example of how a good screenplay (James Agee) can make a film that otherwise would seem like a TV movie, become such a delight to see.</p>
