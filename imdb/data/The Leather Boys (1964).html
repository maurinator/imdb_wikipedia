<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I caught this film on TV earlier this summer after having first seen it 30 years ago and it was every bit as good as I remembered it.It gains a great deal by not being overt about its gay subtext. This does a lot to increase its poignancy. Beautifully shot and edited ,it also fascinating for the various location shots around south west London. It also to my mind has a undermining sniggering tone to the fairly wooden dialogue amongst the family in the first part of the film..very reminiscent of a Mike Leigh film. Did anyone out there ever remember seeing it in the cinema, as I imagine people would have got more of the references and picked up its satirical tone more acutely then.Music by BillMcGuffie.He also did some arrangements for Sinatra.Check out Dudley Sutton on you-tube</p>
