<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The 6th Day" marks the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to a genre that is second nature to him: action. This time there is an added twist; there is an excellent plot attached."The 6th Day" revolves around a man who has been cloned and ends up on the run from a corporation who wants him dead. Arnold is this man who has lost his family, life and taking on the corporation who took it from him. All the while, Arnold is searching within himself to find a way to get his family back. "The 6th Day" boasts a cast that includes Robert Duvall, Michael Rooker, Tony Goldwyn and Sarah Wynter. I knew the second I saw these names flash across the screen I was in for a real treat. The first time I saw Schwarzenegger's name I immediately knew he is the perfect man for the job.The best thing about "The 6th Day" is the performance of Schwarzenegger because he is not only an action star in this film but a dramatic actor as he combines these two talents to pull off one of his better performances of his career.Arnold did not make this film a hit by himself, he had a little help from his friends. From Robert Duvall who played the doctor who performed the cloning operations to Michael Rooker, who was one evil henchmen with his menacing attitude and presence "The 6th Day" is one great film to see.I enjoyed how the plot of film didn't rely solely on the action sequences. Though, the action is fine and dandy; I believe that a film needs more than just action and "The 6th Day" has it."The 6th Day" is one of the best Arnold films I've seen including the "Terminator" series. It is filled with action, twists, turns, edge of your seat suspense and drama that will appeal to all movie fans of every age.</p>
