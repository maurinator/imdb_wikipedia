<h1>Island of Love (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A con man (Robert Preston) enlists a drunk writer (Tony Randall) to write a fictitious screen play to be funded by a rich but unethical mobster producer. The plot is the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis in the Bible. The plot is to defraud the mobster of his bankroll.</p>
<p>Steve Blair is a New York based con artist. His latest endeavor to make money, which he is doing with his reluctant partner in crime Paul Ferris - a writer who is easily manipulated when he's had a few drinks in him, which is always - is to transform and market the Greek island of Paradeisos from a backwater nothing into a tourist trap of a lovers' haven, partly by dealing in fake antiquities to support the old but recently debunked Greek story of it being the island of love. Steve spent eighteen months on the island during the war. This scheme could make Steve and Paul rich beyond their wildest dreams. Steve and Paul are able to finance this scheme partly from their most recent scam on not too bright New York mobster Tony Dallas, who surrounds himself with yes men. The trip to Greece initially was solely for Steve and Paul to get away from Tony before he found out they bilked him, Tony getting his hands on them which would probably mean their lives. In Paradeisos, Steve is unexpectedly reunited with the Harakas family - Mama Harakas, her now grown daughter Elena Harakas, and her professor "pre"-fianc√© Gregor Pappas - the latter who Steve hopes to be able to use to his advantage as a local historian in verifying the Dionysian "finds". One complicating factor is that Steve is falling in love with Elena, who may not approve if she knew of his deceit. Beyond them possibly being caught in the fraud, there still is the issue of Tony, who has his thugs scouring the globe for Steve and Paul. What Steve and Paul also discover is that Mama's brother, who she hasn't seen in years and who is coming to the island for his honeymoon, may negatively factor into what happens.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My interest in this film is based upon some expatriate Australians living on Hydra at the time this film was made in 1962. Writer George Johnston, his wife, writer Charmain Clift, and their children Martin, Shane and Jason, spent c.10 years living on the Greek island of Hydra as writers. (Johnston began his novel "My Brother Jack" not long after this time). In fact, the children were paid extras in one scene filmed on Hydra. According to Nadia Wheatley's biography, "The Life and Myth of Charmain Clift" (Flamingo, Sydney 2001, pp.420 & note), "a glimpse is sometimes to be had of a stylish woman in a large-brimmed hat, sitting at a harbour cafe. She is Charmain, acting herself" (pp.699). "In the 'Island of Love' film, Shane and Martin can be seen running down a cobbled lane, followed by Jason and his little friend Ellenitza" (p.699). Much to my misfortune, I have never seen this film, and it appears it is no longer available on video or dvd or in any format! Argh! As I said, my main interest in the film as a whole is a very minor one, yet I'd still love to see where these people lives during a critical time in their lives.Maljam - Australia; June 2003.</p>
