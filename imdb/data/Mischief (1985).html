<h1>Mischief (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>1956: The shy Jonathan's luck with girls changes when he wins the rebellious Gene as a friend in his last year of high school. Gene is adored by many girls and manages to teach Jonathan a few lessons. Gene himself would rather just be with one girl: his girlfriend Bunny. But since his father is poor, her parents don't accept him.</p>
<p>Nerdy Jonathan always pined for beautiful and popular Marilyn, but she never looks at him twice, that is, until the cool and calm motorcycle riding Gene Harbrough comes along and teaches Jonathan some lessons in cool and how to get the girl. Gene himself crashes into Bunny, a sweet neighbor with a boyfriend that almost ran over him the first day they met. Now with everyone acquainted to each other, will the Gene get the girl of his dreams, and will Jonathan ever get a chance to score? ( and I'm not talking about a science test!)</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is just about an entire genre of coming-of-age-in-the-'50's movies. Boomer self-absorption/nostalgia, I guess. This is a pretty good one. Kelly Preston was the only cast member I was at all familiar with, and she was lovely. (And naked!) Everyone did a pretty good job here, and all of the cliches were present. A general note for people making films about the '50's. Those beautifully restored vintage '50's cars look great, and I'm sure the filmmakers salivate over photographing them. But for a touch of realism, there should be some '40's vintage cars that look like they have some miles on them, and maybe even one or two beat-up '30's cars. Not everyone has a brand new car, particularly in a small town. Anyway, this film is worth a look. Grade: B</p>
