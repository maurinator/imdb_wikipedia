<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Family Life" is truly a harrowing viewing experience. There is not one second in the film where it seems like the actors on the screen are acting, this film seems totally real from beginning to end, almost like an intense dramatic version of today's reality television programs. The dialog is so seemingly non-scripted and the out-of-control family situations are so vivid that the viewer feels like an invited guest in a home where, immediately after entering, is witness to arguments and strife that come out of nowhere and are as overtaking as a swift house fire. This film reminded me of many such situations that I witnessed as a child in various relatives' homes. A dinner table scene involving a sibling and grandchildren is the best example of this type of all-too-real situation, with the grandparents acting as though the young grandchildren are not going to be harmed by all the verbal jousting despite the fact they are in the direct line of fire. It is also hard to take sides in this scene because everyone on the screen is so incredibly desperate and in need of help. The viewer will probably fear the worst for the characters and ultimately will not be disappointed -- a tragic slice of "Family Life" indeed.</p>
