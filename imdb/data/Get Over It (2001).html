<h1>Get Over It (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Berke Landers, a popular high school basketball star, gets dumped by his life-long girlfriend, Allison, he soon begins to lose it. But with the help of his best friend Felix's sister Kelly, he follows his ex into the school's spring musical. Thus endues a love triangle loosely based upon Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", where Berke is only to find himself getting over Allison and beginning to fall for Kelly.</p>
<p>Berke is devastated when his girlfriend Allison kicks him out. She takes up with cocky Striker, who claims fame as a singer, and the two of them audition for the school's "Midsummer Night's Dream" musical. Berke follows suit, much to the annoyance of his basketball team buddies Felix and Bentley. Our hero finds himself not only in the play but eventually as one of the leads, partly due to help from Felix's sister Kelly. As First Night approaches, questions need answering - Will Berke and Striker come to blows? Can Dennis take over as the lead dancer? Isn't Kelly nicer than Allison anyway?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>GET OVER IT (2001) Rating: 8/10I'll start this review by saying making a musical comedy for teens is a very hard thing to do. Not only to teens in general dislike musicals, but teen comedies with the Shakespeare theme are really growing old and it would be a hard job to come up with something that is fresh and new. Get Over It, a zany and fresh film, does not disappoint. This is a likeable musical that not only teens will enjoy. I'm sure all audiences will find a few qualities and maybe some will love the movie. I found it to be a cutesy, extremely fast (sometimes too fast) and well-built flick. The chemistry between the two leads  Kirsten Dunst and Ben Foster  is very believable and although predictable, the love story is well put-together and generally likeable. The acting is even better. Ben Foster is a strong newcomer and Kirsten Dunst once again proves she is the queen of teen movies, although she better lose that angle soon or she'll be up for Prom Queen once more! However, Martin Short steals the show. Almost every word that came out of his mouth was hilarious to me. I was in a fit laughing. Great characterisation there Martin. Does he realise though that is the second film that he has been in that involves fairies? Maybe he likes the fluttering phonies. The movie does use recycled jokes in places, which disappointed me. However, most of the humour is solid, strong and fresh, so don't worry, even if we have seen a girl fly over a car before while she's running, you'll still laugh. This movie has a great soundtrack, some very cool ideas, great sets, is very funny, romantic and highly enjoyable with some excellent acting and accents. Get Over It is well worth your time; it's not a hard movie to enjoy.</p>
