<h1>Oh, God! You Devil (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>George Burns is back as God, but oops, here he is as Satan, too. A young rock star is ready to sell his soul to Satan, and Satan is all too happy to oblige. Oops! Seems the fellow was watched over by God as a baby, so now the almighty and his nemesis have to duke it out over the soul.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good not great. Not as good as Oh God! but better then Oh God! Book II. I finally saw this today and it was good. Oh God! You Devil is a good ending to the series. So if you liked the first 2 or just the first, then you should like this. George Burns is funny in both roles. So it is a good film. MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. Too bad that we never got a fourth one. Well, enjoy. I hope you like it. I liked it because it has some funny parts and it was appealing and if your a lonely(or feel lonely) then you should like this. so, My overall rating for Oh God! You Devil is 7 out of 10 angels. So enjoy. Thank you. Have a good time while watching it. It has some good slapstick and a good performance by George Burns. So enjoy.</p>
