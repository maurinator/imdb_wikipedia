<p>Filming in the USA, Henri and Fran√ßoise meet and fall in love with each other.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This unknown film is a real gem. I wasn't expecting much, since Claude Lelouch has kind of a weak reputation (I do love his version of Les Miserables, though), but, I figured that Jean-Paul Belmondo is always reason enough to see a film. Definitely, he pushes it far beyond what it could have been otherwise, but also helping him is the wonderful performance of Annie Girardot, an actress about whom I know not a thing, and the great but modest direction of Lelouch. The film begins as if it were going to be one of those run-of-the-mill French dramas where married people cheat on each other. After a while, though the two new lovers go on a cross-country trip from L.A. to NYC (although they don't quite make it there in their rented car). What I would compare this film most to is Linklater's Before Sunrise. I give the film an 8/10.</p>
