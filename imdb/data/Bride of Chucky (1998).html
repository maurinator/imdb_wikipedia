When his old-time sweet heart, Tiffany, picks up his remaining limbs and puts them back together, she performs a ritual that revives the murderous maniac.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From the opening with certain movie killers masks, glove-knife, and chainsaw, to the final scene which looks like it could have been straight from "It's Alive", this movie was camp all the way.Good point: They didn't bring back Andy. New characters and new "homes" for Chuck and Tiff brought a sense of freshness.Bad point: John Ritter. Need I say more? (Although he DOES make a pretty good Pinhead)If you're looking for "The Shining" or the original "Psycjo", spend a couple of bucks and rent them. If you want a good laugh mixed in with some gore, then spend the money here. Just don't take your Siskel & Ebert mindset with you. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie for what it is--self-depreciating schlock.</p>
