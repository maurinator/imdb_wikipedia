<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whether you believe the events depicted in both the novel and film entitled 'The Amityville Horror' or not, you've got to admit it's a great story. One that, frankly, has yet to be adapted faithfully to the big screen. Oh well, maybe some day. Meanwhile, the 1979 film adaptation was followed by one of the biggest slews of sequels in horror movie history. Like with most other franchises, the sequels really aren't necessary, but at the same time that doesn't make them bad films or no fun. This is the case with this second sequel, which took advantage of the 3-D movie craze of the early 1980s. Know what that means? You guessed it, a no-brainer excuse for state-of-the-art special effects to be thrown at the audience. In the case of this movie, that's not a totally bad thing.Pros: The pace never drags. Each cast member, except for maybe Tess Harper, gives the best performance they can with the material and at least seem to be enjoying themselves. Howard Blake, replacing 1 & 2's Lalo Schifrin, composes a decent, spooky score. Director Fleischer does a good job of making the old house look menacing and gets a few other good shots too. At least a couple good chilling moments. Some of the special effects are pretty good. A powerhouse finale. Cheesy fun if you don't take it at all seriously.Cons: Lacks real scares. The plot is super thin and really just an excuse for the filmmakers to use flashy effects. Loaded with haunted house clich√©s. Some cheap effects, especially that one big fly. Tess Harper is the only actor in the film who seems to be uncomfortable and therefore gives a mostly stiff performance.Final thoughts: Won't stand up well to classics like 'Poltergeist' and the original 'The Haunting,' but this second sequel to the 1979 chiller is good clean fun if you're looking for nothing more than an hour and a half of entertainment. Though I enjoyed this on some level, I can see why the subsequent sequels went straight to video because the series was starting to turn into self parody at this point.My rating: 3/5</p>
