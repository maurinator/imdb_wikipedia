<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Consenting Adults" (1992) is a slick looking neo-noir with Kevin Spacey doing a turn as an insurance scam artist. Kevin Kline is the fall guy. The traps that Spacey lays down for Kline are ingenious.The story builds up considerable tension related to Kline's obstacles in clearing his name and voiding the frame-up. Beyond the implausible happenings early in the story that we manage to swallow, we eventually reach a point where the story shifts into conventional thriller mode. The writers at that point throw away cleverness and resort to a typical violent confrontation-type affair that pits hero vs. villain. Our hero uncovers extremely important evidence that can clear him. What does he do? Does he call on the helpful insurance investigator, Forest Whitaker? Does he tell his lawyer, E. G. Marshall? Does he inform the police? No, he doesn't do any of those reasonable things because the writers were not clever enough to find a compelling confrontation despite having chosen one or more of those paths. Maybe there was none. At any rate, the story more or less stops and becomes the conventional physical battle.The movie manages to be just about average as such movies go. At first, I didn't go for it because it was obvious that Spacey was up to no good and Kline was too dense to see it. He was in a fog. Then, after the frame was executed, I liked it and it flowed nicely, up to the point where it went into conventional and predictable thriller mode. Kline was stiff. Spacey relished his role. Kline's wife, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, wasn't given enough opportunity in the script to show her attraction to Spacey to be convincing. Spacey's wife, Rebecca Miller, was a bit of a blank.We were forced to sit through several bluesy songs that were badly sung by Suzie Rose (Q Rose). Her style is said to be soulful and hypnotic. Yes, it will put you to sleep except that it's so irksome. It's dull and boring.The IMDb rating of 5.7 suggests the movie is somewhat below par. I concur.</p>
