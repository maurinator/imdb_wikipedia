<h1>The Wrong Guy (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Cleveland, the histrionic and clumsy executive Nelson Hibbert expects to be promoted to president of the Nigel Industries since he is engaged to the owner's daughter. However, his future father-in-law Mr. Nagel chooses the executive Ken Daly for the position, and Nelson threatens him in front of the board of directors. Later he decides to pay a visit to Mr. Nagel but finds him dead with a knife in his neck. Nelson removes the knife and is covered of blood, becoming hysterical and leaving the office assuming that he is the prime suspect. However, the surveillance cameras disclose the identity of the killer, and while Nelson escapes to Metcaf believing that he is chased by the police, the killer is pursued by the police and tries to eliminate Nelson believing that he is a "super-cop" on his trail.</p>
<p>A nerdy executive (Dave Foley) goes ballistic over being passed over for a promotion to president. Launching into an attack on the new executive in his office, he storms in only to find the man dead with a knife in his neck. Becoming hysterical, he storms out of the office and assumes everyone will think he committed the crime. So naturally he takes off as a fugitive. Only problem is the office cameras caught the crime and have already revealed the murderer. Fleeing to Mexico, the executive runs into the real killer (Colm Feore) who is being pursued by a detective (David Higgins). Naturally he thinks the detective is after him.</p>
<p>After his boss is murdered, Nelson is on the run for fear of prosecution. He hides out in a small town to avoid the police, which should be easy because they know he didn't do it and they aren't looking for him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I saw this movie I laughed so hard I actually had to pause it at times so I wouldn't miss anything. I thought perhaps it was "just me", and that most people might not find it all that funny (it has STUPID humour) but I have very rarely heard of anyone who has not found it equally hilarious. WATCH IT!!! you won't regret it. The train sequence alone makes it worth seeing. I can't count how many times I've recalled a scene or a line from this movie and laughed out loud, even in public, which has given me plenty of opportunities to spread the word about this hilarious movie.Dave Foley is brilliant! It's a shame that this movie never really saw the light of day, but I truly believe it's time will come. If you enjoy comedy, don't miss out on this film.</p>
