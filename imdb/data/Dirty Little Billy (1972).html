<h1>Dirty Little Billy (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A more realistic, based-on-reality, unsensationalistic portrayal of the gritty early years of one of the most famous Wild West outlaws in history, Billy The Kid.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This realistic and harsh re-telling of the Billy the Kid myth is definitely worth anyone's time.  Pollard is perfect as a none-too-bright Western punk who unfortunately became infamous.  It stars the beautiful Lee Purcell and Gary Busey in a supporting role.  Arthur Penn's Left-Handed Gun was very good and this is the second best version of that often-botched story of this kid.Great and grungy cinematography, true-to-life costume design, interesting soundtrack and authentic western types in a downbeat, almost Cassavetes-like version of the tale.  A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Michael J. Pollard.  If you can find it, check this moody piece of Western Americana.  One of Pollard's best films!</p>
