<h1>Sister, Sister (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Matt Rutledge is on business in the Louisiana country. He decides to stay at an old house which is a bed-and-breakfast type of place owned by two sisters, Charlotte and younger Lucy. Charlotte is in and out of love with town sheriff Cleve Doucet while seductive Lucy is attracted to Matt.</p>
<p>Orphans Charlotte and her kid sister on tranquilizers, frail Lucy, run their ancestral Louisiana estate as a B&B.; Businessman and guest Matt Rutledge becomes shy Lucy's lover. Matt ignores a warning to leave for his own safety by Etienne LeViolette, the girls' studly friend in the nearby bayou swamp, the only one who suspects that Charlotte is a killer after the disappearance and presumed murder of Lucy's first lover, local adolescent Jud Nevins. Sherif Cleve Doucet suspects Etienne, but also digs into the past, which holds a more elaborate dark secret leading to more bloodshed.</p>
<p>Two sisters turn their family mansion in Louisiana into a guest house. One of their guests is an aide to a congressman, and turns their lives inside out.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two sisters (Judith Ivey and Jennifer Jason Leigh) turn their family mansion in Louisiana into a guest house. One of their guests (a young Eric Stoltz) is an aide to a congressman, and turns their lives inside out. Director Bill Condon is interesting -- this was his debut film, but it seems his career really blossomed in the 2000s with a string of hits: "Kinsey" (2004), "Dreamgirls" (2006), "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn  Part 1" (2011) and "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn  Part 2" (2012). Humble beginnings?I actually did not find this to be all that great of a film. The cast helped it (Jennifer Leigh can do no wrong). But really, just not a film I am eager to see again and that is all I have to say.</p>
