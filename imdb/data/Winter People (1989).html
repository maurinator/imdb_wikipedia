<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a surprisingly wonderful movie. I love the mountains, and the way these people lived was incredibly awesome.This story makes me feel like going to the highest mountains to live. The actors were perfect for each part.The way these folks dealt with real life was real justice. They did it the way it should be done. The way they tracked down all the evidence was amazing. Their skills were uncanny. At the end, GODS hand turned even the hardest heart into a soft one. The decency was there, and things were as they should be.If you haven't seen this movie, please take time to watch it. It is GREAT.</p>
