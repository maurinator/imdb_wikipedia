<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beautifully photographed in black and white this film should be considered a MASTERPIECE! Haley Millsgives the performance of her career (maybe next to"Tiger Bay) as Cathy. Alan Bates is also excellent!  It is  real shame that these classic films do not get airplay on cable.</p>
