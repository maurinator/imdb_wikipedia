<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Walking Across Egypt" is a pleasant little film whose entertainment comes mainly from the dialogue and interaction. Yes, it's fairly predictable, but you almost can't help be charmed by the rich character development. The filmmakers did an excellent job creating a little Southern town where everyone knows everyone and everything. Fantastic starring role by Ellen Burstyn.</p>
