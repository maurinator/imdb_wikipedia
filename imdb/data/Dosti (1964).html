<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I stumbled across this great movie in a somewhat unusual way. I was an American student in Cairo, on a fellowship to study Arabic, way back in 1971. I'm not sure exactly why I bought a ticket and went to see this movie, but I came out feeling as though everything in my life had changed, a little bit anyway.I went back to America and then the search began. I found an old recording of the soundtrack -- made in Dum Dum, India as I recall. The songs were one of the best parts of the movie, and so in this way I came to know the soaring voice of M. Rafi, a man with a voice to rival Luciano.But I could never find a videotape, or a DVD, or anything, until FINALLY this week I was able to order a DVD from Music House in the UK. I have my fingers crossed! :-) This review is mostly to let others know that there is a DVD out there.</p>
