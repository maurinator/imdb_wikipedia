<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The best film ever of Dilip and Vyjantimala.These two took acting to unprecedented realms in this great movie.Script,music,photography,editing....all the aspects that make a movie are near perfect.Only weak point would be Nasir Khan who is badly mis-casted as the younger brother but it seems that his presence brings such impact from Dilip Kumar that one is left awe-strucked.The story is perhaps not new but it is the realism of the film that attracts the mind.Who will forget the scene of the dying Dhano with Gunga imploring her not to leave him alone in the world.You feel how much she means to him as if the drama was being played right in front of you instead of on the screen.Magnificent!Similarly the scene where Gunga see off his brother at the railway station is too good to be true.The supporting cast is marvelous.Anwar Hussain gives an excellent performance as well as Kaniyalal and Sohrab Modi in a cameo role.And what to say of the music? You have to see the film to really enjoy it because it is made for it.A milestone in the Indian film history.</p>
