<h1>Sour Grapes (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two cousins and friends, Richie and Evan, go to Atlantic City to gamble. Richie loses all he has at slot machines and asks Evan for two more coins for a last attempt. That last attempt brings a $400,000 jackpot for Richie. No wonder Evan turns greedy and jealous.</p>
<p>SOUR GRAPES is what you get when lots of money ignites a runaway chain of events including deceit, destruction and dissolution all because two cousins can't figure out how to share 50 cents. Richie, a sneaker sole designer, and his cousin Evan, a brain surgeon, are spending this weekend with their girlfriends in Atlantic City. Having exhausted their gambling funds, Richie drops his last quarter into a slot machine. Evan advises him that he needs two more quarters to really make it big and proceeds to give him the extra coins. Richie pulls the lever. Moments later, three grapes across, Richie is scooping up a $436,000 jackpot. Does Evan get two-thirds of the payoff for two-thirds of the investment? Not in Richi's eyes. How about half? No dice.</p>
<p>Richie, a sneaker sole designer, and his cousin Evan, a brain surgeon, are spending this weekend with their girlfriends in Atlantic City. When one of them ends up with a $436,000 jackpot, sour grapes is what results. Even though Richie uses two quarters from Evan to win the progressive jackpot, he sees no connection with that and sharing the jackpot. This ignites a hilarious, runaway chain of events including deceit, destruction and dissolution in the family as everyone seems to side strongly with one side or the other.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really don't know whats wrong with people. Movies that really suck and are devoid of any humor are considered funny and movies that are genuinely funny get a 5.2 rating?   So this movie isn't exactly supposed to be intelligent or thought provoking or even too subtle for that matter but what it does is make you laugh. Not just slight chuckles but laugh till your stomach hurts.  The lead characters also do a pretty good job. The guy who wins the million dollars has a dialogue delivery style very similar to Norm McDonald (which is a good thing). It has this underlying sarcastic tone that makes almost anything he says funny.    Like the Seinfeld series this movie too isn't about a real plot or anything but its amazing how creative people can be making you laugh with some of the silliest gags ever.   After watching this film I felt light-headed. Almost anything seemed to amuse me after that. All day I had this annoying grin on my face with sudden outbursts of laughter just thinking about the movie.     I know a good/funny movie when I see one. This one is genuinely funny. Try not to look for meaning or depth in it and you'll love it. Take my word for it. Its well worth your time.</p>
