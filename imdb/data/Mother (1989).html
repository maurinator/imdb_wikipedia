<h1>Mother (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Blue Ribbon winner at the American Film Festival, this hard-hitting, dramatic production is about the relationship between a young man with AIDS and his estranged mother. Unable to understand or accept each other's lives, mother and son are at a stalemate of their own making. The story is about family and unconditional love and AIDS. It is a story that has been lived by many who have already died, and one that will help those who are living with AIDS to regain the love and support of their families. The cast includes Polly Bergen, Piper Laurie, Bess Armstrong, and John Dye.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am lucky enough to own a copy of this film, and as such I have watched it about a dozen times.  Whenever I want to remember how special I am to have the mother I have, or the friends I have, I plop it in.  And then I cry. So, yes, I also watch it whenever I want to have a good cry.  I mean, a GOOD GOOD cry.The acting is first rate.  The directing is wonderful.  And, although it is very short, it packs just the right amount of whollup into its brief existence.I recommend it highly and without reservation to all:  mothers, sons, daughters, and fathers.</p>
