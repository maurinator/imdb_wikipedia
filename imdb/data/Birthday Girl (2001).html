<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice.  And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be.  This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be.  Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better.  Three out of four stars.  9/5/02.</p>
