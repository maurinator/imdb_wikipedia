<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I won't fight with Phil Kafcaloudes synopsis of the movie, its spot on, I just wanted to add my comment on the final jazz scene in Paris.Every time i have described that scene to friends and all, I cry. Tears of joy mind you,Reason? Its because of the look on Colin Friels' face,a kid in candyland for the first time, maybe, you can see he is in seventh heaven , the only dream he ever had is coming true in front of us the movie audience and in front of the live audience in the Paris club,The moment just takes you to a special place of powerful emotions of Happiness.what can i say? i cry at movies , so sue me!! grinp.s. this is ridiculous even writing a comment has made me cry!!</p>
