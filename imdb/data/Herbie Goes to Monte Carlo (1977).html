<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Herbie goes to Monte Carlo is my first favorite "Herbie" film.  My favorite scenes were:  The scene when the diamond thieves are chasing Herbie through the French country side and my other favorite scene was when Dean Jones and Don Knotts got into a fight with the diamond thieves.  The whole movie is funny but I thought those were the funniest scenes.  Don Knotts is hilarious as usual, just like on the "Andy Griffith" show.A cute scene I liked was when Herbie was taking a shower from the splashing water of a big fountain.</p>
