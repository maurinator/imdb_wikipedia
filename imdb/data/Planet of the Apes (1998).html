<h1>Planet of the Apes (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This documentary was shown as part of the American Movie Classics (AMC) cable TV channel's celebration of the 30th anniversary of the release of Planet of the Apes (1968). We learn how the original French novel was transformed into the first film; the problems that the producers encountered during production of the entire series (often involving shrinking budgets); how the stories related to current events (e.g., the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement); and how the series became a pervasive part of American popular culture. The film includes interviews with virtually all of the people involved in the production of the film series, including all the main performers. Personal movies taken on the shooting sets and early ape makeup test footage (with Edward G. Robinson and James Brolin!) are also featured.</p>
<p>The story behind the making of the 5 "Planet of the Apes" movies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am no fan of "The making of....whatever" as it invariably tells you nothing and more likely than not, totally wrecks the film itself once you have seen the out-takes or "How they did...."This is an extremely well put together and interesting look at the original "Apes" series, more so now, having the late Roddy McDowall as narrator. (Roddy you may remember played Caesar!)Might have been an idea if Tim Burton had watched this before embarking on his pointless re-hash with Mark Wahlberg!</p>
