<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I mainly purchased the DVD, because of two reasons:  Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen.  I'm quite an admirer of both actors.  I have virtually no knowledge about the stock market, or about stocks themselves.  Those who are in the market or have vast knowledge about stocks will probably enjoy the film much more.  However, I still enjoyed the film.  When a movie's really good, it doesn't matter whether or not the audience member is interested in the topic.  Besides, the film boils down to basic universal themes, like selling your soul to the devil and money being the root of all evil.    The characters are interesting and richly developed, with the exception of Darryl Hannah's underwritten character.  I can see why she didn't like playing that role.  Douglas is always a joy to watch, and makes a suave yet slimy villain.  I wouldn't necessarily say he deserved an Oscar, but he did a fine job nonetheless.  So did Charlie Sheen, who is actually the star of the film despite the fact that most people remember "Wall Street" for Douglas as Gordon Gecko.  Sheen gives a fine multi-dimensional performance.  I love the scenes between him and his father Martin Sheen, who plays his father in the film.  Oliver Stone made a great choice casting the father-and-son team, since the tension in their scenes feels very authentic.There are some predictable plot turns and character arcs, but altogether Stone keeps the excitement going.  I like how the climactic scene between Douglas and Sheen is shot without cuts, with the camera moving from person to person, keeping the tension going.  If I knew at least an inkling about the stock market, I wouldn't be completely lost during certain scenes, but what can you do?  I still think it's a fine film with solid performances.  My score:  7 (out of 10)</p>
