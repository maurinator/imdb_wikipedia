<h1>Loot (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the play by Joe Orton, this film follows the adventures of two pals who have pulled off a bank robbery and have to hide the loot. Fortunately one of them works in a funeral parlor and they have a coffin to spare. Then there's the gold-digger nurse and the gonad-grabber detective and a host of other wonderful characters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am rarely tempted to add my own thoughts on any film on IMDb, but when the review for the black farce that is LOOT is compared less than favourably to WEEKEND AT BERNIES in all seriousness then even I feel I have to hitch up the keyboard and redress the situation.These are two films that are from totally different worlds.W.A.B's is an American teen romp, the kind that keep the tit and ass count down to get as many 15 year olds in to the multiplex, whilst LOOT is the second to last play written by Joe Orton the darling of the mid sixties theatre scene in London.Now I have never particularly liked LOOT as a play or as a film, preferring Entertaining Mr Sloane, Berly Reid's performance being worth the price of admission alone, but to compare it to W.A.B.'s is like comparing Hamlet to GHOST because of the presence of a spook in them. But it is easily a far superior film, yes it is a little creaky and the farce is shoe horned in but then that was Orton's style. LOOT is an example of the sad fag end of the sixties as they misfired to a close.I half expect to see Withnail and I come lurching over the horizon like spectres.Weekend At Bernies indeed.see also "Entertaining Mr.Sloane" and the bio pic "Prick Up Your Ears".</p>
