<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As her family falls apart, seventeen year old Sweetness O'Hara is left to fend for herself in a neighborhood where her survival is uncertain.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw a screening of this film at the Mixed Roots Festival in Los Angeles, June 11, 2011. It is an excellent film. It is very well written, with prominent actors. I found the story entirely believable, and was moved to see the lead characters portrayed as capable of transformation and growth. Both Jason Clarke and Zoe Kravitz were superb in their roles as father and daughter torn between love and anger, and all actors carried their roles with great skill and realism. I have never submitted a film review before, but we were asked to review Yelling to the Sky in the hope that it will advance to the general theater circuit; therefore I am sending my thoughts and my vote.</p>
