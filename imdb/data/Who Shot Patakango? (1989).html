<p>A coming-of-age tale set in Brooklyn during the late '50s which centers around the high school life of a group of teens that have to deal with racial tensions at their interracial vocational high school.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I also rented this film b/c of Sandra and she was the only good thing in it. She was close to looking age appropriate but just about everyone else looked too old to even be in college, except maybe in night school. The school yard was empty, there were no cars on the street and the plot was limp. Lame, lame, lame. I am also from Brooklyn and grew up in this time frame. I actually remember kids breaking antennas off cars to make zip guns and there was one fatal outcome. If the film had served as a warning about how dangerous guns are then perhaps it would have some redeeming value aside from Sandra appearing sans clothes. (Thnx for that.)Interested in hooligans in high school? Then stick with Blackboard Jungle, the first Rock and Roll movie.</p>
