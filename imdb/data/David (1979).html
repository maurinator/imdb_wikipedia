<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Shown on the International Channel, DAVID (1979) is an above average film about the Jewish holocaust.  We see the central character's family fairly safe and secure in Leignitz, Germany at the start of 1933.  David's family is unaware of the advancing Nazi plague.  When the Nazis begin to become active, most Germans are seen to be indifferent.  When the treatment of the Jews becomes brutal, we see the many ways in which the Leignitz Jews react.The promos for DAVID claim that the film is about a boy surviving only on his wits as he travels from Hitler's Germany to the Middle East.  In truth, this is not the plot at all.  The escape from Germany amounts to only 20 or 30 seconds of visual dissolves.DAVID is about the holocaust in Germany from the Jewish point of view.  David and his friends and family seek refuge from the Nazis.  We see some Jews be overly optimistic.  We see some give up.  We see many view what is taking place in utter disbelief -- a feeling that successfully transfers to the audience.  DAVID is subtle rather than epic.  It has a factual tone, rather than filled with grand dramatics.  I have not seen a holocaust movie that is any better.</p>
