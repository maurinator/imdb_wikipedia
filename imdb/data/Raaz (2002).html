<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After you have seen endless popsicle movies with one Clown who self proclaims himself as the greatet actor and the imbeciles of the media who praises him to the hilt that is decadance of an Industry and you begin to wonder the state of the Industry,then comes along movies that puts your faith back in the Hindi movies and Raaz is one of them. Consummate actors like Aushotosh Rana,The haunting melody of the music that was the staple of the yester years,the location (Ooty or Ootacamund, a hill station the Indian Switzerland),the Ace direction by one of the top directors, good looking actors,the thrill of watching a movie is back. Raaz is one of the best romantic thriller after "Bees Sal Baad" a classic of the sixties.</p>
