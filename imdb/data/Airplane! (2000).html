<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not too much is going on in this poorer offering as the main story of the episode turned out to be a non-funny adventure on an airplane. For some reason Mike and Caitlin are flying out west for a conference. During the uninteresting flight, the two talk about their relationship until one finally wishes that the flight would crash to give the story some excitement. It was a boring trek that seem to continue down a horrid track until nothing was left but the credits. The only thing that saved the episode from being a complete disaster was the other stories going on in the background.Carter is on a protest and hungry strike concerning a business that is endangering wildlife. During the protest, Stuart arrives on the scene and takes the thunder away from Carter. Now Carter believes that he does little in changing the city for the better.-- There is also another small story about the Mayor, Paul and James changing a light-bulb that went no where. But even changing a light-bulb was better than the airplane ride through hell that was suppose to be the main story of the episode.With the airplane ride not amusing in the least, proves that Mike/Caitlin story has played out and most people are ready to move on. It actually became painful to watch as the viewer was expecting some kind of humor but was disappointed to learn that nothing of interest was delivered. The story of Carter and Stuart was the best thing in the episode but still could not penetrate the boredom that had already set in during the plane skit. Every so often a series has an episode that does not live up to the standard of the show. This was their clunker.</p>
