<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There is not much of a plot in this movie and fortunately it wastes relatively little time in developing it.  Melanie Griffith is miscast as a cop. However, her acting, while not great, is not as bad as some have said. The main point of the movie, as far as I am concerned, is to portray aspects of the Hasidic community, which most people do not know much about.  This movie tells much more about the Hasidim than Witness told of about the Amish.  For this alone the movie is worth watching.</p>
