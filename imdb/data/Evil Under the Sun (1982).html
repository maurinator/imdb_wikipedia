<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Ustinov recreates the role of Poirot, following the wonderful Death On The Nile.   This is not the story as Agatha Christie wrote it, but here we have a rare example of the movie being better than the book.  In fact it would be more accurate to say that here we have a murder mystery based on an idea by Miss Christie.  We are presented with is a cast of characters, a murder victim, and just about everyone has a motive. Poirot of course, deduces who did it.  The sun in question, under which this evil takes place, shines down on a privately owned island in the Mediterranean, giving us a warm and exotic location.There isn't one bad performance among the cast, several of whom have appeared before in at least one other Poirot story.  Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin in Evil Under The Sun;  Dennis Quilley and Colin Blakely in Murder On The Orient Express.   Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith almost steal the show as two women who smile sweetly at each other as they spit venom!  But every bit as good are Blakely, Quilley, Mason, McDowall and the rest.  And while all this is going on, the soundtrack is solid gold Cole Porter, which has been orchestrated perfectly to fit the story.This movie is pure fun.  Make yourself comfortable, suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be transported to another era and location for a couple of hours of enjoyment.</p>
