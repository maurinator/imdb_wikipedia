<h1>Unhook the Stars (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Character study about Mildred, an elderly woman who has spent her life caring for others. When her daughter finally leaves home, she finds that, for the first time in her life, she has nobody to worry about - but soon becomes involved in the life of Monica, a young mother whose husband has left her to look after her young son J.J.. As the relationship blossoms, Monica teaches Mildred that there is more to life than taking care of others.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Targeted to the intelligent, non-adolescent.  Character driven story, extraordinarily well written.  How did this ever get the green light from a major studio?  Marisa Tomei displays her trademark ability to portray hard edged, gritty women.</p>
