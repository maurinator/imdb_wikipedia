Perhaps he will be lucky, and his bad luck could help to find the unlucky girl...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My wife and I enjoyed the movie and got a laugh from it. You can watch it with your Kids! Get the pop-corn out. Kids from 8 to 13 will get a kick out of this. (well most will). My family loved Its A Mad Mad Mad world ,and have watched it many times. Pure Luck is not worth as many viewings, but is well worth an evening with the kids. Martin Short is the most unlucky person and Danny Glover is funny as well. There are not many movies theses days that can whole family can watch together. There is not much to find offensive in this movie. If you would like to see the range that Danny Glover can play watch this and Gone Fishing (with the kids). Then put them to bed and watch SwitchBack. I like him better in the comic roles but he can be sinister as well.</p>
