<h1>Prince Valiant (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young Prince Valiant, son of the exiled King of Scandia, journeys to Camelot to become a knight at King Arthur's Round Table. He hopes to help his father reclaim his throne from the pagan Viking usurper Sligon and restore the Christian faith to their homeland. On his journey he stumbles upon a mysterious Black Knight plotting with Sligon's representatives to overthrow Arthur. Barely escaping with his life, Valiant encounters Sir Gawain, one of the most illustrious knights of the Round Table, and an old friend of his father's, who tutors the young Viking in the skills needed to be a knight. Valiant and Gawain's pupil-mentor relationship is complicated by their romantic involvement with Princess Aleta and her sister Ilene, daughters of the King of Ord. If Valiant is to restore his father's throne and prevent the coup d'etat against Arthur, he must uncover the true identity of the Black Knight.</p>
<p>After his father is overthrown as the Christian King of Scandia, his son, Prince Valiant, travels to the court of King Arthur at Camelot in hopes of being made a knight of the Round Table. On his way there, he has an encounter with a Black Knight, whose mysterious movements have stirred unease at Camelot. Before Valiant can become a knight, he must first serve as a squire, and Sir Gawain takes on the responsibility of training him in the skills of knightly combat. Valiant eventually meets the beautiful Aleta, daughter of the King of Ord; in introducing Gawain to his new love, Valiant gives Gawain the mistaken impression that Aleta is in love with him, and then does the honorable thing by refusing to disabuse the older knight of his romantic thoughts about her. Valiant and Aleta are taken prisoner by Vikings but manage to escape and assist in thwarting a plot by the Black Knight to overthrow King Arthur.</p>
<p>A young Viking prince strives to become a knight in King Arthur's Court and restore his exiled father to his rightful throne.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While not nearly as good as Hal Foster's comic strip, this film is not nearly as bad as some reviewers would have you believe.  James Mason makes a fine villain, and the action scenes are well directed by Hathaway.  The biggest problem is that it is, after all, a fifties film, with all the good and bad points of the fifties.  I am a big fan of the fifties, because it is the decade in which I started watching movies, but I am also aware that relatively low budgets and heavy handed censorship made even the best fifties films somewhat dubious -- e.g. A Streetcar Named Desire without any hint of homosexuality.  Comparing Prince Valiant to most modern knights in armor films, I find it more fun than, say, Black Knight or Timeline.</p>
