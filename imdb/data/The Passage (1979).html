<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those films that haunts you years after seeing it.  I remember when I first saw it I was horrified.  I watched it again and the violence, although horrific, was easier to get past.  McDowell is creepy (as always).  Quinn is great (as always).  Lenz, well what can I say, acting not great, but nice to look at.  The violence is extreme in a few scenes, so be warned.  All in all, a pretty good movie.  I give it a 7.</p>
