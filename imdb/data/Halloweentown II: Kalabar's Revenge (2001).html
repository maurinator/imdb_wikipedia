But now the son of the Cromwells' old enemy Kalabar has a plan to use the grandmother's book to turn Halloweentown into a grey dreary version of the real world, while transforming the denizens of the real world into monsters. Only Marnie, a fledgling witch, can thwart the evil scheme.</p>
<p>The Cromwell clan split their time between the real world and "Halloweentown", but the son of an old rival threatens to make the latter "real" and the real world a place of monsters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Oh Lord, I've watched so many bad movies...but I'll tell you...this one SUCKS!  No one except the little girl...(marnies sister) can even remotely act.  The town was difrent, do people really not notice this stuff?!?! The worst thing I thing has to be how Marnie "saves the day".  The same as the last time.  This movie has really bad actors, lame music, and a horrible concept!  'Little girls can do big things if they try..Work together!'  Oh Lord...I will NEVER let my little cousins watch it. I don't believe in polluting the minds of little ones.   Bottom line : THIS MOVIE SUCKS! .5/10 stars</p>
