<h1>Strange Behavior (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Widowed John Brady is the Chief of Police in small town Galesburg, Illinois, where he has lived most of his life. His only offspring, Pete Brady, is a bright high school senior. John has been in turmoil since the suspicious death of his wife Catherine years earlier, which he always believed had something to do with her boss, Dr. Le Sange, who himself died shortly after Catherine's passing. Only recently has John and Pete's home life gotten back on track with John dating Barbara Moorehead, a waitress at the local hangout, she who has known John for some time. John's life takes a turn for the worse when he has to investigate the brutal slashing murders of four townsfolk in four separate incidents. A brief eyewitness statement to one of the murders before the eyewitness herself is murdered is the only substantive evidence. However, the three other victims were the sons of long time friends of his. Those three friends have a special connection to John's past. As such, he believes if the pattern holds true that Pete may be the next intended target. What John is unaware of is that Pete, who has been trying to earn a little extra money in nearby Galesburg College in the Psychology Department with Mrs. Gwen Parkinson, is not the next target but that he unwittingly has a connection to the next intended murder.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this inventive and well-produced thriller in the mid-nineties via a full-screen Rhino Video cassette I bought--this is not a film that is easy to find in most video stores (I currently have it on DVD and, I must say, it is like a new film, immaculate and widescreen in all of its Panavision glory). Well, when I saw this deliciously tongue-in-cheek flick, I fell in love with it instantly. The direction by Michael Laughlin was tight and effective; Bill Condon's script was clever, funny and twisty; Louis Horvath's provocative and incredibly colorful cinematography was impressive; the Tangerine Dream score was stunning and dream-like; and, in the lead, Michael Murphy, towering and unforgettable, was both brilliantly subtle and medium cool, as well as intense and humanly believable. Along with fine supporting turns from Louis Fletcher, Fiona Lewis, Arthur Dignam, Scott Brady and Charles Lane, the whole film is quite satisfying.It's hard to describe this film in a few short, concise words, so I choose to say that "Strange Behavior" is like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" meets "Halloween" meets "Blue Velvet." It's an atmospheric, genre-busting, deliciously quirky slice of cinematic cleverness. A must for genuine horror film enthusiasts.</p>
