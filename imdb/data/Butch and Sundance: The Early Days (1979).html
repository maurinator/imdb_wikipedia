<h1>Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A prequel of sorts to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) which chronicles the two outlaws' lives in the years before the events portrayed in the 1969 movie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Under-Shown, under-appreciated, underrated and vastly overlooked gem. An entertaining little western with good performances and situations and with some genuinely funny lines. Look for Christopher Lloyd and John Schuck in brief but humorous character roles, and the menacing Brian Dennehy who offsets William Katt in the film's main gunfight. By no means the heavyweight and complex picture starring Newman and Redford that we all know and love but it gets along quite amiably on its own merits and does nothing at all to offend or tarnish the memory of George Roy Hill's classic. Still, one wonders just how great and memorable the premise could have been if it had been produced in the 90's with Matthew McConaughey and Brad Pitt as the younger Butch and Sundance.  Think about it.  While you do, pour yourself a shot of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid then watch Early days as the chaser.</p>
