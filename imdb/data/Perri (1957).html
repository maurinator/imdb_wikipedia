<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perri, one of Disney's finest examples of "true life fantasy" nature movies is best described as a purely cinematic experience.  Few films demonstrate the potential of motion pictures, but Perri does.  Contained within this masterpiece of film is a hibernation/dream sequence that cannot be described in human terms.  I don't know what God is, but I know it when I see it; and Perri is divine revelation .</p>
