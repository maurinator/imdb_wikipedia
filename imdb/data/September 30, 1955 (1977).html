<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>4 out of 10     The title represents the date that the legendary and truly great actor James Dean died in a car crash.  His death has an adverse effect on a group of teens in a small southern town.     Thomas is the main character who , along with his girlfriend Billie Jean, seems to get the most upset.  Although some of his actions may seem fanatical it is really not as extreme or as a fanatical as you may think it would be or could have been.  At no time does he become so immersed in it that he loses sight of reality.  At times it really becomes more of a story of lost young souls looking for an identity than it does on celebrity worship.       The story itself is pretty slow and has a lot of long drawn out takes.  There are times when the drama gets just a little too heavy.  The ending is especially unsatisfying as it doesn't even give us a hint as to whatever became of these characters who are all left in unfinished scenarios. In the final analysis this thing is nothing more than another one of those sappy 70's teen romance tragedies.     Beyond the poor structure there are indeed some good things going on here.  One is the just the chance of seeing such budding young talents working together and carrying a film.  The other is director Bridges who shows some really good insight into Dean's mystic and why he made such a strong connection with the youth.  You have the feeling that Bridges himself was a really big Dean fan.  He also makes a good statement about just how many lost, lonely souls there are out there and the stifling nature of small town life especially during that period.  He also recreates an excellent 50's flavor maybe some of the best you will ever see.  The interactions between the characters seems very real and there is good historical accuracy.  Bridges is honest with his assessment of the 50's and yet is not condescending to it like with a lot of other movies.  He digs beyond just the period detail.  You really feel, at least during the first hour, that you are right there and a part of the 50's experience, which is interesting and fun.     Overall Bridges shows signs of being a serious up and coming filmmaker.  Unfortunately he tries a little too hard here.  It seems too labored and trapped by the sensibilities of it's era.  It is also completely humorless, too talky, and an eventual bore.</p>
