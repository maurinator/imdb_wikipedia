<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Concrete Jungle" is a stereotypical women in prison film of the exploitation variety, with a lower than usual quotient of female nudity. It has all the other elements present, however. There is a tough warden, played by the miscast Jill St. John who seems out of her element. And this warden runs a drug racket with the inmate, Barbara Luna. All the guards are stern, barking orders constantly. Misbehavior gets the innocent Tracy Bregman thrown into the "hole", which is the usual solitary cell that gets no sunlight and where the food is a bowl of porridge. The male guards rape the women they want to. Everyone kowtows to Luna who has St. John behind her.The main impression this film leaves is its inane exaggeration. Beyond that, what warden could ever trust an inmate as a confederate without having something to hold over that prisoner's head? Even the, the risk is enormous. Why does Bregman not listen to the advice to avoid Luna? Why turn around and do the opposite, accepting her gifts when she's an obvious sexual target?</p>
