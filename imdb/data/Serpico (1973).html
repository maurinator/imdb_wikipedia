<h1>Serpico (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Serpico is a cop in the 1960s-early 1970s. Unlike all his colleagues, he refuses a share of the money that the cops routinely extort from local criminals. Nobody wants to work with Serpico, and he's in constant danger of being placed in life threatening positions by his "partners". Nothing seems to get done even when he goes to the highest of authorities. Despite the dangers he finds himself in, he still refuses to 'go with the flow', in the hope that one day, the truth will be known.</p>
<p>In the 1960s In New York City, the idealistic Italian descendant Frank Serpico joins the New York Police Department and on his first day, he learns that his colleagues are dirty, sharing money received from the extortion of criminals. Serpico refuses to receive the money and reports to a superior. Along the years, his superior does not take any attitude against the corruption and Serpico is an outcast police officer, rejected by his fellows. Further, his personal life is affected and he is harassed and threatened by his colleagues. In 1971, in a drug bust, Serpico is betrayed and shot in the face. He recovers with minor sequels and testifies to the Knapp Commission about the police corruption. Finally, Switzerland gives political to him and he moves to that country.</p>
<p>Frank Serpico is a young, inexperienced cop who starts out on patrol. Later, he starts to work as an undercover cop who busts all sorts of criminals, but mostly drug dealers and pushers. Since Serpico is a young man living in the 1960s and early 1970s, he lives as one. His image, based on how others look on him, shows him as just a 'hippie' and the criminals he busts have no idea he is really an undercover officer. Everything is working out well, except the money situation. Serpico refuses to accept money, as the other officers do. He feels this isn't right, and wants to expose the situation. Who he thought were his friends now turn into his enemies when Serpico takes the stand on a grand jury investigation. He continues to work undercover, and his life is placed into jeopardy at the hands of his colleagues.</p>
<p>Biopic of the New York City detective whose anti-corruption efforts in the 1960s and early 1970s led to the creation of the Knapp Commission and the uncovering of widespread corruption of police officials at all levels. All of his life, Frank Serpico had wanted to be a policeman. He learns at an early stage in his career however that even the cop on the beat is somewhat corrupt accepting free meals and the like. As he advances in his career he finds that corruption is rampant, particularly in the Plainclothes Division, where they collect more in graft that they do in salary. His refusal to take any money puts him in bad stead with his colleagues to the point that his life may be in danger. Transferred to the Narcotics Squad, he is shot by a drug dealer when his partners fail to support him. Serpico resigned from the NYPD in 1972.</p>
<p>The true story about an honest New York cop who blew the whistle on rampant corruption in the force only to have his comrades turn against him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sidney Lumet proved himself to be a highly competent and effective director/storyteller for the true story of New York Officer Frank Serpico, who became famous after appearing to testify before the NAPA Commission about payoffs and corruption in the Police Department. At the time, it was unheard of, and it gained Peter Maars attention to write the book, which thus got transferred to the screen as so. But what makes Serpico such a riveting and eye catching picture today are the little things about it, little details in specific scenes and locations that help ring Serpico's emotions far more than true- it's just there. Even more amazing on the part of the actual filming of the movie is that it was at the time filmed backwards (started with the beard, then the mustache, then clean-shaven).Al Pacino, right off of the first part of the Godfather trilogy, took this role with all the fire and compassion that he had in him. He sees in Serpico not just an honest cop wanting some balance and honor in his work, yet also a man, who can get as joyful and humorous as he can act subtle, furious, and thoughtful. This will always remain one of his stand-out roles after all the Scarfaces and Scent of a Woman pictures he can do because he, as well as Lumet, know how to approach such a saga. Plenty of great, compelling set pieces, and even sweet ones (like when he first buys the sheepdog as a puppy). A+</p>
