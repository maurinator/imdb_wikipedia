<h1>In the Mood (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based upon the true story of "Sonny" Wisecarver. In 1944, Sonny made headlines nationwide due to his affairs with 2 older adult women. (ie. He was so irresistible, that he was a danger to women everywhere) Eventually being taken to court by the local authorities. He was only 15.</p>
<p>Ellsworth 'Sonny' Wisecarver reminisces about a time in his life forty-three years earlier when he was a socially awkward but street smart fifteen year old in 1944. He lived in what he considered a bizarre home life in Los Angeles with his somewhat naive but unusual parents. Like most mid-teen boys, Sonny wanted to meet a nice girl his own age and ultimately fall in love with her. Girls his own age didn't seem to be attracted to him. Instead, he met and romanced in succession two older women: first, twenty-one year old Judy Cusimano (who was already in a common law relationship which had bore two children), and second, twenty-five year old Francine Glatt, whose husband was away at war. After the first highly publicized relationship, Sonny was dubbed "The Woo Woo Kid" by the press. And despite the press resulting from the first relationship after which Sonny vowed not to get involved with an older woman ever again, he met Francine which started the cycle all over again. This press also brought disdain by many, but admiration and love from afar by an abundance of young women and teenyboppers. With this recollection of life in 1944, Sonny just wants to tell the story from his side.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Patrick Dempsey stars as "Sonny Wisecarver" aka the "The Woo-Woo Kid" in this small film which is based on a true story about a teenager in 1944 who has two affairs with older women. Beverly D'Angelo and Talia Balsam are appropriately sexy as the two love interests for Dempsey. All in all the film is a nice way to pass the time. It is one of those hit-and-miss comedies that came a dime a dozen in the 1980s. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
