<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>When four friends accidentally hit and kill a man on a road at night, they start to panic and decide to dump the body into the sea. A year later, they all try to settle down again, but one of the friends receives a note in the post, with the words 'I know what you did last summer'. As each of the friends gains their own reminder, they finally accept the one thing they feared the most; someone knows what happened that night, and now they're out for revenge.</p>

<p>After a nasty accident, four friends begin to drift apart. One year later Julie James gets a anonymous message and then a slicker wearing, hook wielding killer begins to rip apart her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like Kevin Williamson.  Scream was a brilliant parody of horror films while being scary in its own right and Dawson's Creek is a great television show.  But this film is just not that good.  It's not scary.  It's not well written or well thought out.  There really was no reason for guy from Rosanne to get killed.  He had nothing to do with it.  And it is the same thing in the sequel, most of the cast has nothing to do with it either.  I didn't find this flick scary in the least although the story at the beginning was interesting.  It is blessed with a cast of incredibly good looking people but that does not make it a good film to watch.  If you really enjoy seeing Love Hewitt running around with her breasts half exposed, Gellar looking particularly sexy, Phillipe trying to box, Prinze Jr. looking silly, stupid characters that do stupid things, unconvincing deaths, a trunk full of fish that conveniently disappears (smell and all) when it is required to, someone get a hair cut in their sleep without knowing it and a plethora of other really bad scenarios, then this is your movie.  However, if you want to see a good horror flick with teenagers getting killed, rent the early Fridays, the first Halloween, the first Nightmare, the first Texas, the first Evil Dead and even Scream.  But for God sake, stay away from this one.  It is quite bad.</p>
