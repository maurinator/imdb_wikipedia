<p>I usually don't laugh out loud at jerry lewis movies, tho i almost always am entertained by him and appreciate his genius. The errand boy makes me repeatedly laugh out loud and has for almost 45 years. i never tire of the hilarious routines and i think its a shame that jerry was never nominated for his work. as far as I'm concerned, the Jim Carey's and Eddie Murphy's of the world should send jerry a cut of every check they get since they have stolen from him enormously. i usually don't agree with the french, but jerry is a genius and he did his great works with only the special effect of being jerry.The underwater diver scene and the Leo Durocher scene are classics as is the musical boardroom scene which never tires as many times as i have scene Jerry do it on the telathons</p>
