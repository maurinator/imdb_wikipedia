<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is one of the funniest ever.  Adam Sandler, Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi are three incredibly dense would-be rock stars who break into a radio station with a water pistol to get their tape played and try to obtain a record deal.  the stunt causes a lot of media attention, and cheering crowds gather outside the station.  This is not an intellectual film, but it is very funny with all three of the main cast playing very different characters.  Brendan Fraser is honourable, Adam Sandler is so dumb he attracts women who feel a bit sorry for him and Steve Buscemi is his older brother who brandishes the gun.  If you want an hour and a half of pure light entertainment, watch this!</p>
