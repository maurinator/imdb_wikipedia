<h1>Farewell My Concubine (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>"Farewell, My Concubine" is a movie with two parallel, intertwined stories. It is the story of two performers in the Beijing Opera, stage brothers, and the woman who comes between them. At the same time, it attempts to do no less than squeeze the entire political history of China in the twentieth century into a three-hour time-frame.</p>
<p>China, 1924. Prostitute Yanhong sees no other alternative than leaving her shy son Douzi behind at a training school for Chinese opera. Shitou, an older boy, takes pity on Douzi and he needs it because master Guan rules his school with an iron fist. The boys are beaten, tortured for forgetting their lines, so put to the test mentally that suicide sometimes is the only option left. Douzi and Shitou become friends and are talented, destined to be great actors, they impress audiences by performing together. Douzi however wants more from the friendship, but Shitou doesn't answer his advances. The situation becomes worse when the courtesan Juxian manipulates Shitou in rescuing her from the brothel House of Blossoms and marrying her. Through the years, with the political situation in China ever changing and not always for the good, Shitou and Douzi remain close, but will it ever be like old times?</p>
<p>The story of two men, who met as apprentices in the Peking Opera, and stayed friends for over 50 years.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>quote by tedg: "Opening scenes are seductions, promises. They transport one to the world of the story and establish who you as viewer can expect to be. Done right, they are an art to themselves. This film's opening is among the best I've seen, establishing the world of performance: politics as theater and love as both. It lets you know the perspective is centered on a stylized stage and concerns loss, sexually ambiguous brotherhood and betrayal. All in a couple minutes."Well put. Also noteworthy is that at the end of the movie the opening scene is being mirrored (the two actors on stage being lit by a spot light), the film thus coming full circle. Quite ingenious.What is good about the movie is that we (Westerners that is) learn a lot about recent Chinese history, which cannot be a bad thing considering the direction in which China is heading.Oh, and Leslie Cheung's - may he rest in peace - performance is simply outstanding. But then, the acting is first rate all round.This is one hell of a movie.And, off topic, I have once again realised that the problem with sub-titled films is that one misses so much/too much of the actual acting, making it really necessary to view movies twice. Still, (a lot) better than viewing dubbed films though.</p>
