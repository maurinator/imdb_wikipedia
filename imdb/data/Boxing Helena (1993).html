<p>A top surgeon is besotted with a beautiful woman who once ditched him. Unable to come to terms with life without her, he tries to convince her that they need each other. She has other ideas, but an horrific accident leaves her at his mercy. The plot is bizarre and perhaps sick at times, ending abruptly and with a twist.</p>
<p>Doctor Nick Cavanaugh is a successful surgeon, who lives with his colleague Anne Garret. She intends to get married with him. Nick is obsessed by the tramp Helena, with whom he had some kind of shallow relationship in the past. Nick tries to get close to Helena again and one day, he convinces her to go to his home, to get her address book back. Helena discusses with Nick, and is hit by a car in front of Nick's mansion. When Helena wakes up, she is without both legs and abducted by Nick. Nick is taking care of her at his home. She tries to escape, and like a Venus of Milo, Nick removes her two arms, and keeps her hold to a wheelchair. A surprising end finishes the story.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My recommendation is to ignore the negative comments and see it for yourself. Ignore the artsy-fartsy crowd whose dislike, one feels, has more to do with the bad press and criticism by the liberal crowd than it has to do with the film's actual merits. I make no pretence to artsy film credentials, and I'm not a big fan of David Lynch, though v enjoy most of his work, bizarre as it is. However, I think his daughter did a respectable job, especially for the first time out. Some of the symbolism was a bit obvious, but I suspect that made the symbolism more accessible to the average viewer and not just the snooty film buffs. As far as the inconsistencies the critics love to point out -- big deal. The whole "Rosebud" schtick in Citizen Kane was ludicrous and silly, but let's at least allow the same literary license to others.I thought Sands and Fenn did superb jobs, and I thought the direction and music was far better than average.  I enjoyed the movie enough to see it three times so far, and my opinion hasn't changed. I also believe the "trick ending" was essential to the movie and not just some shabby trick. Without it, it's just a gross slasher film and not a think-piece. There's a lot of unpleasant truth about male-female relationships in this film, and Lynch brought it out very well.</p>
