<h1>The Hunger (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Egyptian vampire lady Miriam subsists upon the blood of her lovers. In return the guys or girls don't age... until Miriam has enough of them. Unfortunately that's currently the case with John, so his life expectancy is below 24 hours. Desperately he seeks help from the famous Dr. Sarah Roberts. She doesn't really belive his story, but becomes curious and contacts Miriam ... and gets caught in her ban, too.</p>
<p>Scientist and physician Dr. Sarah Roberts is conducting research on blood and the role it plays in those suffering from premature and accelerated aging. In her very public work, she is approached by among others a seductively beautiful blond woman who attends one of Sarah's book signings, and John Blaylock, who claims he has just started suffering from advanced aging. She initially believes John is the next in a long line of crackpots she's encountered, that is until she sees how much he has aged in the few hours he has waited to speak to her. It isn't until she goes looking for John after the fact that she finds out that the blond woman is Miriam Blaylock, John's wife. What Sarah does not know is that Miriam is a vampire queen, she who promises eternal youth and life to who started as her mortal lovers as she injects them with her blood with her bite. John is the latest in those lovers, he who has been with her for centuries. Her promise, however, is not altogether true as her lovers do end up aging exponentially once she discards them from her favor, after which they are doomed to an eternity of human life in an always aging and decrepit body. Sarah returns to the Blaylock home both in her want to investigate further John's situation, but also in her mutual attraction to Miriam. As such, she may end up the next in the long line of Miriam's vampire lovers who will also eventually be doomed to a life of eternal aging.</p>
<p>Miriam Blaylock is the last of a race of vampires who has lived for thousands of years, feeding off the blood of unsuspecting victims. To quell her loneliness she promises her lovers everlasting life by injecting them with her extraordinary blood. What she doesn't tell them is that they won't live forever, and will eventually start to age rapidly, suffering a painful eternal undead state. When her current lover, John, begins to show signs of ageing, Miriam seeks the help of a Scientist (Sarah) who believes she has discovered the secret of eternal youth. As John rapidly falls into a state of eternal undeath, Miriam seduces Sarah and infects her with her own blood.</p>
<p>Miriam, a centuries-old vampire, preys on urban clubgoers with her vampire lover John. When John suddenly ages and wastes away, Miriam casts her spell upon Sarah, a doctor who researches premature aging. This neo-Gothic exercise in style and atmosphere is perhaps most widely known for a lesbian sex scene involving Miriam and Sarah, played by Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon.</p>
<p>A love triangle develops between a beautiful yet dangerous vampire, her cellist companion, and a gerontologist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film with lots of style, beautifully shot, almost like a dream. This must be Tony Scott's best film to date, why do you ask? The director shows vision, not only in its visual medium but the editing, the music, the production design, the classical costumes and the chance to work with some talent.David Bowie is very good, almost perfect for his part and Catherine steals the whole film. Susan Sarandon is also very good, the infamous Lesbian scenes are highly erotic and also very artistic.This film isn't your usual Vamp movie, the film adds depth to these so-called Vampires.The film probably required a bit more plot but nevertheless, this is all about style, this film looks fantastic.Do not watch this in pan and scan, make sure you see it in widescreen because the director and cinematographer make full use of the panavision width.</p>
