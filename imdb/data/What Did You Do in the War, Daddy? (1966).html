<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the annals of military history are some of the most serious moments imaginable. However, with this movie, surprisingly written by William Peter Blatty that's the farthest thing from director Blake Edwards's mind. The movie is called " What did you do in the War, Daddy? " From the moment an audience sit's to watch this extraordinary movie, a roller coaster ride of hilarity begins. It's the story of Lionel Cash (Dick Shawn) a seriously dedicated West Point Captain who's been ordered to take an Italian town, by the commanding General (Carroll O'Conner). Entering the small town, he is confronted by Captain Oppo (Sergio Fantoni) the Italian commander who immediately surrenders. However, when Cash attempts to order the Italians out, they balk and demand a Festival as a condition. With a real confrontation threatening to renew the war, Cash's Lieutenant (James Coburn) asks, 'what's the harm?' Thus, this film swings into it's comedic mode and the world war turns upside down. Jovality and a festive atmosphere make this movie a fun feature to watch with almost every changing situation causing humor, hilarity and side-splitting laughter. The cast which includes Aldo Ray, Giovanna Ralli and Henry Morgan do a marvelous job to create a superb Classic. A great film recommended to anyone seeking humor in World War II. ****</p>
