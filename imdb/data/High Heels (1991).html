<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like a multilayered cake, filled with delicious flavors and rainbow colors that satisfy the palate and the eyes, this film is so round and perfect that it's impossible to think it could have been better.I saw it when it came out and tonight I saw it again for the second time, the impression was as fresh and fulfilling as the first time around. The acting of both Marisa Paredes and Victoria Abril are true tour de force performances, something to be seen to believe it, although everybody in this film is picture perfect. The cinematography, the editing, the acting, the sets, the music and the wardrobe, all top drawer.There are not as many humorous scenes here as in other Almodovar films, but they are as accomplished as any he has done before, and it must be very unfortunate for non Spanish speaking audiences because most of the humor is spoken, something totally untranslatable in subtitles, and that is something palpably noticed when reading some of the other reviews, that missed completely the totally Spanish flavor and humor.Marisa Paredes must have been something out of this world as a young woman because even here, in some close ups the perfection of her features are breathtaking and as an actress I'm convinced she must be one of the great ones, just incredible.Bibi Andersen (the tallest woman in the jail scenes) was at the time the best known female impersonator in Spain and he/she looks really stunning with a figure that any woman would gladly kill to have.I adore Almodovar film making, so to me this is his best film ever, but then I think the same about all the rest of his cinematography.</p>
