<h1>Slipstream (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the near future, where Earth has been devastated by natural disasters, and giant winds rule the planet, bounty hunter Matt kidnaps a murderer out of the hands of two police officers, planning to get the bounty himself. These in turn try to hunt the two men down.</p>
<p>In the future, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods) have ravaged Earth, leaving a world where pockets of communities live within canyons while a violent wind known as the "slipsteam" is the only means of transport, via airplanes. Matt Owens is a nomadic adventurer who kidnaps a prisoner ("Byron") of two violent law officers so he can claim the bounty for himself. Traveling across the wind swept landscape, Matt and Byron are relentlessly pursued by the officers, and Matt finds Byron isn't what he appears to be, as they travel from community to community and encounter pockets of strange societies that live beyond the slipstream.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To read some comments on this movie you'd think it was a 1989 version of The Avengers (ie, really bad). I saw it at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on the first (and probably only week) of release. With good stereo and in the right surroundings I thought it was a great, highly different vision of the future. Yes, there was a lot of Mad Max in there and okay some of the visual effects were a little ropey, but it did at least boast two of my fave actors - the late, great Bob Peck and a pre-Titanic Bill Paxton. The 10 years since it was made has seen scant screenings on British TV or otherwise. A pity as there are some great moments such as the scene where Paxton attempts to rescue Peck from a kite (I kid you not) and the moody finale which was intriguing. On the whole, well made, erratic entertainment that loses everything on the small screen but features some interesting ideas, even if not all of it works. And compared to The Avengers, it looks like the greatest movie ever made.</p>
