<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really can't think of much in this movie that was funny.  Chris Kattan had a couple of moments that were amusing, but that was almost at the end of the movie, and it was also interrupted by the incredibly dreadful organ donor doctors.  A lot of the other "jokes" are of the 'look how clever' I am sort. Maybe they are trying to spoof all the bad cartoons on Comedy Central by showing how bad a cartoon really can be.  There is even a reference to South Park, namely monkeybone supposedly being funnier than South Park.  That is the best joke in the whole movie.</p>
