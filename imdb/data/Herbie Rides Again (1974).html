<h1>Herbie Rides Again (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alonzo Hawk is a mean-spirited property developer who has bought several blocks of land in the downtown district in order to build a gigantic shopping mall. There is one problem however; an elderly widow named Steinmetz won't sell the one remaining lot that Hawk needs to proceed with his scheme. So he resorts to all manner of chicanery, legal or otherwise, to get it. Fortunately, the widow Steinmetz has an ace up her sleeve in the form of Herbie, the miraculous Volkswagen.</p>
<p>The living Volkswagen Beetle helps an old lady protect her home from a corrupt developer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Herbie the Volkswagon is one of my childhood favorites and this is the movie I discovered Him.Seeing this movie again, I ended up loving it all over again and think it is a pretty good family movie.A weird thing about this movie is that even though it was filmed in 1973, it looks like it was made in the mid sixties. I guess it was Stephanie Powers's character's sense of style and the heavy use of sets and rear projection.The Volkswagon beatle has always had a persona to it and the Herbie movies highlight it."The Love Bug" and "Herbie Rides Again" are great examples of the child like spirit of Disney at their best.</p>
