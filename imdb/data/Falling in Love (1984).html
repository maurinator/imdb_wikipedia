<h1>Falling in Love (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During shopping for Christmas, Frank and Molly run into each other. This fleeting short moment will start to change their lives, when they recognize each other months later in the train home and have a good time together. Although both are married and Frank has two little kids, they meet more and more often, their friendship becoming the most precious thing in their lives.</p>
<p>Molly, (Meryl Streep) is a beautiful housewife who is married to a doctor and lives in upstate NY. While out Christmas shopping she accidentally gets her packages mixed up in a Manhattan bookstore with a handsome young man named Frank (Rober De Niro). Frank is a married architect with two young children who also lives upstate. Months later they take the same train into NYC and bump into each other again. There is an instant attraction between them but neither of them is looking for an affair. They keep bumping into each other and having longer conversations. They are both falling in love against their better judgments. Honest with each other about not looking for an extramarital affair, they cannot resist seeing each other, just to talk. Their emotions grow stronger and they cannot stop thinking about each other. Although they remain chaste throughout, they confess their emotional betrayals to their spouses independently. When Frank tells his wife about meeting this woman on the train but confirms that he has never slept with her. His wife replies, "No, this is worse!" The final outcomes are Molly and Frank separating from their spouses, and each other. This movie accurately portrays the angst, humor, and confusion of two people involuntarily submitting to something more powerful than themselves - falling in love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've read reviews and articles from its day dismissing this moving as a waster of two major talents. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, all of those comments appear short sighted if not just inaccurate. True, the film is an "hommage" to David Lean's "Brief Encounter" and I don't think anybody can deny that. The word "hommage" may be arguable but the concept isn't it. Streep is a feast to the eyes and ears. She was then and she is now. She constructs something memorable out something quite ordinary. De Niro falls into place but it's hard to divorce him from his well established film persona. Is this Travis? So clean? I fell into their Brief Encounter situation head on and enjoyed it thoroughly. In particular the first 45 minutes when their lives are starting to connect but before the actual connection. My favorite part? Meryl for the first time waiting for him in the train, looking out of the window to catch a glimpse. The juxtaposition of her thoughts it's dizzying, wonderful and worth the entire film.</p>
