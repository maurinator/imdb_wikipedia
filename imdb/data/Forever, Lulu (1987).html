<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Enjoyed this film about a girl named Elaine, (Hanna Schyqulla) whose luck in life seems to be going down hill. Elaine wants to be a writer and she works during the day for a company that makes toilet seats and in the evening she writes her books. Elaine one day is late for work and she loses her job and has fallen behind in the rent and is being evicted from her apartment in a rough section of New York City. Elaine is also looking for an elusive woman named LuLu (Deborah Harry) and they keep running across each others path. Unfortunately, Elaine gets herself mixed up with murder, robbery, drugs and two attach√© cases full of money, plus a full length mink coat and the mafia is also very interested in her whereabouts. This film has plenty of comedy, some nudity and plenty to keep you interested right to the very end of this film. Enjoy</p>
