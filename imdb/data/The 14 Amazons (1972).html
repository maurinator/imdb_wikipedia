<h1>The 14 Amazons (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The cast of The 14 Amazons is a veritable "who's who" of the golden age of Shaw Brothers swordplay adventures, and was not only a major box office hit (ranking 4th for 1972), but also a top prize winner, including Best Support Actress for Lisa Lu, a special citation for outstanding lead female performance for Lily Ho, Best Director for Cheng Kang, and an award for Honorable Mention for Drama.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"As the saying goes, 'A tiger may be old, but it never gives up it's ambition.'"The 14 women of a family seek revenge for their treacherously murdered husband/father/brother/son/nephew/grandson in this old-school martial arts flick. Their forces are outnumbered and their enemy is vicious, but the women of The 14 Amazons (great title, by the way) are totally bent on vengeance and protecting their country from the bloodthirsty ruler of West Hsia and his 5 sons. Watch it for the impressive large scale battles and several really cool scenes (human pyramid/bridge FTW!) Who doesn't like to see a bunch of women being crafty, heroic bad***es? The camera work during the battles is great, and the movie as a whole is surprisingly gory, violent, and occasionally hilarious, too. Even the frequently used miniature sets and models are very well done (though they are understandably noticeable to today's viewer). A great job is done making several members of the large cast memorable (my personal favorite is Yang Pa Mei). Plus, the enemy soldiers all wear uniforms that make them look like Santa Claus, which is just pure bonus win. Any Shaw Brothers fans will have a grand ole time with this one. It's one of my favorites that I've seen. </p>
