<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An American oil company executive of Swedish descent, now living in Sweden, is blackmailed into spying for the Allies during World War II. At first resentful, his relationship with a beautiful German Allied agent causes him to realize how vital his work is. When he learns that his anti-Nazi German associates are under suspicion from the Gestapo, he risks his own life to go back inside Nazi Germany to finish his work and try to save his friends. It's an exciting story with great characters, filmed partly in the locations where the story took place.</p>
<p>Blacklisted in modern day WW2, a Swedish oil trader opts to assist British Allies, by means of infiltrating and surveying Nazi Germany.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wanted to set the record straight on 1 of the reviewer's retelling of one of the most important scenes. I call this scene the epiphanny scene, because William Holden's entire perspective changes after hearing Lilli Palmer's reasons why she has become a spy (Palmer)"He (Hitler) is the anti-Christ and I am a Christian". (Holden): But your religion also tells you to love your enemy!" (Palmer): I said I was a Christian, not a saint!. .... (Palmer again)"You businessmen are all alike, thinking this war is one grand chess match. Try to think of it as one small truck going off to a concentration camp and those who are shivering inside." (Holden) "I feel for those people" (Palmer)"Yes, but not WITH them, that's the difference. But someday you might. You'll see a man, a complete stranger being bullied and beaten and in that instant, he'll become your brother" (Holden)" I don't know if you are wise or just foolish, but your husband, (who cheated on her) must be an idiot"</p>
