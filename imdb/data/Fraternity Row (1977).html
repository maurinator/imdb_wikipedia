<h1>Fraternity Row (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Story of an upper class college in the early '50s and how a "harmless" hazing resulted in a student's death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a valuable teaching tool for anyone working with fraternity systems in Colleges and Universities.I saw it on TV while I was a College student. I eventually worked in Higher Education for over 20 years and for a long time wished I had a copy to use for Greek in-service education. A few years ago I was able to purchase a copy on ebay. I received a document which attests that Fraternity Row is a public domain movie.The narration is smooth and focused. The acting, centered and honest. While it can be looked on as time capsule body of work the relevance of this true story still resonates with college students today.</p>
