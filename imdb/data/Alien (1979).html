<h1>Alien (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A commercial crew aboard the deep space towing vessel, Nostromo is on its way home when they pick up an SOS warning from a distant moon. What they don't know is that the SOS warning is not like any other ordinary warning call. Picking up the signal, the crew realize that they are not alone on the spaceship when an alien stowaway is on the cargo ship.</p>
<p>With their intention being to respond to a SOS call they recieved from an unknown moon, the crew of a commercial spaceship decide to search the mentioned moon for intelligent life; when they run into a completley different, bizarre form of being. The alien soon starts hunting and terminating the terrified crew, one man at a time.</p>
<p>In this who-dies-next gem, a deep-space mining crew is awaken from hyper sleep to investigate a distress beacon. The source is a derelict spacecraft where one of the crew members is attacked by an unknown life form. Ignoring the quarantine rules, the science officer allows the infected crew member to be brought on board, and the rest of the crew must deal with the consequences.</p>
<p>When commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, heading back to Earth (in future year 2122), intercepts an SoS signal from a nearby moon, the crew are under obligation to investigate. After a bad landing on the moon, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not realize the danger they are in.</p>
<p>In the near future, during its return to the earth, a commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress SOS from a distant moon. The seven-member crew are woken up from the hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the moon. While exploring the moon, a three-member team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside it containing thousands of eggs. When a curious team member goes too near the egg the parasite inside the egg attacks him, rendering him unconscious. He is brought back aboard, the spaceship takes off. After a little while the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled. Everything returns back to normal - but not for long.</p>
<p>While returning from a deep-space mission, the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo is awakened by a supposed SOS call from a system they are passing through. Descending to the moon's surface, they discover a strange derelict spaceship - the apparent source of the transmission - and one of the crew descends into the hold. What he finds are thousands of strange alien eggs. While examining one of the eggs, it hatches and the parasite inside attacks him. After returning to the Nostromo the crew takes off again to head for Earth. The alien parasite subsequently dies and all seems well again. But what no one knows is that another alien is quietly forming within its host - and when it emerges, the crew finds itself in serious trouble.</p>
<p>After a space merchant vessel perceives an unknown transmission as distress call, their landing on the source moon finds one of the crew attacked by a mysterious lifeform. Continuing their journey back to Earth with the attacked crew having recovered and the critter deceased, they soon realize that its life cycle has merely begun.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will  always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining.  Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood  and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an  interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing  about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings  strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score.  Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as  well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !</p>
