<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A gem of a caper movie, based on Donald (HOT ROCK)Westlake's novel. I discovered this film in the bargain bin of some video outlet near Ft. Bragg, NC. I was a little homesick at the time, not having had leave for nearly a year, and I thought I could alleviate some of the pain by kicking back with a few beers and watching a NY-set Seventies flick. Boy, what a find. This is a real sleeper, with easy-going charm provided by the two leads (Gorman and Bologna), suspense, droll wit, and a fine performance by J.P. Ryan as the treacherous mob fence. The film perfectly captures the mood of NYC in the early Seventies, seen through the eyes of its ethnic, blue-collar inhabitants. Catchy title tune by Michel Legrand, gorgeous location photography by David L. Quaid, cameos by Joe Spinell, Frankie Gio, and Frank Adonis. A completely satisfying conclusion. This film will leave you with a smile on your face for hours after each viewing.</p>
