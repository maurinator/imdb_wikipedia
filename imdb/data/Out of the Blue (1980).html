<h1>Out of the Blue (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young girl whose father is an ex-convict and whose mother is a junkie finds it difficult to conform and tries to find comfort in a quirky combination of Elvis and the punk scene.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Don't be fooled by the negative reviews. This is definitely worth watching. Linda Manz is INCREDIBLE! Come on! She was in Gummo!!! (She was also in The Wanderers and played a similar tomboy-Jackie Earle in drag (sorta) character). She gets the job done and well is all I'm trying to say. But Dennis Hopper gives an amazing performance as usual in all his psycho glory and the dude who plays Charlie is slimy as hell (good thing){note: I didn't remember it was Don Gordon who also played a sleazy dude in The Mack}. Plus Neil Young songs. What else do you need? My videotape copy has the worst quality of a commercially released video that I've ever been witness to, but I see that the great folks at Anchor Bay have released this on DVD. I'll be buying it soon. You should too.</p>
