<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Charming comedy about the fate that intervenes in the lives of Jack, a swinging 81 year old bachelor who has everything but youth, and his grandson David, who change souls after a freak accident. Burns is lovely, but it is Schlatter who steals the picture with a witty and youthful version of Burns.</p>
