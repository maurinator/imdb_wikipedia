<h1>The Man Who Sued God (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Billy Connolly plays Steve Myers, a lawyer who became a fisherman from frustration. When his one piece of property, his boat, is struck by lightning and destroyed he is denied insurance money because it was 'an act of God'. He re-registers as a lawyer and sues the insurance company and the church under the guise of God, defending himself. The accident leads him to a friendship and eventual relationship with a journalist, Anna Redmond (Davis).</p>
<p>Advocate Steve Myers is disillusioned with the lies and deception he experiences in Court and decides to quit. He invests money in a small yacht and goes off sailing. Then one day he wakes up to find his yacht has been struck by lightning and totaled. He informs his insurance company, who review and then subsequently decline his claim on the grounds that they are not liable as his yacht was destroyed due to an 'Act of God'. With no money to finance another yacht, Steve dramatically files a claim against God, naming the Pope and the local Bishop as representatives of God, and thereby the respondents. The Pope, the Bishop, their respective lawyers, as well as their insurance company get together to find a way to settle this dilemma, which does catch the fancy of the media. It is in Court that God's representatives will have to admit that Steve's yacht was actually His Act, accept it, and compensate him, or deny it altogether, and thereby deny His existence, and leave the onus on Steve to prove his claim.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The story's an excellent one.  A fisherman see his boat get hit by lightning, but the  insurance company won't pay up as they call it an "Act Of God", so he decides to sue  God - well the leaders of the churches, anyway.I wish Billy Connolly would play less roles where he's called upon to be Billy Connolly,  where there's no at all the swearing and being Scottish - he can be a really good actor,  and he sort of is in this.  Judy Davis, however, isn't convincing, but I'm sure that's the  fault of the role or the writing, rather than Ms Davis herself.At first thought, the ending seems to be very Hollywood, but in the time since I saw the  film, it would appear that perhaps it was the best possible conclusion.  The two other  possible endings - one would have been even more Hollywood and the other one would  have been a disappointment.(And on a minor point, I think this was the first time I've ever seen a movie or TV show  set in Sydney that didn't go for the stock cliche of shots of the Harbour Bridge and/or  the Opera House - kudos to the writers for not being formulaic in that respect).</p>
