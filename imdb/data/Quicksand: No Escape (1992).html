<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Animal House" stars Tim Matheson (also the voice of Jonny Quest) and Donald Sutherland. Matheson is a workaholic architect whose partner's decision to bribe a city official to get a contract explodes in his face. Sutherland plays the sleazy private detective hired by Matheson's wife to trail him and instead witnesses a crooked vice cop's attempt to shake the architect down. He decides to take advantage of the situation and frames Matheson for the murder of the vice cop--but holds onto all the incriminating evidence so he can blackmail the innocent architect into either paying him $100,000 or performing a hit for him. The film as a whole is just okay, but I always like Matheson in movies, and here is no exception. You kind of wish he could cut lose and play a little comedy, but this is just not that kind of movie. Sutherland steals the show as the bad guy and has one great moment where it sounds like he's promoting his son's show, saying: "24, 24, 24!" years before the show came on the air.</p>
