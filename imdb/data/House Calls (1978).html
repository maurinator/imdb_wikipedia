<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A great, small, simple comedy that works because of the terrific cast.  And it's not only Glenda Jackson and Walter Matthau but Art Carney and Richard Benjamin.  And the story actually works because all the characters are involved.  There isn't any arbitrary stories.  Matthau meets Jackson because she's made to wear a ridiculous head bandage provided by Carney and Matthau removes it and performs surgery on her.  Carney becomes angry/upset over this and blackmails Matthau into supporting him for Chief Resident even though Carney's obviously "crack pot".  Jackson and Matthau become lovers but she eventually becomes angry with him for (among other things) not standing up to Carney.  That's what makes this an almost perfect film comedy: the characters, plot and situations all seem to spring naturally from the events in the plot.  There's nothing forced.  And the actors seem to be having a ball.Matthau and Jackson are superb together.</p>
