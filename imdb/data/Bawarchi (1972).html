<h2> Summaries </h2>

Then one day a young man named Raghu offers to work as a cook, and he is hired. Raghu quickly gets a grip on his job and on each of the family members, and soon the squabbles and arguments come to an end. And then the Sharmas find the family jewels and Raghu missing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you have low tolerance for Bollywood, and you think Bollywood is just all about cheesy, loud and lewd movies, than it means that you are not aware of the rare gems the Indian film industry has produced in the last 50 something years. And this film is one of such gems. I haven't seen, "Anand" the most popular film of Rishida, but I have seen Bawaichi 3 times and every time it leaves me with the sad reality that how come the Western world has not discovered movies like this. The film revolves around the relationship of a family and their new cook, played superbly by Rajesh Khanna. I don't want to go much into the details of the story of the film and cinamatic mastery of Rishida, but in short this film could be described as excellent in every aspect. If you are a fan of Indian 'art' films, than this a must see for you!</p>
