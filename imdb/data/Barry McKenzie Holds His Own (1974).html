<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A top notch film great cast, great songs, and the ever loveable Bazza doing what he does best being Bazza, this time his Aunty Edna gets kidnapped by a ratbag vampire Count Eric Von Plasma, so Bazza and his mates have to go rescue her, great characters, including mates like Scrotum Baker. Edna is outstanding as usual, her home movies are classic.Just as good in my book as the first film, with great lines great songs great acting. A bonzer film no risk if you haven't seen this ripper of a film you don't know what you're missing out on. My equal favourite film of all time (other on is Adv. Barry Mckenzie)</p>
