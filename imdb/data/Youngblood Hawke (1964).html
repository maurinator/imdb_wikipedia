<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>James Franciscus was perfectly cast in the title role of Youngblood Hawke. he was a excellent intense actor who always gave his all. fact is he was handsome and very talented who should have became a major star and this film should have given him the success he deserved. Franciscus commands the film along with great dramatic scenes with Genevieve Page. don't know why the film was poorly received and why his critics on here make false comments about him and his acting. if you wanna see a good soap opera story with attractive leads, then watch this film. i liked it and it keeps your interest. the film is loosely based on Thomas Wolfe from a novel by Herman Wouk.</p>
