<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>World War II is over but Captain Willoby and his men must "occupy" remote Midi Island. The men are disgusted at not going home...until they meet the friendly island women. Unfortunately, Willoby has been ordered to prohibit his men from "fraternizing." This task, already frustrating, is made worse by the presence of missionary's niece Diana and the arrival of gorgeous journalist Angela. Meanwhile, the island king has presented Willoby with equally gorgeous Rozouila as "wife"...</p>
<p>Captain Bill Willoughby, U. S. Army officer serving as the Military Governor of a lush, South-Pacific island, following Word War II, has the duty of seeing that none of the American troops fraternizes with the beautiful---or even ugly---Island girls. His duties become a bit complicated when the native chief presents him with Rouzuila as his hand maiden, who immediately falls in love with him. Willoughby loves Diana Forrester, the island missionary's niece, and things get even more complicated when Angela Toland, a newspaper correspondent arrives and falls for him to.</p>
<p>War-weary Captain Willoby and his men are the occupation force on an island of lovely women...and are forbidden to fraternize.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, it isn't a masterpiece, but this forgotten little movie does have some something to offer. It's got three of the loveliest ladies working in movies at the time, and you get to see them in Technicolor! While it would have been nice to have a few more musical numbers for these talented women to sing, there are some good musical moments. Gloria DeHaven has a rendition of "All Of Me" that steams up the screen as much as anything Marilyn Monroe ever did, without being over the top. The title song only gets a brief treatment that makes you wonder why they didn't feature it as a full number. There are some funny scenes as the captain tries uncomfortably to avoid entanglements with these lovely ladies. The movie would have benefited from more location shooting to make the tropical island atmosphere more realistic, but they probably had a pretty limited budget. If you enjoy lighthearted musicals and service comedies, give this one a chance if you can catch it on Fox Movie Channel.</p>
