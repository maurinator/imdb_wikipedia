<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this movie when I was in college and man could I relate. I'm 30 now and recently saw it for the first time since then when I watched it a billion times. I won't pretend that it has passed the test of time with flying colors, but it does what it sets out to do extremely well and without a lot of bells and whistles.Synopsis: 3 fellas from upper crust families play grown-up from an early age and have varying results as they enter adulthood. Drama ensues. Resolution meets some better than others. I really enjoy the Steve Parlavecchio kid and will, after concluding this review, seek out his career accomplishments, if he had any.Also of note, I believe this was the first substantive role for Mira Sorvino. I assume that without daddy Paul blazing trails for her, she never would have gotten much farther than this flick.Perhaps most important: A KILLER soundtrack for any child of the late 80's/early 90's with solid score by Ennio Morricone. I will never forget finding the soundtrack in a Used bin for $1.99 back in '95.This is the polar extreme of a GoodFellas/Godfather epic in the same vein. Take it for what it is, and I say you'll really enjoy it.</p>
