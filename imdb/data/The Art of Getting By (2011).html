<h1>The Art of Getting By (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Believing the quote that you are born alone, die alone and everything else is an illusion, George doesn't see the point of life, school, or homework. Then he meets Sally and he now has a reason to go to school and make friends, even if he's not ready to admit to himself or to her that he likes her. The school's principal and art teacher introduce him to an alumni, and successful artist, Dustin, who can help guide George along life's path, but other distractions start surfacing, and George might not even be able to graduate from high school.</p>
<p>George, a lonely and fatalistic teen who has made it all the way to his senior year without ever having done a real day of work, is befriended by Sally, a popular but complicated girl who recognizes in him a kindred spirit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gavin Wiesen's first full length feature is a NY indie with a couple of great young actors, great NY locations, but a standard boy meets girl story.George Zinavoy (Freddie Highmore) is a loner and apathetic. He is failing his year having done nothing the whole year. He's in danger of expulsion unless he can do all the work. Sally is popular but complicated. She is an MPDG. They cut class together. She treats him like a kid, but is there more? Freddie Highmore has that look of weak kid. Emma Roberts has one great cruel manipulative emotionally vicious scene. The ending wraps up too well. It's a good first time effort for Gavin.</p>
