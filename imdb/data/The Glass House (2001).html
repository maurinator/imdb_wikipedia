<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As much as I like me some Sobieski, especially when wearing a bikini as she does here, I cannot recommend The Glass House as anything other than a mildly entertaining yet instantly forgettable piece of trash; it certainly doesn't work as a taut psychological thriller as intended, the far-fetched nature of the scenario draining any tension from proceedings.Lovely Leelee plays Ruby, the oldest of two siblings who go to live with new guardians, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Diane Lane), after their parents die in a car crash. As time passes, Ruby begins to suspect that her parents' wreck was not an accident, but that they were actually murdered by Terry in order to get his hands on the children's $4m trust fund.A hackneyed plot loaded with implausible situations and predictable outcomes ensures that The Glass House never achieves the edge-of-the-seat atmosphere it aims for. As the film approaches its final act, the level of preposterousness goes off the chart, Terry becoming an indestructible killing machine who survives certain death to return for one more attempt at killing meddling teenager Ruby.Still, Sobieski does look mighty fine in that swimsuit...</p>
