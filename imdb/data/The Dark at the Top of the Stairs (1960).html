<h1>The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Oklahoma in the 1920s, Ruben Flood loses his job as a traveling salesman, when the company goes bankrupt. This adds to his worries at home. His wife Cora is frigid because of trying to make ends meet. His teenage daughter Reenie is afraid of going out on dates, but eventually makes friends with a troubled Jewish boy Sammy, and his son is a mama's boy. He finally storms out of the house when Cora falsely accuses him of having an affair with Mavis Pruitt.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm known as a soft touch when it comes to the films I enjoy but this movie also touched and affected my two teenage sons who accidentally were caught up in it while I was watching it. It is very poignant especially the religious prejudice and the pain & destruction it caused.  This is a tasteful story of first love, love lost and love re-discovered.  The characters are wonderful. I hope to have an opportunity to tape it or even better to purchase it.</p>
