<h1>Press for Time (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Norman is quite happy selling newspapers outside Westminster station but his Grandfather (the Prime Minister) wants to get him "a more responsible job". A few favours are called in and Norman becomes the newest reporter at the seaside town of Tinmouth. After causing chaos at a local council meeting and causing the demolition of a new house he tries to organise a beauty pageant. A slapstick tale of corruption in high and low places.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to say I really like Norman Wisdom, I love his wide-eyed innocence the most. Press for Time is not my absolute favourite of his comedy films, but I still really enjoyed it. Wisdom while very funny and charming, like the film itself, doesn't always have the innocence that makes him so endearing here, however some of his antics are very, very funny. I also have to mention Stanley Unwin, he was hilarious here and almost gave Wisdom a run for his money. The script and sight gags are well above average and genuinely amusing, and Press for Time bounces along nicely. It also has lovely locations, nice music, an interesting story and a sweet message. Overall, Press for Time isn't a favourite but I did enjoy it very much. 8/10 Bethany Cox</p>
