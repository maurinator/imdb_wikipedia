<h1>The Wild Life (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eighties teen romp involving Bill and his new apartment, Jim and his rebellious antics, Tom and his crazy self, and Anita with her older man David.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fast Times it ain't.  But check this movie out, it has a heart.  Pour yourself a drink and enjoy.  It's loaded with a slew of just-beginning stars.  Sherilyn Fenn has her first on-screen credited cameo.  Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc.--they all look so young.  Oh and if you look closely the cop's wife is Nancy Wilson from the rock band Heart.</p>
