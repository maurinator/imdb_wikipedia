<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, the first movie was OK at least due to the "originality".But the second only reinforced the failures of the first film.The moments I got a laugh were so few that I can count them withthe fingers of one hand.The parodies of some movies were great. but they were spoiledfor so many gross jokes about sex and bodily functions, that theWayans ruined the intended effect.I don't know, but the people who likes this bad film, must bepeople either very young or very inexperienced moviegoers,because I can tell you, with my 38 years of moviegoing, that thisopus from the Wayans Bros., is a total waste of time & money.</p>
