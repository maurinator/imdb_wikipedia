<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've noticed that some people who've commented on REAL GENIUS do not appear impressed. This must be either because they lack a sense of humor or simply don't know a good movie when they see one. Val Kilmer is hysterical, the script is filled with clever one-liners. William Atherton is THE ego-meniacle bad guy.  And Chris Knight and Mitch Taylor have a guy named Lazlow living in their closet.  Come on, this film is terrific. I could watch this film every day. It's that good.</p>
