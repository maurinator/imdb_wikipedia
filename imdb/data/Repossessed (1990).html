<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one major disappointing and occasionally even downright insufferable horror-parody. Ironically enough, the funniest aspects about "Repossessed" are the trivia details behind it. Apparently the initial screening tests didn't fail just once, but twice! At first the script contained almost exclusively jokes and typical situations referring to the 1973 horror landmark "The Exorcist" but, being released no less than 17 years overdue, a large part of the target audience was too young to already have seen that film and hence didn't comprehend the humor. Subsequently, entire parts of the script got replaced with more general and contemporary 80's comedy (for example: an extended sequence set inside a fitness center with guru Jake Steinfeld) in order to appeal more to younger viewers, but it still failed because  well, the movie simply isn't funny! Writer/director Bob Logan's only remotely praiseworthy accomplishment was that he (or at least his producers) managed to trap Linda Blair into playing a mocking version of the one role that made her world famous. But even that you have to put into perspective, as Blair was probably so tired of getting typecast that she considered a comical part her last resort to get rid of her 'that-Exorcist-girl' reputation. Leslie Nielsen, with his almost naturally comical charisma, narrates the events of "Repossessed" in front of a class of college students. The films opens with a flashback of Nancy's first exorcism in 1973, but then jumps forward 17 years in time, when she's a married woman with two annoying brat-children. Via the TV-set, the devil takes possession of her body and yet again she spurts gooey green stuff all over her beloved ones. Father Mayii is reluctant to perform another exorcism because of his heart condition, so Nancy relies on the inexperienced young priest Father Brophy and a couple of power-hungry Televangelists that don't even believe in demonic possession. There aren't any truly laugh-out-loud moments in "Repossessed" at all. If you're lucky, you might briefly chuckle once or twice but the majority of jokes are just plain embarrassing. There are numerous lame literal jokes and uninspired puns that'll make you roll your eyes in disbelief. For example, one character says: "The word on the street says that your career is history" and at the same moment the camera actually shows a piece of street with the words "your career is history" painted on it. Lame! The finale is pitiable and seems to go on forever, especially when the entire cast starts imitating the greatest rock stars of the eighties. Remember the intro of "Scary Movie 2" (which simultaneously is the only worthwhile sequence in the whole film) where James Woods does a wacky 10 minutes re-enactment of "The Exorcist"? Well, it might be crude and vulgar, but that scene is much funnier and more effective as this dud.</p>
