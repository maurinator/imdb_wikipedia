<h1>Casual Sex? (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two girls go away to a holiday resort looking for a change of pace, hoping to meet some nice men for a change. They discover that they can't find the perfect man, and this forces them to reconsider thei attitudes to men in general.</p>
<p>While attending a singles retreat, two female friends-- one promiscuous, the other unlucky with men-- share their philosophies on love, sex, men, and dating in the wake of the 1980s AIDS epidemic.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A mildly amusing sex comedy. Lea Thompson was OK, and Andrew Dice Clay pretty good here. I thought that Victoria Jackson was the real star here, though. She seems to have disappeared since then. I would have liked to have seen more of her. I can only recommend it casually, though.</p>
