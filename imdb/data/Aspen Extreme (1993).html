<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is my new favorite movie, even though I originally saw it long before this review. I popped in the VHS last night during my period of unemployment and simply loved it.Paul Gross played his part with such sensitivity, and a real down-to-earth quality. I totally believed him, and that's all you can ask from an actor. It seems that he was a 33 year old man, playing the part of a man living from ages 25-27. He plays a stud with self-doubt. That's not easy to do, but he pulls it off like a champion.I love Peter Berg. He has done this role more or less before, but that's o.k. He still does it to perfection. He's the everyman. Finola Hughes played a slightly gentler version of the cold-hearted bitch she played in Stayin Alive, opposite John Travolta.The scenery is amazing, and Teri Polo does a more than adequate job of playing the soulful local who hates tourists and materialism.I envied the guys'friendship, their adventure, and the appealing lifestyle of Teri Polo's small town radio D.J.Every actor did a remarkable job of reflecting emotional pain, disappointment, and anguish. I respect that.Check this one out for its' 80s feel, as many reviewers have mentioned, the breathtaking scenery, and the fine performances that came as such genuine surprises. A memorable flick.</p>
