<h1>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alec Leamas, a British spy is sent to East Germany supposedly to defect, but in fact to sow disinformation. As more plot turns appear, Leamas becomes more convinced that his own people see him as just a cog. His struggle back from dehumanization becomes the final focus of the story.</p>
<p>When a fellow British agent is killed at Checkpoint Charlie right before his eyes, Alec Leamas, head of the Berlin station, returns to London headquarters. There his boss, Control, enquires if he is tired, burnt out, ready to come in from the cold. Control suggests that there is a vacancy, a desk job, that might interest him, but Alec declines adamantly. Thus, Control immediately mentions that he has something out of the ordinary in mind for a man called Hans-Dieter Mundt, who in 1959 posed as a member of an East German steel mission.</p>
<p>Alec Leamas is the operative for the British Secret Service overseeing the field agents and their activities in Berlin. Recent activities in the field in Berlin and Alec's long term status in the position make his London based boss, Control, openly wonder if Alec is burnt out and thus needs to come in from the cold to a London based desk job. Alec's deteriorating state of mind is what Control wants the enemies to believe as he asks Alec to do one last job out in the field. Alec is to pretend to become a drunkard due to his disillusionment with the job, working whatever odd desk jobs outside of the inner circle. This change in attitude would make Alec ripe for turning information to the enemies. What Alec is supposed to do is implicate a purely East German spy, Hans-Dieter Mundt, as a double agent to the East Germans, leading to Mundt being murdered by his own, the Brits expecting the one figuratively to pull the trigger being Mundt's second in command, an East German Jew named Fiedler, who hates his boss. Beyond the regular dangers in Alec being found out or Mundt being able to convince his masters of his innocence, Alec faces one initially unintended obstacle, namely his relationship with a woman named Nan Perry. Alec met her during one of those office jobs, she openly a member of the British Communist Party, but one who, in her idealistic state, saw herself as drunkard Alec's savior. Alec wants to keep her out of what is occurring, which may be difficult as both sides, while watching Alec's movements, will see their involvement with each other.</p>
<p>In the 60's, during the Cold War, the operative Alec Leamas loses his last agent in East Berlin when he is shot while crossing the border. Leamas travels to London to meet his Chief Control. They have a meeting and Control asks him to lure the East Germans to make them believe that their agent Mundt is a double agent and use the Jewish agent Fiedler, who is under the command of Mundt and hates him, to expose Mundt to get rid off him. Leamas poses of alcoholic defector without any pension that finds a job in a library. Soon he becomes lover of Nan Perry, who works with him in the library and belongs to the Communist Party. Leamas is arrested for fighting in a store and when he is discharged from jail, an East German agent recruits him and they travel to Netherlands. Then they travel to East Germany where Leamas meets Fiedler that uses his information to accuse Mundt. They go to a tribunal and out of the blue, Mundt's attorney summons a mysterious witness. Who might be this witness?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have unreserved enthusiasm for this film having watched it on many occasions and yet to find a fault. Indeed it only gets better. It is so atmospheric, with Director Martin Ritt, his designers and photographers, all superb. You really feel you are either in a typical 1960's corner shop in London, a prison in East Germany or a communist safe-house in Scandanavia. It has always been my view that once it is established the leading actor in any film is on top form, which certainly applies to Burton and the script is accepted as good, then it is the support actors who determine whether a film is going to reach excellence. The Spy Who Came In from the Cold has an absolutely first-class range of actors at the very top of their profession. The casting is magnificent and each of them has a meaningful part to play in this film, enabling them to bring their own special qualities to every role.The list of talent is endless and includes Claire Bloom playing the naive young communist, Nan, who befriends Leamas, Michael Hordern, Robert Hardy, Sam Wanamaker, Peter Van Eyck who was very good as Hans Dieter Munt, the very sinister head of the East German Secret Police, the brilliant Cyril Cussack and Bernard Lee. My own particular favourite in the film, however, is the excellent Oskar Werner who portrays Fiedler, Deputy to Munt, who despite this and his fanatical belief in communism, is suspected and despised by his own organisation because he is Jewish.But of course it is Burton who is the central part to the film and he plays the downbeat spy, Alec Leamas, to perfection, in what must be one of the best performances of his film career. Burton is Leamas and Leamas is Burton. He is brilliant and I cannot imagine the author of the book, John Le Carre, being anything than very impressed with Burton's interpretation of his character.The film is well worthy of being watched either by those who have not seen it before, or by others who have to appreciate it once again. It is of course from a by-gone era when communism was an ideology followed by millions and opposed by many millions more besides. It was perceived by many as a fight to the death, hence the tension which Martin Ritt and his team magnificently captures.It may well be a film depicting another era but I have no doubt there will be many operators just like Alec Leamas in our modern-day secret service, just as cynical about making a living in the seedy world in which they inhabit. The story comfortably defies the passing of time, while the quality of acting will be appreciated indefinitely such is the very high standard.Michael Dixon, Sunderland, England.</p>
