<h1>College Confidential (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sociology professor Steve McInter is conducting a survey at Collins College about the mores and lifestyles of the young people. Some of the good citizens begin to find exception to his sociological survey when they find out it includes questions about SEX. When reporter Betty Ducayne receives an anonymous tip that the good professor is engaging in corruption of youth, and Steve's past comes up to haunt him, all heck breaks loose.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Herbert Marshall fans are going to be a bit distressed to find their idol sharing the seamy surroundings of Uncle Albert's "College" with the likes of Steve Allen, Conway Twitty and Uncle Al's usual grab-bag of exploitable "names". Usually, the direction at least can be rated as pretty slick in an Albert Zugsmith production, but on this occasion he has directed the movie himself. Instead of rating as reasonably lively, the proceedings here are dull, slow-moving and indeed super-lethargically paced. Production values also seem unusually tight. In addition to flat camera-work, boringly routine film editing, and cheap, clapboard sets, even the songs are dull and desultory. And worst of all, Miss Van Doren reveals little of her customary talent. Alas, even measured by lowly Zugsmith standards, this entry is pretty much of a bore.</p>
