<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wacky send-up of the gas crisis.  This stillborn political farce centers around milk prices driving up gasoline prices.  Just close your eyes and I'm sure you can predict the idiotic Arab gags.The "conscience" of the movie is supposed to be Donald Sutherland as "Nozzle Nick" a helicopter traffic reporter. His 10 minutes on screen negate every good thing Mr. Sutherland has ever done.Everyone who appeared in this one is a bad, bad person.</p>
