<h1>The Road to Wellville (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A madcap portrayal of William Lightbody's stay at the health farm run by cereal king Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. William's wife, Eleanor, has persuaded him to go to Kellogg to have his system cleaned of impurities. Kellogg is very unconventional, and almost barbaric in his treatments.</p>
<p>In Welville, at Battle Creek, eccentric rich Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (a historical figure) runs a stylish health farm for the wealthy, an idea ahead of his time, based on extreme vegetarianism, neither sex, masturbation or even sensual stimulation, but laughing therapy and purging the 'polluted' body, mainly by exercises, often in open air, vicious diet, his invention corn flakes, laxatives, anal yogurt cure, enemas and brutal mechanical cleansing. Eleanor Lightbody drags her sickly, incredulous husband Will along to the therapy; the couple is almost immediately separated and getting horny for more available members of the opposite sex. Kellogs stubbornly willful adopted son (among over 30 kids) George is a filthy embarrassment, paid off just to stay away. Charles Ossining panics when arriving in Battle Creek he finds his aunt's fortune made him partner in the empty shell- health food company Per-fo, not the planned corn-flakes factory; however with a former Welville-employee and George's name they hope to get rich from their own cornflakes brand. When an electric therapy goes fatally wrong and several other patients die, Will's incredulous reluctance turns to panic...</p>
<p>A story about the ins and outs of one unusual health facility in the early 20th century, run by the eccentric Dr. Kellogg.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Battle Creek, Michigan is hometown to me and several generations of my family.  So, maybe I appreciated 'The Road to Wellville' more than most.  After all, anyone living in Battle Creek either works for the Kellogg Company or is close to someone who does.  Kellogg's and Post cereal companies have affected nearly every level of Battle Creek's evolution for 100 years or more.The great cereal boom of the early 1900s is still talked about today. And tales of the legendary Dr. Harvey Kellogg (artfully played by Anthony Hopkins), Seventh Day Adventists, and the famous (or infamous) Battle Creek 'San' are fondly retold by some of the town's elder residents.  The health regimens practiced at the B.C. Sanitarium led to a host of other health-related businesses in Battle Creek which made everything from dubious exercise equipment to nearly tasteless all-veggie soybean burgers.This film is a lively, tongue-in-cheek rendition of the intriguing story about an era when entrepreneurship in the U.S. was at its peak. The cast, featuring Matthew Broderick, John Cusack, Bridget Fonda and Dana Carvey, is excellent and the humor as wacky as it gets.Bon appetit!</p>
