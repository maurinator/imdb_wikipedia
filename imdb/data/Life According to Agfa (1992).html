<h1>Life According to Agfa (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film takes place in Tel Aviv, much of it in a fictitious local pub called Barbie, a satirical nickname for a famous Israeli mental health institution. The pub's name hints at the characters and the events which occur in the pub and which befall its owner (Daliah), the employees and customers. The plot unfolds with a streak of violence which takes a surprising turn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Though I live in London right now as a student, I'm Israeli. This movie is the kind of movie that makes me proud being Israeli. There are not many Israeli movies out there and most of them are boring carbon copies of each other starring the same people- which makes you think you're watching the same movie again and again. This movie is different. It has various interesting characters, and though it's exploring Israeli life, the theme of things is universal and will appeal to everyone. Followed by a nice, but not as good, sequel/prequel ("Electric Blanket Named Moshe, An ") focusing on some of the less important characters. A must see, if you get the chance to see it!</p>
