<h1>A Simple Twist of Fate (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Michael McCann is a man who feels totally betrayed by the world, after his wife revealed to him that their child was not his. A few years after his break-up we find him living alone in a small town. But, everything in his miserable life changes when he adopts a little girl whose mother died outside his house. After several years, the real father returns to claim the girl from Michael, thinking that she will be an advantage for his political career.</p>
<p>When Michael McCann is thrown over by the woman he loves, he becomes something of a misanthrope and a miser, spending all of his spare money on collectible gold coins. Living in the same town is an affluent family with two sons: John and Tanny. Tanny's a wild boy, whom John cannot control, and one night he breaks into McCann's house, and steals the gold and disappears, which nearly confirms McCann's distrust of mankind. But then, a mysterious young woman dies in the snow outside McCann's house, and her small daughter makes her way to McCann's house and into McCann's life and heart. He names her Matilda, and raises her, finding companionship and a new joy in life with his adopted daughter. But the secret of Matilda's birth may tear them apart.</p>
<p>His life was emotionally closed off from the world, until an orphaned baby showed up at his house.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recently read the novel 'Silas Marner' whilst on holiday having heard that A Simple Twist... was a reworking of the book. I have to say that the book was good but in this instance the film was better.Steve Martin has that hang dog look anyway and his visual expressionism is superb. The warmth and feeling that come across in the film is truly moving whilst Byrne playing the cold hearted millionaire stops it from becoming mushy. I would certainly recommend viewing of this film.</p>
