<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A pair of 60's hippies fall in love with the girl next door, who is exactly the kind of square that they are fighting against.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sandy Duncan exchanges verbal jabs with Susman and Roberts in a film that doesn't much other than urge a weak grin on the viewers face. The dialogue is over done, marginally self referencing, and dated. It felt like Neil Simon was trying to stick with the times as American culture was transforming, but wound up dating himself.It's not a bad film as such, but showcases a kind of self indulgent nature by the theatre elite who want more to show their abilities for the sake of it. Not a bad aim, but it does get somewhat tiring.I think one of the key things about this film is that there isn't too much umph. And it could be because Simon is slightly out of his element here, writing about a place he wants to be part of, but is wholly unfamiliar with. Ergo we get quick witted Southern California characters with New York sensibilities, when their social extraction is Manhattan beach, and not Manhattan itself.Still, it has a certain charm, even if the characters are reluctant fish out of water via Simon's writing. Southern California doesn't bother with lots of well educated verbiage loaded with political references, but more rather how life can be easier, and is not to be taken too seriously. So it is with the LA metroplex with lots of petty desires and image seeking. So it is that Simon misses the mark with this play set in such a milieu, and so it is that Star Spangled Girl remains an interesting experiment.See it once.</p>
