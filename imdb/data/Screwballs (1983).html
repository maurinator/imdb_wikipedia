<h1>Screwballs (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Starting a new tradition of sex comedy, T & A High School, five boys meet in the detention room thanks to the evil virgin princess Purity Busch. RICK - dressed as a doctor and gave breast exams to the high school new comers. BRENT - sexually teased Purity in French class. MELVIN - caught masturbating in the meat locker. HOWIE - rearranged the mirrors in order to see up the skirts of cheerleaders after practice. And TIM - tricked into entering the girls washroom. Each one fooled by Purity, they want revenge. Each one makes a pact to deflower the virgin, but all have failed. Their only chance is to work together with others of the school to get her at the homecoming game.</p>
<p>Frolicking youth comedy about zany high school students set in the 1960s.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film will definitely cause you to rewind a few times, and fast-forward a lot more, because huge sections of it are predictable and flat to the point of humorless. The four main male characters... I hated them, but they seem to be somewhat accurate. Rafal Zielinski is a competent director, and the editor has rendered some rather effective "speed up" gags. Here and there, a good line is said, or a good piece of physical comedy is shown, but it's usually the script, not the way it's delivered, that's funny. And most of the nudity... To be frank, you get sick of it by sheer repetition (Wow, EVERY character is sort a deviant... boring) and want to see a character you can actually like. Now, on to Linda Shayne,She's hardly a prolific director these days, and some of her material is borderline vomitably kid-oriented(Flying Ryan, Purple People Eater), but she is still skilled at suiting the needs of the right target audience. Plus, she is more attractive than the rest of the female cast combined. It's a shame that she couldn't have gotten herself the female lead as Purity: her acting skills and physique are much better. Much more likely to draw a guy like me over to the cause of feminism than Ann Coulter or Oprah WinfreyIn short, she's the reason I am really mad that the local movie rental has lost its copy of this tape.</p>
