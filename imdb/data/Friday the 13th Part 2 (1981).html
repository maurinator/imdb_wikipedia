<h1>Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After killing Mrs. Voorhees, who was avenging her son Jason's death, Alice Hardy can finally sigh with relief. But there is just one problem. Jason never drowned at Camp Crystal Lake and lived in the nearby woods as a hermit all this time. The day that Alice beheaded his mother, Jason saw everything and his heart filled with thirst for revenge. Two months later, Alice gets stabbed by an ice pick in the temple and disappears. Is Jason behind this? Five years later, a camp next do to Camp Crystal Lake is built and the counselors start snooping around the old, abandoned camp ruins. This makes Jason very upset, since his shack is next to the remains of Camp Crystal Lake and what is inside the shack shall be kept secret forever, even if it means killing nine people!</p>
<p>Two months later, after the tragic incidents back in 1979, the only survivor was mysteriously murdered. Five years later, Paul Holt opens a counselor training center, at Packanack Lodge, near by the old Camp Crystal Lake. Ignoring once again the warnings from Crazy Ralph, murders began again. But as the legend goes, did Jason really drown at Camp Crystal Lake, or he didn't? Is there a reason why these murders are happening? Prepare yourself for another night of screams.</p>
<p>Five years after Mrs. Voorhees is killed, the camp counselor training retreat is plagued by a psychotic person with a bag over his head. One by one, the counselors are killed in gruesome and violent ways. Ginny Field, on the other hand, wants to stay alive and will do anything to do so. Anything involves an ax and a pitchfork maybe.</p>
<p>The movie starts off with the survivor of Part I being killed, and it flashes forward five years to a new camp that has been opened across the lake from the infamous "Camp Blood" (Camp Crystal Lake). This time, the killer is Jason Voorhees, who is in mourning for his mother. Again, the counselors are killed one by one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Voorhees is dead, and Camp Crystal Lake is shut down, but a camp next to the infamous place is stalked by an unknown assailant. Is it Mrs. Voorhees' son Jason, who did not really drown in the lake some 30 years before?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After the brilliant Friday THE 13TH, Hollywood of course got greedy and rushed in a sequel with the help of writer Ron Kurz and director Steve Miner. What they deliver is a good installment and top notch death scenes not surpassing the first, but still shocking.Five years after the events of the first film, the survivor of that horrible day is killed by JASON, the boy believed to be drowned for the last 25 years. So now he's finishing off what mama started. Making sure no one goes to Camp Crsytal Lake. But when a new summer camp is opening up right next to his domain, he decides to kill first and ask questions way later.No the hockey mask dosen't come in folks, and no this is not better than the first one. But this one has a playful mode than one, which at it's time was serious. The acting by Amy Steel and John Furey is more of something to root for, because we do care if THEY do die or not. And JASON performance seem lock on, although KANE HODDER is a saint when he plays JASON. And the death scenes are toned down a bit, but still leaves us with that strange feeling in our stomach. Especially the bit involving a wheelchair, what will just make you say "Now that's just plain wrong."</p>
