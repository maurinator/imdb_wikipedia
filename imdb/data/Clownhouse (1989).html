<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen this movie in years since the last time I rented on a local "Video Centro" (a popular video franchise from MÃ¨xico). The memories I have are blurry but I can say without fear of equivocation, that this was a fairly scary and creepy movie; specially for those who have clownphobia.The premise was pretty good and interesting for a fast paced slasher flick. So three escaped convicts "hide" in a big classy house where three kids are left alone. The atmosphere of the house was truly creepy. Accompained to that, there were also decent death scenes provoked by the convicts.Overall this is an entertaining slasher flick that worths a watch... specially if you have clownphobia.</p>
