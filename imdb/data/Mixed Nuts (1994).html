<h1>Mixed Nuts (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Philip runs a crisis hotline with Catherine and Mrs Munchnik. That's the easy part, now it gets tricky... Stanley loves evicting people and he evicts Philip. Philip loves helping people and he is loved by Catherine. Catherine is loved by Louie who loves writing songs. Chris loves dancing to songs and loves to wear large dresses. Gracie also loves to wear large dresses because she's pregnant. She loves the baby's father, Felix, who loves to paint. That just leaves Mrs. Munchnik who hasn't been loved by anybody in a very long time.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve in Venice Beach, California. A serial strangler is on the loose. A crisis hotline, staffed by three inept counselors, faces eviction. Each of the three is lovelorn. They and their non-profit program need a miracle. Their paths cross those of Gracie and Felix, penniless lovers who are fighting with each other and are about to become parents; Chris, an unhappy man in drag; Louie, their loopy song-writing neighbor; a man walking his dogs; a veterinarian; and, their landlord. A Christmas tree, an elevator, a fruit cake, and a pistol also figure in this night before Christmas. Are any miracles in the offing?</p>
<p>The events focus around a crisis hotline business on one crazy night during the Christmas holidays.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This comedy sports a delightful cast with...well, mixed nuts!  Actually the title comes from the fact that the Steve Martin character's father was hit and killed by a truck loaded with mixed nuts, but we all really know what it's really about.  Martin, Madeline Kahn (we miss you!), and Rob Reiner are very funny here, and some of the younger folks are very funny.  I really thought Adam Sandler more or less made this thing...Basically a story of a crisis-phone answering service manned by folks with neuroses and other generalized problems.  Interwoven are stories of other problem folks.  It all seems to work out in a mad-cap way, and although this isn't the funniest movie, it is still very enjoyable, and worth the rent.  Lonely people at Christmas...and the ones they intend to help...all mixed in like cashews, peanuts, filberts...you get it!  Enjoy.</p>
