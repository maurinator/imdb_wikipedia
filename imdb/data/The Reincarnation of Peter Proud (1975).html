<h1>The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When college professor Peter Proud begins to experience flashbacks from a previous incarnation, he is mysteriously drawn to a place he has never been before but which is troublingly familiar. As if drawn to her by cosmic force, he soon finds himself unwittingly in the company of his previous incarnation's wife. This woman, Marcia Curtis, recognizes in Peter startling characteristics which he shares with her dead husband, Jeff. Even the sound of his voice seems at times to be that of the dead man. Peter becomes romantically drawn to Ann Curtis who is or was his daughter (Jeff and Marcia's daughter). Recognizing the incestuous nature of their relationship, Mrs. Curtis tries to keep the two young people apart. But how? Must she reveal the terrible secret of the final minutes she shared with her husband in order to keep this man from her (their?) daughter?</p>
<p>In California, the college professor Dr. Peter Proud is haunted by a recurring nightmare where he is a man swimming naked in a lake that is hit by a row and murdered by a woman called Marcia. He also feels a pain on the hips. He seeks medical treatment with his colleague psychologist Dr. Samuel Goodman in a laboratory but there is no positive result for the treatment. When Peter sees a town in Massachusetts in a TV show, he decides to travel with his girlfriend Nora Hayes to seek the location. After a couple of days, Nora decides to leave him but Peter continues his search. He arrives at Springfield where he eventually meets the gorgeous Ann Curtis in a club. Soon Peter discovers she is the daughter of the woman of his nightmares Marcia Curtis. Further, he might be the reincarnation of Marcia's husband Jeff Curtis, who died in the 40's in Lake Dream. But Marcia notes that Peter Proud is the reincarnation of her husband while he falls in love with Ann. What will happen to the trio?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite films from the 70's when horror and suspense didn't necessarily mean slasher and gore.There was a comment about about an "illegal copy" of this film on the web from VIDEORETRO. I have looked into it and found out something very enlightening. Just so you know, the film is in the Public Domain and the copyright was never renewed, so it looks like there is a lot of bad blood going around in addition to false allegations.Sadly, it doesn't look like there will ever be a remastered DVD of this rare classic as the demand for the film is altogether too low. So a DVDR will have to do.</p>
