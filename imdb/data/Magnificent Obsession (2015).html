<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>CT CT CT ... this name will ring on and on. I'm from India and when a friend told this doc. is coming out on CT I told, yah that guy who screams at everyone and who swears every sec. Never gonna watch it. But, boy, how wrong I was. This is one heck of a documentary, well taken and show's what kind of man he really is, the experiences he went through, the emotion he has for gym and people, how much he loves his family and kids and grand kids, and most importantly his mom, who made CT who he is today. This is a must watch documentary for anyone who goes in to any sport. The passion this man is having is magnificent. It just makes you get up from your seat and move. I cannot say much with words, but I'm a big time rocky movie and rock johnson fan, but CT is definitely in my list. Thank you CT and the tick tock sound of your heart, may it beat on forever.</p>
