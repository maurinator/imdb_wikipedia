<h1>The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Muppets graduate from college and decide to take their senior revue on the road. They hit the streets of Manhattan trying to sell their show to producers, finally finding one young and idealistic enough to take their show. After several mishaps and much confusion, things begin to come together for them.</p>
<p>After graduating college, the Muppets travel to Manhattan to have someone produce their musical "Manhattan Melodies". When it doesn't happen, the gang splits up. Kermit makes friends with Jenny and Piggy is jealous, thinking that Kermit found a new girl. Now Rowlf is a vet secretary, Fozzie's living in a cave, and Piggy is working at a hotel with her partner, but apparently they get fired and now Piggy lives next door to where Kermit works at Pete's with Jenny. When Jenny and Kermit find producer-in-training Ronny Coleman, he promises to produce their show. The gang returns to Manhattan, but after getting hit by a car in joy, Kermit gets amnesia and now finds work making ads with other frogs. When Kermit is found at Pete's, they try to restore his memory.</p>
<p>Kermit and his friends go to New York to get their musical on Broadway only to find it's a more difficult task than they anticipated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jim Henson's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.</p>
