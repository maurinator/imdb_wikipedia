<h1>Heavy (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Victor is a cook who works in a greasy bar/restaurant owned by his mother, Dolly. It's just the two of them, a waitress named Delores, and a heavy drinking regular, Leo. But things change when Callie, a beautiful college drop-out, shows up as a new waitress and steals Victor's heart. But Victor is too shy to do anything about it, and too self-consciously overweight to dream of winning Callie away from her demanding boyfriend, Jeff. Victor's terrible loneliness overwhelms him when he has to face losing what he loves the most.</p>
<p>The life of an overweight, unhappy cook is changed after a kind, beautiful college drop-out comes to work as a waitress at his and his mother's road-side restaurant.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I feel that this is an emotional, heavy hearted and well acted, film. The story centers around an overweight, maternally dependent short order and pizza cook, at a family run bar and eats, in a small town somewhere in America.  Learning about Victor as he deals with change in his reclusive, maternally dominated life, by the introduction of an outsider, portrayed by Liv Tyler, and the sudden death of his mother is what makes this film so good.  It is not a dark tale, but I feel, one of sadness that is presented through a group of people who in everyone's real lives would just be passed by.  The film makes you feel for this small group of people struggling to make their emotional ends meet in their everyday lives.  The film is well done enough that you feel a desire to know the history of the characters but feel as what you know is enough to emphasize with these characters.</p>
