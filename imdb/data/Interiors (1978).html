<h1>Interiors (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of a very dysfunctional family and what happens when the parents divorce. Eve (Geraldine Page) and Arthur (EG Marshall) are a 60-something couple, recently separated. They have three adult daughters - Renata (Diane Keaton), Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) and Flyn (Kristin Griffith). Renata is a poet and is married to Frederick (Richard Jordan). Joey is (reluctantly) in advertising and is married to Mike (Sam Waterston). Joey is a film and TV actress. Eve is an incredibly negative woman and this has had a toxic effect on her children. This results in stifling, unsupportive relationships and joyless lives.</p>
<p>Homage to Ingmar Bergman in this family drama involving a fashionable Long Island interior designer who tries to impose her overbearing, critical standards on her husband and her three grown daughters. The film is a realistic look at the relationships among one artistically-oriented family; one daughter is a successful writer; the second is looking for an artistic outlet; and the third is an actress. The mother has been deserted by her husband, their father. She thinks and hopes they may reconcile, but she soon learns that he has other thoughts that circle about a new acquaintance, a woman who has had two husbands and is still lively.</p>
<p>Arthur decides to leave his wife Eve. Their three adult daughters Joey, Flyn and Renata must suddenly face up to the disintegration of the family: Eve feels quite helpless but Arthur is reluctant to come back. And the daughters also have some personal problems in their relationship with each other, their spouses and their parents...</p>
<p>A dark story of three sisters (Renata, Joey and Flyn) and their attempts to come to terms, not only with their own lives, but with the divorce of their parents.</p>
<p>Three sisters find their lives spinning out of control in the wake of their parents' sudden, unexpected divorce.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>John Waters said that if this film was made under a Swedish pseudonym, they would of called it a masterpiece. Woody Allen was only able to get a film like this made after he won all those Oscars for Annie Hall. Everyone is great in here and it's nice that there's no soundtrack. This is one of Woody Allen's best films.</p>
