<h1>Treasure of Matecumbe (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In post-Civil War Kentucky, young David Burnie becomes the unexpected heir to the family secret: a map leading to buried treasure on the Florida isle of Matecumbe. The youth, joined by four fellow adventurers, begins his search for the treasure despite deadly interference by his late father's archenemy. The angry threat of a hurricane and the presence of hostile Indians set the mood for the frantic trek to the swampy site - a destination that could provide untold wealth for the searchers...or for their evil pursuers!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, this is the only Disney film to feature the Klu Klux Klan.But, horrible racist morons aside, this film can be very enjoyable if you remember seeing it as a child. I remember my father taking me to see this in the theatre when I was very young, and, now that he's no longer with us, it an opportunity to relive some childhood magic. Even if it's just for a moment.Peter Ustinov is wonderful as always.And the opening theme music is very cheesy but COOL in a silly 70's sort of way.If you enjoy the vibe of Disney films like "Child of Glass", you'll probably dig this one too.</p>
