<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Putnam is a writer and an amateur stargazer with a new home out in the beautiful Arizona desert, which he enjoys with Ellen Fields, his girlfriend and a local schoolteacher. John is not trusted by the people of the small town near where he lives, certainly not by Sheriff Matt Warren, who feels protective of Ellen, and perhaps something more. One night, John and Ellen see a meteorite crash in the desert. John drags his friend, Pete, out of bed to take him over to the crash site in his helicopter. Once there, John climbs down into the crater. Unfortunately, he does so alone, as Pete and Ellen wait for him. John is the only one who sees the spaceship before a landslide covers it. And John is the only one who catches a glimpse of the hideous thing inside. At first John's story seems mad, until some of the townsfolk begin acting strange - as if they aren't really who they seem to be.</p>
<p>On a beautiful evening in Sand Rock, Arizona amateur astronomer John Putnam and his girlfriend Ellen Fields see a fiery ball fall from the sky into the desert. They investigate and John sees a spacecraft of sorts and is convinced something is inside. A rockfall buries the ship before any one else can see it and now no one will believe him. He becomes the butt of local jokes when the newspapers pick up the story and Sheriff Matt Warren thinks he's mad. When two locals, Frank Daylon and his employee George, begin to act strangely John is convinced that they have been taken over by an alien being.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I caught this movie in 2D and b/w, on the AMC channel this Halloween weekend.  Prior to now, I'd never seen nor heard of it.Set in and around a small town in the Arizona desert, it tells the story of an amateur astronomer who was trying to get to the truth behind a large, fiery object that fell to earth in the desert.  Was it a meteroid, as the Army had proclaimed after its investigation, or a crashed space ship? Though he caught a glimpse of the latter, the evidence was buried in a landslide in the crater before anyone else got there.Ray Bradbury's believable story is the now-common question of how we deal with things we don't understand, or are "ugly".I thought it played well, had decent special effects, etc., for a film made for 1950s audiences' sensibilities and movie-watching sophistication.One scene included a shapely, flirty young woman who really had nothing to do with the story.  It wasn't until I heard this was a 3D movie that her presence on screen made any sense.</p>
