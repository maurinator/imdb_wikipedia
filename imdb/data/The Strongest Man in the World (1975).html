<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having seen all of the Dexter Riley films that Disney has put out, I can honestly say that "The Strongest Man in the World" is my favorite.And why not?  Not only does it have Russell in all his youthful exuberance and Flynn as the eternally befuddled Dean Higgins but it also features parts for Eve Arden, Phil Silvers and Cesar Romero as A. J. Arno, the Alonzo Hawk for the '70s.When Russell and his fellow college cronies discover a potion and add it to their favorite breakfast cereal, it gives whoever consumes it super-human strength.  Of course, every unscrupulous character within reach is after it and will go to any lengths necessary (even Chinese acupuncture hypnosis.  You heard me.) to gain their ends.  Wild special effects highlight this film, and as always, Flynn takes his broad, funny role as Higgins and runs with it, showing off the benefits of super-human strength to an amazed Arden and her associates.  It may be set in the '70s but gags like this stand the test of time.  And "The Strongest Man in the World" is still as funny now as it ever was.  What can I say; If it has Joe Flynn in it, I'll watch it.Ten stars.  And one more thing: if you're the dean of a college, never let Kurt Russell borrow your car.</p>
