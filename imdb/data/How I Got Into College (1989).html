<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Savage Steve Holland's films should be considered gems amongst pop culture comedy. How I Got Into College is one shining example of his few too many films. In this clarified and easygoing flick about college stress, it accurately portrays irrational teenage fears with the help of an endearing front-man, Marlon Brown. The humor is quirky and unexpected, but that's a part of what makes it funny. The best part about Holland's humor is that it is always out of this world and always honest at the same time, creating a world that a lot of people are familiar with in their own heads. This movie can be enjoyed by college hopefuls, kids or old fogeys like my grandpa, who loves it. Some highlights include the young Lara Flynn Boyle, Phil Hartman in his prime and SAT ridicule that will make every high school kid breathe more easily.</p>
