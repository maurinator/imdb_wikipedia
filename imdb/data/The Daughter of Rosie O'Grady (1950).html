<h1>The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Patricia O'Grady is the daughter of Irish Vaudeville performer, Rosie O'Grady, and is being raised along with her sisters by her father who believes the Vaudeville life contributed to his wife's early demise. Thus he doesn't want his daughters involved in any way with performing arts, so when she falls for a performer, successful Tony Pastor, their love faces a challenge from dad. As might be expected, there are some complications, but there is finally acceptance and reunion as father and daughter reconcile by the end of the movie. Thirteen songs and eight dances surround the dialog in this comedy/ musical. Film also is the first major role for Debbie Reynolds (Maureen O'Grady).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rosie O'Grady's daughters (Marsha Jones as Katie, June Haver as Patricia, Debbie Reynolds as Maureen) live with their father (James Barton), a former vaudevilian who is still in mourning for their mother and harbouring a grudge against the theatre.Really the interest of the film is in the musical sequences, featuring Haver with co-stars Gordon MacRae and Gene Nelson, but the story, although entertaining in parts, is so slight as to be nonexistent.  It is a pleasant enough way to pass the time, though.</p>
