<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Janki Kapoor (Nutan) and her two sons (Ravi Kapoor and Vicky Kapoor) come from a poor middle class family, and have difficulties making ends meet. To add to this burden, the family has to content with the waywardness of Vicky Kapoor, who is always getting into trouble with the law, and getting into fights. Vicky is determined to get a job overseas Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as he has heard of thousands of Indians making a successful living there. Ravi arranges for his visa and the money to go to Dubai. Once in Dubai, the Kapoors receive no word from him, and eventually give up on him. Vicky has encountered problems in Dubai, as he was cheated out of a job, as he had obtained a visa under false pretences. In order to remain in Dubai, he must work for an international and ruthless smuggler named Rana (Paresh Rawal), and must earn his keep or be turned over to the authorities. Memorable songs: "Chithi aai hai vatan se, chithi aai..."; "Tu kal chala jayega to main kya karunga, tu yaad bahut aayega to main kya karunga..."; "Amiron ki shyam, garibon ke naam...."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As a Bollywood fan I have been collecting and watching Bollywood movies for almost 2 years. I was never a fan but I was introduced to Bollywood movies by a great friend of mine. One day my friend let me have this Sanjay dutt movie called "NAAM" this was my first Sanjay Dutt movie i have ever watched and when I saw this movie Sanjay Dutt became my favorite actor. we all know about Sanjay Dutt and how he has gone through problems but if you really know sanjay dutt and about his personal life and how he has gone through the worse. I could tell by watching this movie and the way sanjay was acting it showed that he is not a bad person. I mean just watch it you can feel the emotions. As far as the movie it was great outstanding performances from each cast. It has this one memorable song called, "Chitte aaye hai" by listening to that song it almost made me cry. i would not like to give a summary of the movie because I would spoil it but I definitely recommend this movie to any reader that is reading this right now to go either rent it or if you are a collector like me grab this copy as keep it in your collection.</p>
