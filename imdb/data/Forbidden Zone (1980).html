<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I very much enjoyed this movie and watch it again and again. What can I say? It's artistic and enjoyable, very much the kind of thing I like in movies. Also the fact of its' bizarre, dark and surreal mood and humour toward the film. It's like David Lynch's take on Betty Boop, that's how good it is! The characters are insane and possibly on drugs, the King is a sex-addicted monster, yet somehow a gentlemen to the woman he loves, one of the characters is well, uh, a transsexual, another character is a frog. I couldn't recommend it more for it is a musical fantasy giving to us by Richard Elfman. Seriously, leave it to the Elfmans' to give us one of the greatest musicals ever!</p>
