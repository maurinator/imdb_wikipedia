<h1>Fire (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ashok runs a family business that sells takeout food that also has a video rental store at the side. Ashok's extended family includes his wife Radha, his brother Jatin, their ailing mother Biji and their manservant Mundu, all living under the same roof. Jatin, at the insistence of Ashok and their mother, Biji, agrees to marry the beautiful Sita in an arranged marriage, although he is actually in love with Julie, a Chinese-Indian. At first glance, you see a happy middle-class family going through the normal paces of everyday life. However, as the layers are slowly peeled back, we find a simmering cauldron of discontent within the family, with almost every family member living a lie. Both marriages in the family turn out to be emotionally empty, without love or passion. While Ashok is an ascetic who has taken a vow of celibacy, Jatin is a handsome ladies' man who is still openly seeing Julie even after his marriage to Sita. Ashok has pledged his total devotion to a religious holy man, a swami, in order to purge his life of worldly desires and temptations. Radha, bound by her sense of duty to her husband, agrees to go along with his wishes. As you can imagine, with both husbands ignoring their spouses' emotional and sexual needs (albeit with reasons that are totally opposite from each other), it is only a matter of time before Radha and Sita look to one another for comfort and to satisfy their own passions. In this environment, it is only natural that Sita and Radha become fast friends, and, in time, much more than that. But their love is not without its share of painful obstacles.</p>
<p>Aged Biji is a widow, who is unable to walk, talk and look after herself, communicates with a bell, lives with two sons, Ashok and his barren wife, Radha, and Jatin, who is in love with a Chinese-Indian, Julie, and a male servant, Mundu. When Julie refuses to marry him as she dislikes joint family life, he is more or less brow-beaten to marry Sita so that she bear a male child to carry on the family name. Ashok has given up on marriage and is now leading a celibate life, has become a follower of a religious leader, Swamiji, and spends all his free time with him. Jatin has not given up on Julie and continues to meet her in his free time. Thus Radha and Sita are left alone most of the time. While Ashok, Radha and Sita run a take-out Punjabi food business, Jatin runs a video store where he rents out porno movies also on the sly. Mundu passes his free time watching some of these porno movies and masturbating, much to Biji's dislike. Then one day Radha surprises Mundu and tells Ashok to fire him. But Mundu knows Radha's secret - a secret that if revealed, will tear the lives of the entire family apart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>one of best movies ever...Fire...it is not much about sociological description of India today...it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops, never becomes...normal...even when...in this sense the movie is almost unique...both leads are of very good quality...the origin of Das as a street performer are pretty obvious...her performance is a superb "cammeo"...but the use of the light...I have look at it and looked at it, again and again...still mind blowing after ages...nothing torrid in the story...rather "pure" way of facing the subject...in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today, a major art work is usually known as a gender film...Fire can stand face to face with Dryer's Jeanne D' Arc or Ichikawa's Biruma no Tategoto or some of the major Kurosawa movies, just to name "some". Wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame.</p>
