<h1>The Right Stuff (2007)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As House starts his search for a new team, an astronaut comes to him for help. She needs to be treated, without NASA finding out it's her. He puts his candidates to the test as they try to find out what's wrong with the patient. As he tries to protect his patient's identity from the hospital/Dr. Cuddy, House spots some members of his old team around the hospital, even though he knows they're working elsewhere now.</p>
<p>House is forced to choose a new staff... and gathers 40 applicants to start narrowing down the field. Meanwhile, an Air Force pilot wants House to treat her secretly so she doesn't ruin her chances of becoming an astronaut.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>THE RIGHT STUFF starts out with House grilling 40 potential staff members on why the late character actor Buddy Ebsen really got sick while filming THE WIZARD OF OZ. But it quickly shifts gears when he is presented with a mystery patient who is undergoing bouts of "hearing" through her eyes, not a good thing in her actual profession as a combat pilot looking to become an astronaut. Familiar character actors Carmen Argenziano and Kal Penn are among the huge cast, and several unfamiliar faces add greatly to the shenanigans. House slowly eliminates doctor after doctor from the group as the episode races by, and by the third episode, we will find he is down to a tight handful. Since almost every actor appearing as part of the original 40 has lines of dialog, and they all must be SAG members to appear on a show like HOUSE, I can just imagine what this "little" episode cost Fox. But it was well worth it. Unlike the season opener, which had too much House and little else, a must-see. Oh, and some faces from the past make guest appearances. But are they real or figments of House's fevered imagination?</p>
