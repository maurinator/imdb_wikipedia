<h1>Last Dance (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Upon taking a new job, young lawyer Rick Hayes is assigned to the clemency case of Cindy Liggett, a woman convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. As Hayes investigates the background for her case, the two begin to form a deep friendship, while all the while the date for her execution draws nearer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the best performances of Sharon Stone, no doubt. Just as in "Year of the Gun", Sharon demonstrates a full familiarity with the cameras giving credibility to the character, very difficult to be interpreted by the high load of emotion. It is surprising to some extent, because Sharon always appears in his films for its incredible beauty, but in this film in which he plays a prisoner on death row, has a unique opportunity to demonstrate their talent and she does it very well. It is a monumental film and can not fail to be seen.Where demanded more of his dramatic talent, Sharon did not disappoint. Just see her also in "Casino" another film in which she appears fine, leveling up to the first team of movie stars and not only for their beauty but for their talent.</p>
