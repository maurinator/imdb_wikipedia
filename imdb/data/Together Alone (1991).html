<h1>Together Alone (1991)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Together Alone" is the affectionate story of two men, Brian and Bryan, who meet in a bar, have sex, fall asleep--then awake to find they have had the exact same dream. What transpires afterwards is a real, intimate discussion on such issues as God, abortion, sexuality, friendship, marriage, AIDS, innocence, soulmates, judgment, Yin, Yang, and other issues. While the storyline is a bit stagnant, the film is so powerful and so touching it aims for a higher purpose than plot--and achieves it. If you can find it, I strongly suggest you watch it!!!</p>
