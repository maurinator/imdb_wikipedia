<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Monty Python used this collection of sketches from their first and second TV series (re-packaged and staged again) to break into the American market.  A gamble, but a successful one.  All the greats are here  Parrot Sketch, Dirty Fork, Hell's Grannies, Fresh Fruit Self Defence, Marriage Guidance  and more besides.  The animated links, specially created for the movie, are funny and well put-together: and new versions of Killer Cars and the story of the Spot are excellent.  In many cases the film versions of the sketches outshine those in the TV series and are more memorable, particularly those which first appeared in series 1.This is a very good introduction to the team and a strong reminder of their early work for the BBC.</p>
