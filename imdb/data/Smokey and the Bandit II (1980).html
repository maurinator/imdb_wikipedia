<h1>Smokey and the Bandit II (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's been a few years since Cletus and the Bandit made their famous 28-hour run to Texas for a few cases of Coors. Bandit is now a washed-up has-been living in the past, until Big Enos and Little Enos make him another offer: Transport a live Elephant across country in 3 days or less.</p>
<p>The Bandit goes on another cross-country run, transporting an elephant from Florida to Texas. And, once again, Sheriff Buford T. Justice is on his tail.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's fairly obvious that Smokey and the Bandit II was filmed directly before (or during) the making of Canonnonball Run.  Obviously they had a lot of well-known faces from the CR movie, and they had them stick around for some S&tB shots, then built a story around them as best they could.  If you look at each of the cameos, you see they have no tie to the storyline, all they have in common is Reynolds and Gleason.  If you want to see a much better Burt Reynolds / Dom Delouis movie, rent CR (it's hokey too, but not quite as bad as this).Movies like this get made all the time, where a very basic plot line is sketched out, and then the rest is filled in as the writers on the set come up with it.  When good ideas get scarce, they try to fill the gaps with gags on a common theme.  But like any good joke, it's only funny when it is at least semi-plausible.  That's what made the original Smokey and the Bandit so much fun.  But S&tB II is just TOO unbelievable to be funny any more. It might appeal to 12 year olds, but the original audience of 16-25 year olds just don't find them funny.All the negativeness of the above aside, S&tB II is still better than part III.  I didn't think it could get worse, but...</p>
