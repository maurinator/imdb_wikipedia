Which this hunters are obsessed with this cruel sport.Directed by Ernest Dickerson (Bones, Bulletproof, Tales from the Crypt Presents:Demon Knight) made an action-packed thriller. This has good performances by the cast with some memorable sequences. This slightly underrated film was an box office disappointment and it was similar theme with John Woo's "Hard Target". Which it was release a year before.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.
