<h1>The Dead (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>None of us ever really know how we affected the world around us until it's too late. The Dead explores that space, focusing on the personal, private, and disturbingly intimate confessions offered by people at a wake -- when they think there is no audience but their own ears and their departed friend. The Dead is what we leave behind.</p>
