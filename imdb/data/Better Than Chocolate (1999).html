<p>Better than chocolate follows a young lesbian named Maggie. Living in Vancouver Maggie works in a book store which sells titles about the lgbt+ community, including guides to safe sex.

However when Maggie's mother and brother come to stay she is forced to decide between living in secret or revealing who she really is. A tale of love, acceptance, loss and pleasure.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was expecting a pleasant bit of romantic fluff, but instead found this movie to be hilarious, hot, poignant and well-acted. The humor is all about the difficulties we face in communicating with each other, fears of coming out, of taking risks. The romantic content is passionate and believable. And the ultraviolet Julie Christie number is not to be missed.</p>
