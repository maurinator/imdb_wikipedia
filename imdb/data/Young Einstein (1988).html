<h1>Young Einstein (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Albert Einstein is the son of a Tasmanian apple farmer, who discovers the secret of splitting the beer atom to put the bubbles back into beer. When Albert travels to Sydney to patent his invention he meets beautiful French scientist Marie Curie, as well as several unscrupulous types who try to take advantage of the naive genius and his invention.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Others have condemned this film as codswallop. If you're one for historical fact, you shouldn't watch it. That doesn't make it a bad film, however. It's one of those films that just to be silly. Albert Einstein is a Tasmanian apple farmer who surfs, E=mc2 is pronounced "Emck" and is used to put the bubbles in beer, and the chef at the mental assylum puts live kittens in a pie (Don't worry, Albert saves them). It's a good movie for watching during a pajama party. The director may be Yahoo Serious, but this movie is anything but.</p>
