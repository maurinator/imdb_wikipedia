<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ford's performance as Warfield anticipated by nearly a decade the western anti-heroes of Sam Peckinpah.  It is a gripping and surprisingly well-produced oater (considering its modest budget).  It really succeeds in evoking the terror of man alone against the wilderness.  The villains - of which there are a number - appear two-dimensional and even sympathetic; e.g., Captain Addis and his men, reduced by massacre and desertion, perform almost heroically in their desperation (watch for Harry Dean Stanton's understated role as a cavalry sergeant).  The Apaches are seen as brutal, but no more so than their white enemies or the surrounding deserts and moutains, which are haughtingly evoked in this first-rate western.   Highly recommended.</p>
