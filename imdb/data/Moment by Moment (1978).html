<h1>Moment by Moment (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>One year after "Saturday Night Fever," John Travolta starred in this love story between a young drifter and an older woman - Lily Tomlin. The characters are savagely portrayed, and the story is set against a backdrop of shrink-riddled and over-privileged society.</p>
<p>A lonely socialite and a young drifter enter into a May-December romance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stupid!  Possibly the dumbest script for a full-budget movie in Hollywood history, and the "chemistry" between Tomlin and Travolta is utterly laughable.  The direction is as clumsy as you are ever likely to see.  Only a pretty lively soundtrack saves it from being my #1 worst movie of all-time.  Feeling charitable, I give it 2/10.</p>
