<h1>White Men Can't Jump (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Billy and Sydney think they're the best basketball hustlers in town, so when they join forces, nothing can stop them, except each other. To add to their problems, Billy owes money and is being chased by a pair of gangster types.</p>
<p>Black and white basketball hustlers join forces to double their chances.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is well-made: it tells a good story, and maintains high production values. The playing-off of different cultures does not really work, but then again that was not central to the story. The hustler being hustled theme could have done with some more Roald Dahl-like wit, but all in all this is an amusing comedy (it does not reach out enough to be considered a dramedy) and a worthy rental for those boring winter evenings.</p>
