<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nathaniel "Cornbread" Hamilton was the black urban dream and a hero to youngsters Wilford Robinson and Earl Carter. Shortly before he would have become the first man from his community to go to college, he demonstrates his scholarship-winning running ability to his friends and admirers in the neighborhood. At the same time, the police are on a manhunt for an armed rapist. They mistake Cornbread for the rapist and shoot him dead in the street. In the aftermath of the community's shattered dream, and in the face of an intimidating police cover-up, Wilford is determined not to betray the memory of his hero.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old is traumatised by the murder of his friend, a star basketball player.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think the label of blaxploitation for this film is quite unfair- it's heartfelt, various Black and White characters are shown as flawed rather than the "us vs. them" mentality of many racially charged films of that era- and you deeply care about what happens to everyone involved. Plus Moses Gunn is as fine an actor as ever set foot on the silver screen. Just thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of low budget feel and some clich√©d moments. I even got choked up at times. Well worth seeing. Additionally, I was quite saddened to find that so many of the cast died relatively young. For a film from the mid 70s, there's an awful lot of actors in this movie no longer with us.</p>
