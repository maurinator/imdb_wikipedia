<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>November of 1985 was the first occasion on which I had the pleasure of seeing "Columbo: Forgotten Lady," the episode during which scenes from "Walking My Baby Back Home" are very prominently shown and add to the charm of the story. As unbelievable as this may sound, I very recently had to opportunity to see the movie "Walking My Baby Back Home" in its entirety--after more than 20 years of curiosity. The movie did not disappoint.Janet Leigh and Donald O'Connor steal the show, with Buddy Hackett an excellent supporting sidekick. Although I must admit that the movie would mean very little to me if I were not such a "Columbo" fan, it is undeniable that "Walking My Baby Back Home" is a treat. I have watched it at least five times already since recently acquiring a copy from an e-bay seller and find it to be very entertaining and relaxing.The movie has excellent musical numbers. The only negative is that the plot seems to be nothing much more than an excuse to lead into singing and dancing, which is fine with me. I wish they would make a lot more movies with the same quality, consideration, and dedication as obviously put forth in "Walking My Baby Back Home."</p>
