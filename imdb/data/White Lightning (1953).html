<h1>White Lightning (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Red Devils, a professional ice hockey team, owned by Jack Monohan (Steve Brodie), is in the midst of a long losing streak, due to bribes being accepted from gamblers by the star player. When the team is joined by cocky Mike Connors (Stanley Clements), a boyhood friend of Jack's, they begin to regain their former winning ways. Mike becomes a star who cannot be stopped, but is disliked by his teammates becuase of his selfish play. Jack tries to keek Mike away from his sister Margaret (Barbara Bestar), who is in love with him, which leads to a bloody fight between the two men. The angry Mike accepts a bribe from gambler Rocky Gilbratar (Lyle Talbot) to throw the big final game. But during the game, an appeal from a young boy who idolizes him, Davey (Duncan Richardson), sets Mike on the right road, and his unselfish play helps win the game.</p>
