<h1>The Wreck of the Mary Deare (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the English Channel John Sands, from a small rescue ship, finds the freighter Mary Deare drifting. Although there's only a little fire, the whole crew seems to have left the ship. John's already looking forward to a large salvage fee, but then he finds first officer Gerald Patch still on board. Sands can't get back to his tug boat and stays with Patch while Patch grounds the Mary Deare. Although he doesn't understand yet what happened on the Mary Deare, Sands allows Patch to persuade him not to talk about what he saw on board and to drag out the official investigation of the incident.</p>
<p>A disgraced merchant marine officer elects to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and, as a result, vindicate his good name.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Really good, sound drama with Gary Cooper and Charleton Heston involving the world of shipping and salvage.  From the raging sea to the eeryness of an empty ship, to the court room and back it maintains a very good pace.</p>
