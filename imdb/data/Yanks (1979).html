<h1>Yanks (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During WWII, the United States set up army bases in Great Britain as part of the war effort. Against their proper sensibilities, many of the Brits don't much like the brash Yanks, especially when it comes to the G.I.s making advances on the lonely British girls, some whose boyfriends are also away for the war. One Yank/Brit relationship that develops is between married John, an Army Captain, and the aristocratic Helen, whose naval husband is away at war. Helen does whatever she needs to support the war effort. Helen loves her husband, but Helen and John are looking for some comfort during the difficult times. Another relationship develops between one of John's charges, Matt, a talented mess hall cook, and Jean. Jean is apprehensive at first about even seeing Matt, who is persistent in his pursuit of her. Jean is in a committed relationship with the kind Ken, her childhood sweetheart who is also away at war. But Jean is attracted to the respect with which Matt treats her. Despite Ken and Jean getting engaged during one of his leaves, Jean and Matt continue to see each other and fall in love. Beyond the issue of Jean's mother's disdain for Yanks and Ken and Jean's engagement, Matt and Jean still have to overcome the differences between the two worlds in which they live. Regardless, the goings-on of the war may override any of their immediate wishes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One great mystery to me is: How different are we from our English cousins? This one helped dissipate the mystery, as it explored the relationships between the officers and enlisted men from the USA, training to invade the mainland in England, circa 1943-44...and the English folks of a rural town.A line I thought my own was expressed in the beginning: At Heathrow, I was accosted by an old distinguished guy, "I say, young lass, you must be a Yank."  "No sir, I'm a southerner." Same was said to a Limey by a sergeant from La.: "And don't call me a Yank. I'm from Monroe, La." Who would have thought we'd be resented (other than for our tardiness in getting into yet another 'war to end all wars'.)? The English respect for tradition was highlighted, as well as their reserve. As that Brit replied to me when I mentioned how polite the Londoners were: "Wish we were more like you: we just sit and suffer in these stifling hot (tube) cars.  You would first try to open it, then you would ask the driver to open the window, and if he didn't, you'd throw a brick through it."Yes, there's that as well as our barbaric treatment of black soldiers, highlighted beautifully by the English ladies hitting the dance floor with the dispirited soldiers after a horrible scene caused by rednecks ganging up on a black soldier.  He had the audacity to dance with a white woman.....jitterbugging, at that.  Wonder what would have happened if they'd been slow-dancing!!!I loved the English scenery. The destroyer/cruiser appearing in front of a flock of sheep was startling (coming up a river).One weakness: the makeup guys ought to make up a dying woman's ENTIRE head and neck, not just the face, with that white stuff.  Certainly detracted from the credibility.Richard Gere was his darling self, and they carefully made this sergeant-cook NOT an intellectual.  He was just an ordinary GI Joe, as was his buddy, the horny sweet eye-talian-American.  Yet  both the Kennedy look-alike captain and the grunts fell into the same anatomy-created trap: they fell in love with the local English women.  I finally understand why there are so many English brides from that era over here.Vanessa Redgrave....does she just like going around nekkid?  Had just seen her in 'Steaming', so this was more of the same but the nuances of her acting are non-paralleled.  I frankly enjoyed the whole movie, as it so interestingly demonstrated a part of that war I knew nothing of.....the interaction of the Brits with the Yanks!!!</p>
