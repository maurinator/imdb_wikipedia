<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie for some laughs, but more importantly it leaves a smile on your face the next day as you think about it. Seeing Broderick's short, stubby, naked body as the kids in the school bus drive by and scream is classic! John C Reilly played a great "Jim" along with his brother "Jim." And the twins, played by Jeffrey Jones, are nigh unto hilarious. The "Evil Twin" has to take over the role of his good twin and become husband, uncle and mayor, and this creates a lot of humorous situations. When they think the twin is drunk in the bar and say that he is "shitfaced," but he was dead, was funny. There are a lot of one-liners that make you crack a smile. Overall, it's a great movie for a relaxing night with friends and popcorn...er, popcorn and friends, whichever you give priority.</p>
