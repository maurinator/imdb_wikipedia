<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wonderful study of the last day in the life of a man. This movie has one specific scene where Alan Leroy  (Maurice Ronet), sitting at a cafe in Paris, takes his first alcoholic drink after months of rehabilitation. This scene is complimented by stunning photography of  Chislain Cloquet and the haunting music of Eric Satie. Malle captures the true meaning of existentialist philosophy and manages to create a movie that does not wallow in self-pity but instead celebrates our ability to choose whether to live or die.</p>
