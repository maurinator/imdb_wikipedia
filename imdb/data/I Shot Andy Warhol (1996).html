<h1>I Shot Andy Warhol (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on the true story of Valerie Solanas who was a 60s radical preaching hatred toward men in her "Scum" manifesto. She wrote a screenplay for a film that she wanted Andy Warhol to produce, but he continued to ignore her. So she shot him. This is Valerie's story.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lily Taylor was astonishingly good as Valerie in I Shot Andy Warhol. She's a versatile and entertaining actress who certainly does not get enough credit.  Stephen Dorf as a transvestite...  who knew?  But he was also incredibly good.  The entire cast does a fantastic job.  It's a thoroughly enjoyable fictionalized chronicle of the emergence of the SCUM Manifesto and the events leading up to the shooting of Andy Warhol, by Taylor's character a paranoid schizophrenic, man-hating, lesbian.  What could be more entertaining than that?</p>
