<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chronicles the fortunes of two actresses in pre-revolutionary China, who are separated by money and politics.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Plot is described in detail by comments from Mr. Howard Schumann, and this is what happened in China when the movie was released in VCD/DVD form about half a century later:This movie was one of those old movie that triggered debates about morality in China nowadays.  What happened more than a half a century ago is reappearing in China now, and the difference is that back then, actresses was forced into the compromising situation by the economic pressure, but currently in China, those actresses who repeat the exactly the same thing depicted in the movie is out of their own free will, there was no factors such as poverty.Conservatives hard line communists in China blamed the decline of morale on westernization, and the counter argument is that the cause is exactly in the communist leadership, with its corruption due to lack of democracy.  The corruption of the leadership caused the public to be desensitized to the decline of morales and this is the true reason why what happened in the movie is repeated now in China.  It is pretty sad that after so much sacrifice for the revolution, things are back to where it all started.</p>
