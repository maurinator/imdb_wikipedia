<h1>All That Jazz (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Choreographing and picking dancers for his current show whilst editing his feature film about a stand-up comedian is getting to Joe Gideon. Without the chemical substances, he would not have the energy to keep up with his girlfriend, his ex-wife, and his special dancing daughter. They attempt to bring him back from the brink, but it's too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. He chain-smokes, uses drugs, sleeps with his dancers and overworks himself into open-heart surgery. Scenes from his past life start to encroach on the present and he becomes increasingly aware of his mortality.</p>
<p>Director/choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid life of Joe Gideon, a womanizing, drug-using dancer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the best musicals ever made, it's a love song to theater and hedonism and all  things Fosse.Roy Schieder does a fantastic job brings Fosse to life, making the charming womanizing  cad unrepentant and lovable at the same time.Jessica Lange as 'the angel of death' is all you'd want from a grim reaper, and more.But the real standout is the vibrant editing and music- long before MTV coopted the fast  and loose cutting styles that make it hard to focus, Fosse put it to good use- he doesn't  just cut for shock value, he cuts WITH the music, creating images that go right into your  inner rythm somehow.  I don't know how he did it, but every film student in the world should study this  masterpiece.Ten out of ten!</p>
