<h1>The Green Wall (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young couple forsakes their urban existence for life in the exciting but dangerous Peruvian jungle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is based on the personal experiences of Armando Robles Godoy who, like the protagonist,  abandoned big city life to "colonize" the Peruvian jungle in the 1960s.   The director's brother, Mario Godoy, was the cinematographer.  Julio Alem√°n, the Mexican actor who plays Godoy, won a prize for this role.  It helps the viewer's understanding of this movie to know that it is based on an episode in the director's life.  Surely it was cathartic for him to have told it.  I hope it brought him closure to this deeply felt tragedy.</p>
