<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was intrigued to learn about George Raft's life so I watched it.I Googled him while I was watching. I learned about him turning down major Warner Brother roles and thought they could have focused on that a little more. It was quite sad that for an actor who did great gangster stuff from the 30's to the 40's that his last great movie was Some Like it Hot where he played a parody of himself and that he was relegated to a greeter at a Havana casino which went down south due to Castro's overthrow of the government. Similar to Hogan's Heroes as far as the wrong era being used for the female actors, Why were behives and long flowing hair as well as sixties style dresses and shoes used? I was so focused on that that the movie was actually distracting.That was the only thing I got out of the movie.</p>
