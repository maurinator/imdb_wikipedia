<h1>One Sings, the Other Doesn't (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The intertwined lives of 2 women in 1970's France, set against the progress of the women's movement in which Agnes Varda was involved. Pomme and Suzanne meet when Pomme helps Suzanne obtain an abortion after a third pregnancy which she cannot afford. They lose contact but meet again ten years later. Pomme has become an unconventional singer, Suzanne a serious community worker - despite the contrast they remain friends and share in the various dramas of each others' lives, in the process affirming their different female identities.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Without being accused of gratuitous nastiness (as rightly prohibited in the IMDb guidelines), can I just say how disappointing, to the point of hostility, I found this film, especially as I think its director's brilliant early work is in  desperate need of re-evaluation.  This film has none of her virtues - the mix of spontaneity with supreme formal control; the contrast between the privileging of heroine's subjectivity and ironic objectivity.Instead, this is a formless, rambling picaresque, using two female friends to chart feminism throughout the 60s and 70s.  Many of the film's arguments seem to me anti-feminist; the songs are largely sub-Joan Baez and intolerable; the lack of any ironic intelligence countering the optimism and platitudes is patronising; and I still can't believe the rather tactless Eurovision-style song about abortion.</p>
