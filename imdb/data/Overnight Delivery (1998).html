<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is a little gem, a straight-to-video film with a heart of gold.Wyatt Trips (Paul Rudd) is still lovingly dating his high school sweetheart, Kim (Christine Taylor). The day before Valentine's Day, he calls her up only to hear about a late night escapade with "The Ricker" from her roommate. Thinking she has cheated on him, he gets extremely upset. His buddies take him to a strip club to cheer him up, where he meets stripper Ivy Miller (Reese Witherspoon). The two team up to write a break up letter, complete with fake used condom and topless picture of them together, to send to Kim, via overnight delivery. However, when Wyatt finds out they he was wrong, he pulls Ivy into a cross-country road trip to get the letter back from an over-achieving delivery man. But could Wyatt end up falling for Ivy instead? (Gee, I wonder) This movie may have some completely insane plot twists and situations that you would just never see, but the stars make it work. Paul Rudd is adorably lovable as Wyatt. He's hilarious and has great physical comedy. Reese Witherspoon gives a perky, funny performance as Ivy. Its one of her more memorable romantic comedy characters.The movie is so under the radar that it is barely known, but it should be. Any lovers of romantic comedies will fall in love with it, and there's even humor of the likes that would keep the guys interested. A heartwarming movie that will make you feel good all over :)</p>
