<h1>I Love You to Death (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joey works with Rosalie in their pizza parlor. She is convinced that he works all of the time for them and her world dissolves when she finds that he has been fooling around for years. Being Catholic, divorce is out of the question, so she and her mother and her best friend decide to kill him. Hopelessly incompetent as killers, they hire incompetent professionals as they beat, poison, and shoot Joey who remains oblivious to their attempts.</p>
<p>In Tacoma, Washington, ethnic Italian Joey Boca and his loving wife, ethnic Slav Rosalie Boca, have two children, own and operate their own successful pizzeria, and own an apartment building which Joey manages. All their customers and tenants seem to love affable Joey... perhaps a little too much as Joey is a chronic philanderer, something of which Rosalie is totally unaware. Things change when Rosalie secretly catches Joey undeniably cheating on her. After she gets over the initial shock and grief which makes her want to kill herself, she instead figures a better idea is to have Joey killed. She decides to confide in her mother, handy woman Nadja who lives with them and has not liked Joey for a long time for taking Rosalie for granted, and Devo Nod, Joey and Rosalie's younger busboy/cleaner at the pizzeria, he who Rosalie knows has always loved her. Unable to do the job to completion, they figure they need some professional help. Who Devo finds to do the job are druggie cousins Harlan and Marlon James, whose interest is solely in the money as they have never killed anyone before. Through the entire proceedings, the truth may set them all free.</p>
<p>Joey owns a pizza parlor, and is married to Rosalee, and is a major womanizer. Rosalee goes to extremes when she finds he has been cheating.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In spite of Kevin Kline's fractured Italian accent, this is one of the funniest movies ever.  It is a true story.  I've seen the couple interviewed on two television programs.....they are exactly as Kevin Kline and Tracy Ullman depicted them.  I have shown this tape to guests and most recently to a large group of seniors. My popularity rate has moved up a notch or two because of choosing this movie.  It's a "feel good and leave you laughing" story.  Well worth a trip and a search at the video store.</p>
