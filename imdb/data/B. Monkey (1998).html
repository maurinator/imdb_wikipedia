<h1>B. Monkey (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alan Furnace is a young man with the perfectly proper, quiet life of a London school teacher. But beneath all of that decency lies a burning desire for excitement and he just found it. She's a woman unlike any other: Unruly Irish eyes, Latin lips... her name is Beatrice, but on the streets they call her B. Monkey. She's about to take him on an outrageous, dangerous and sexy ride through the wild side of London.</p>
<p>Beatrice is a smash-and-grab jewel thief, an Italian in London, robbing with her partner Bruno. She and Bruno live with Paul, who's Bruno's lover and a world-weary cokehead in debt to a local thug. Each of the three loves the others. Beatrice quits the game, Paul and Bruno split, and a primary-school teacher named Alan enters Beatrice's life. He romances her with dinners and a trip to Paris to dance at a jazz club. Paul faces pressure to pay, Bruno wants another score, and Beatrice may not be able to trade the rush of robbery for the quiet life of a teacher's wife. Her entanglements with Paul and Bruno may not be easily cut. And what of Alan: will he fight for love?</p>
<p>A young woman attempts to end her criminal career. But she needs love to make it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"B. Monkey", with Italian diva Argento in the title role, tells of a young female thief who tries to go straight but is haunted by her past from both inside and out. What could have been a better romantic psychodrama stills plays out well as B-flick with good pitted against evil in the usual ways though it stumbles a bit in the end. The film has visceral verve, solid performances, and develops and builds until the climax in the last minutes. Good stuff for mature audiences into Europics with plenty Argento skin.</p>
