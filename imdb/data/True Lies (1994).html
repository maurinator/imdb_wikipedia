<p>Harry Tasker: devoted father, husband, and computer salesman. Or so everyone thinks. In reality, Tasker is a spy in one of the United States government's highest branches. As Tasker continues to keep his profession a secret from his family, his wife, Helen, begins to surreptitiously meet with a used car salesman, Simon. Upon discovering this, Tasker sets out on a personal mission to win his wife back and find out Simon's true motives. Meanwhile, a Middle Eastern terrorist organization known as "Crimson Jihad" is on the rise, threatening nuclear war with the United States if their demands are not met. As the clock winds down, Tasker must not only fight against the bloodthirsty terrorists, but also fight to regain the trust of his family.</p>
<p>Harry Tasker is a secret agent in the Bond style. But his wife Helen and family think he is a computer salesman.

<p>The secret agent Harry Tasker has been happily married with his wife, the legal secretary Helen, for many years living in the suburbs and having a teenager daughter, Dana. Helen does not suspect that Harry has a double life, and she believes he is a computer salesman. After a top-secret mission, Harry finds evidences that Helen is having an affair with Simon, an used cars salesman that seduced Helen with the glamour and excitement of his fake life, telling her that he is a spy. Harry forces his partner Albert Gibson to use the resources of their agency to follow Simon and Helen; they abduct Helen wearing masks and later they assign a pseudo mission for her. However, a group of terrorists kidnap Helen and Harry and the couple gets involved with a dangerous group that possesses an atomic bomb ready to be exploded in Florida.</p>
<p>A fearless, globe-trotting, terrorist-battling secret agent has his life turned upside down when he discovers his wife might be having an affair with a used car salesman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>*** out of ****I've seen True Lies at least four times now, and every time I find myself having a great time watching this first-rate action/comedy/thriller.  But it's a movie that I can't muster more than passable (but occasionally fairly ecstatic) enthusiasm for.  It's a very good action movie, and I can certainly see how it's attained a reputation as one of the best adrenaline-pumping rides of the 90's, but it's not great.What True Lies has is one of the more ingenious action movie premises I've seen.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a husband (to Jamie Lee Curtis) and father (to Eliza Dushku) by day, and world-saving CIA agent by night (or day, it depeneds).  His latest assignment puts him on the case of a mad Islamic terrorist called Aziz, who's retrieved several nuclear warheads and plans to set them off on U.S. soil if his group's demands are not met.  Complicating matters for Harry is the inclusion of his wife, Helen, whom he believes is having an affair with a used car salesman (Bill Paxton, in what's got to be his funniest performance).In terms of pure escapist enjoyment, this is actually James Cameron's most successful film.  True Lies is probably the only Cameron film that never suffers from the slightest hiccup in pacing (yes, Aliens had a slow beginning and viewing The Abyss was like watching molasses sliding down a brick wall).  From beginning to end, there's not a single slow spot, as you can expect either a sharply staged action sequence or comical setpiece around every corner.  To keep such momentum up for 141 minutes is pretty damn amazing, and Cameron must be given credit for making such a long movie almost so effortlessly enjoyable.But for all that is so enjoyable about it, True Lies lacks a strong plot (in terms of action, as the romantic subplot is actually quite excellent).  The villains are stereotypical terrorists, pure cartoons who don't even make an impression as cool villains.  In his heyday, Arnold has battled tons of memorable villains (T-1000 and the Predator stand out), the terrorists here are clearly among the weakest of Arnold's foes to date.The action is suitably over-the-top, especially the harrier jet climax, which makes almost all the action that came before it believable in comparison.  But the action is mostly excellent, the shootouts and fistfights are exciting, there's plenty of cliffhanger thrills, and the chase/catfight set on the lengthy bridge is classic.  The movie has to keep a balance between strong violence and screwball humor, which it pulls off very well.  The half-hour segment devoted entirely to Harry's marital problems is hilarious, its only flaw being the abrupt segue to "typical" Arnold action.  Even when Arnold's taking down massive armies of terrorists, Cameron still maintains the same light tone evident during the comical scenes, while still keeping the action thrilling.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The cast is all excellent, given the material and intent.  Schwarzenegger is still the extremely likeable big lug.  These roles aren't a stretch for him, but he excels at such parts because he radiates charisma like no other actor (even if they may all be better than him when it comes to talent).  As the comic relief, Tom Arnold is surprisingly very funny (since then, it hasn't been so surprising as he's actually provided decent humor in those Andrzej Bartkowiak films, or however you spell the guy's name).  Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful, too, and I've never been a big fan of hers.  Without a doubt, this is easily her most winning performance.One of the big box-office hits of 1994, I was surprised to see True Lies didn't inspire any genuine imitators.  Just as well, I suppose, there's only so much Bond "parody" you can see without the material getting tiresome (Austin Powers, anyone?).  But True Lies' charms lies in that it works as parody while still excelling as a straight action thriller.  When it comes to pure direction, that's proof James Cameron can be a genius.</p>
