<p>this film was filmed in the village i was living in the cotswolds called upper slaughter i was a extra in it,and am looking for a copy of this film for myself without success for many years.my brother and i are clearly seen in this film many times although kids at the time so if anybody knows where a copy is available please let me know This village was used for another film earlier called Joseph Andrews it starred beryl Reid i was a extra in that too but never seen this as it was an over 18 and i was about 7 at the time.The village had all its electric cables put underground for the films.there was a lot of villagers in the film as they took over the school as a makeup room .</p>
