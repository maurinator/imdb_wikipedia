<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>APNA DESH is one of Rajesh Khanna's most successful films when he was in his prime, APNA DESH isn't a melodramatic film but more on current affairs where corrupt people rule. The film is well handled, the film for most of the part is believable though the director does resort to commercial diktats like the entire part of a disguise which worked in 1970s. The climax too is a bit unbelievable and stretched. The film yet is a well made film Direction is superb Music by RD BURMAN is one of it's assets, Duniya Main Logon Ko by RD Burman and Asha is still remembered,the other songs too are good Kishore Kumar's songs for Khanna as always are superbRajesh Khanna underplays his part superbly and mostly refrains from hamming, Mumtaz gets a lesser role but does a superb job Om Prakash is splendid, Madan Puri is superb too, rest are all good Jagdeep provides good laughs</p>
