<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think that Parting Glances is a brilliant film.  One thing I can add to the other comments on this film is to say that I think Parting Glances resonates so strongly with everyone because it is primarily a film about relationships, particularly friendship.  The characters just happen to be gay, even though it spares no details about their lives.  This approach actually gives more integrity and advocacy to the characters' lives.  I can't tell you how refreshing this elevation of tone was to me.  Nick and Michael admit that their short affair quickly turned to friendship.  If you have ever had a real friend, someone you see and understand and who sees and understands you, you will relate to Nick and Michael, no matter what your sexual orientation.  Plus, the texture of the film is so rich -- with scenes funny, touching, sad, biting and complex.I agree with the user comment made by Helena that Bill Sherwood is a great director.  I too was very saddened by his early death.</p>
