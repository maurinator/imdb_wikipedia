<h1>At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Martin and Hazel Quarrier are small-town fundamentalist missionaries sent to the jungles of South America to convert the Indians. Their remote mission was previously run by the Catholics, before the natives murdered them all. They are sent by the pompous Leslie Huben, who runs the missionary effort in the area but who seems more concerned about competing with his Catholic 'rivals' than in the Indians themselves. Hazel is terrified of the Indians while Martin is fascinated. Soon American pilot Lewis Moon joins the Indian tribe but is attracted by Leslie's young wife, Andy. Can the interaction of these characters and cultures, and the advancing bulldozers of civilization, avoid disaster?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm watching it for the third time on TV. I'm glad there are no commercials [with a film of this length it helps to have no interruptions; the narrative is also much easier to follow].It's true that it is not a feel-good movie; but it is profound, illuminating, and with humorous moments. It seems immensely true to human nature in the ways I know it--interpersonal, native & religious. Some characters are a bit too stereotyped, but how long would the movie be if they were drawn more slowly?A comparison: I couldn't watch the movie "The Mission" three times. To me that seemed only painful.The only nudity I had a problem with was Daryl Hannah's--it seemed a bit gratuitous.Great acting in many quarters. The Indians were superb. I liked Tom Berenger better than in any other of his movies. I liked the use of the setting, the camera work, the editing, the soundtrack...I want the DVD!</p>
