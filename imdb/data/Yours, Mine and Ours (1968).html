<h1>Yours, Mine and Ours (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When a widower with 10 children marries a widow with 8, can the 20 of them ever come together as one big happy family? From finding a house big enough for all of them and learning to make 18 school lunches, to coping with a son going off to war and an unexpected addition to the family, Yours, Mine and Ours attempts to blend two families into one and hopes to answer the question Is bigger really better?</p>
<p>With her children, widowed nurse Helen North moves to San Francisco to work at a naval base. There, she meets Naval Officer Frank Beardsley, himself widowed. They are immediately attracted to each other and go on a date. Although they feel their attraction to each other could lead to a more permanent relationship, they decide to call it off when they learn that she has eight children and he has ten. However, Frank's colleague, Naval Officer Darrell Harrison, who also knows Helen, sees the attraction between the two and does whatever he can to push the two together. Despite the obstacles of such a large combined family, and their respective children's dislike of the idea of having a new parent, Helen and Frank decide to get married. They end up having all eighteen of their children living under one roof with them. Together, the children have a "ours" and "theirs" mentality toward their new family unit. The only real bond that immediately emerges is between Helen's adolescent son Philip, who wants so much to be known as a "Beardsley", and Frank's oldest son Mike, who is Philip's protector in navigating through the trials and tribulations of the lives of sixteen other siblings. But things change even more in the household when Mike makes a decision about his future, Frank and Helen make a decision about the children, and when it looks as if there will be an addition to the family, who will not have the burden of being known by any of the other children as one of "them".</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have to admit that I had trouble with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in the leads largely because they both were really too old to play their respective characters (Ball was about 57 at the time and Fonda about 63).  In the end the film is so well done that I forgot about that.  Aside from the film "Please Don't Eat the Daisies", this is probably the best family movie of the 60's. The best thing about the film is the realistic way in which the family blends together.  The usual problems are all there and the way in which Fonda and Ball deal with it is about what one would expect, a certain amount of good intentions, a bit of mistake making, sacrifice, and providing a good deal of love and support. The writing may not be politically correct in this day and age (the scene where Fonda's kids get Ball drunk, Ball spanks one of the boys, and there is also a certain amount of gender stereotyping), but it is this that gives the film its appeal and relatability. As Leonard Maltin points out, look for a some well known faces in the supporting cast.  Tom Bosley as the doctor, Tim Matheson as Mike, a four or five year old Tracey Nelson, Morgan Brittany of Dallas fame, 70's TV staple Ben Murphy as the oldest daughter's boyfriend, and well known child actor Eric Shea who gives an endearing performance as young Philip, the kid that seems the most lost in the big family. All in all Dad Fonda sums the whole thing up when he describes for the oldest daughter (who's being pressured by the boyfriend to have sex) what love is really about and how this family is staying together, "It isn't going to bed with a man that proves that you love him it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab, miserable, wonderful everyday world that counts. I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far, but if we had it to do all over again who would we skip, you?"  And that is exactly what Helen and Frank are doing together, and the kids admire and respect them all the more for it.</p>
