<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ginger Rogers and Dennis Morgan serve on a sequestered jury during a murder trial. The two fall in love, despite his still being married and her separated. Combination courtroom drama and soap opera. The murder trial stuff is okay. Not 12 Angry Men but interesting enough. The soaper part is weak and drags the movie down. Predictable safe ending doesn't help. The selling point is the cast. Rogers and Morgan are both likable. The rest of the jurors are made of a variety of colorful characters. The standouts being Thelma Ritter, Anthony Ross, and Alan Reed (voice of Fred Flintstone). It's watchable enough but nothing special. Avid Ginger fans will appreciate it more than most.</p>
