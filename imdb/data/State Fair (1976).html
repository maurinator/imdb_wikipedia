<h1>State Fair (1976)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved "State Fair" of the 40s, what a movie Rodgers and Hammerstein truly know how to make a movie to delight the audience, it's not only the "Sound of Music" "Oklahoma!" or "The King and I", it's every one they made In the bonus disk of the DVD Special Edition there's this TV pilot of the never even started series. I didn't seen the 30s and the 60s version yet, but I hope it would be better than this 50 minute waste of time. Different characters, different characteristics (names, ages, numbers), different story, and undeniably different quality. There's no chain from the original, I guess the better way to show this to the world was don't even mention "State Fair", like if it was made from the beginning, starting at zero.In my opinion, the project ends when the crew tries to make the connection with the classic, it could have legs to walk if they just named it "County Family" or "Brothers Disguise", what else less than "State Fair", cause it has nothing to do with it The actors are bad, the plot doesn't work and everything goes wrong, don't waste your time and even if you want to, I'm sure you could find a better way to do it.</p>
