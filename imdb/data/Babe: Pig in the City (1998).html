<h1>Babe: Pig in the City (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After Babe's great victory in the shepherding contest, Farmer Arthur Hoggett turns down all offers to make money with his pig's talents. But when he gets hurt severely in the well, his wife has to take up farming. She does her best but cannot meet the bank's requirements, which results in the necessity of getting back to Babe. Soon, Esme Hoggett is sitting in a plane headed for "the" city. There, Babe unwillingly causes deep trouble. He has to stay with Mrs. Hoggett in the only hotel in town that accepts pets. Friendly neighbours send officials who catch all animals from the hotel: Cats, dogs, chimpanzees and many others. Babe, who managed to stay free, decides to help his new friends and gets unexpected help - not only by Ferdinand, who flew all the way to the city.</p>
<p>Babe, fresh from his victory in the sheepherding contest, returns to Farmer Hoggett's farm, but after Farmer Hoggett is injured and unable to work, Babe has to go to the big city to save the farm.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Too much slapstick for my liking. And yet much was too subtlefor kids, too silly for adults. Way too surreal. Innocence,magic, and sheer novelty of the 1st film were inevitably notthere -- and destroyed by the inclusion of far too much of theReal World. Effects sometimes intruded -- don't want to noticewhen a character is a live animal vs. animatronic as much asthis. This didn't happen in the 1st film because it captured me.This one distracted. Overall, they tried too hard.</p>
