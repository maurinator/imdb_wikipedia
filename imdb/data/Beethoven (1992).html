<h1>Beethoven (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Newton family live in their comfortable home, but there seems to something missing. This "hole" is filled by a small puppy, who walks into their home and their lives. Beethoven, as he is named, grows into a giant of a dog... a St Bernard. Doctor Varnick, the local vet has a secret and horrible sideline, which requires lots of dogs for experiments. Beethoven is on the bad doctor's list.</p>
<p>Barely escaping from nefarious dognappers, an adorable puppy named Beethoven adopts the unsuspecting Newton family and promptly grows up into 185 pounds of romping, drooling, disaster-prone St. Bernard! Unfortunately, even after proving his canine credentials to mom and the kids, the heroic hound gets nowhere with uptight dad, George. But when a beastly veterinarian makes Beethoven the target of an unspeakable animal experiment, George becomes the only hope for saving the Newton's furriest family member.</p>
<p>A slobbering St. Bernard becomes the center of attention for a loving family, but must contend with a dog-napping veterinarian and his henchmen.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>20 years after this movie came out and it can still surprise you. I first watched about two or three years ago and I very much liked it. What really surprised me is that even the bad guy, Dr. Varnick, made me laugh. This movie is funny and appropriate for children. It does contain some things that parents might consider inappropriate for children who are very little or who are sensitive. Some material might be frightening, but overall it's a nice movie. It will make you laugh, especially the dog-nappers.The Saint Bernard became the center of attention of the whole family.At the beginning I thought that the family wouldn't accept the dog, but I kept my hopes up. I would recommend this movie to anyone in general.</p>
