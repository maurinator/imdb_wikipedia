<h1>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In this filmed adaption of the long-running musical, we see the story of Joseph, son of Jacob. The favoured son, he is betrayed by his jealous brothers and sold into slavery and driven to Egypt. Though beset with adversity, Joseph perseveres through wit and faith and becomes the governor of Egypt, second only to the Pharaoh. This all the sets the scene for when he meets his brothers who have come to Egypt to purchase food.</p>
<p>The Narrator draws a school audience repeatedly into a very 20th century 'Technicolor' production of the Biblical story. Patriarch Jacob lived happily with his dozen sons, but his favoritism for bright Joseph, symbolized by the gift of a spectacular multi-colored coat, makes his brothers so jealous they end up selling him as a slave and staging his death. He rises in the service of wealthy Potifar, though his adulterous wife is falsely accused and incarcerated. His gift of dream-telling however wins him Pharoah's favor, in charge of planning for the 7 years of penury after 7 good ones he prophesied. When his brothers come to beg for food, it's time for reckoning and nobility.</p>
<p>A humourously musical retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a gem this new version of Joseph is - a sparkling, lively version of the Lloyd-Webber classic. The songs are performed to perfection and the sets and choreography are brilliant. A strong cast of the famous and the not-so famous (the best of whom by far is Maria Friedman, who, as the Narrator, has a wonderful voice and great stage presence) make the production a delight to watch and sing along to! Children and adults alike will adore its great songs, funky choreography, and humour, making it one for all the family. Donny Osmond doesn't half make a good Joseph too (much to my surprise!).</p>
