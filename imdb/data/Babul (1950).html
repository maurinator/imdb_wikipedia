<p>This is the story of two widower fathers in Madhopur. The first one lives a poor lifestyle, and has a daughter by the name of Bela, who he hopes will get married to the new Postmaster, Ashok, who comes from a wealthy family. He is all the more thrilled when he finds out that Ashok is indeed taking more than an average interest in Bela and has even given her some jewelry. The second dad is Jamnadas, the father of Usha, who lives a wealthy lifestyle in a mansion. He would like her to get married to Vinod, the son of Ganga Prasad, but Usha is in love with Ashok. Who will Ashok marry?</p>
<p>Two fathers, one poor and the other rich, hope that a wealthy postmaster weds one of their daughters'.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There was a time in Hindi films history when a good solid music will carry the entire movie to a place in history and Babul is like one of them. The story is very simple - Dilip Kumar, newly appointed post master of a small town ( village ) and stays in his quarters supported by Bela ( the old post man's daughter played superbly by Nargis ). He comes across Usha, daughter of a wealthy person in the same town who engages Dilip Kumar as her music teacher and eventually falls in love with him. The story has been nicely presented with plenty of enchanting songs provided by the maestro Naushad with melodious tunes of Shamshad Begum and Talat Mahmood. Though the movie was made in 1950 - and even the DVD quality is not that great, you will enjoy this masterpiece when you watch it. I have watched it at least six times during last two three years and will watch it may more times in future.</p>
