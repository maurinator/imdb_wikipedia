<h1>Wilder Napalm (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Wilder and Wallace are brothers and pyrokinetics. Ever since childhood they've been able to start fires with their minds but following a tragedy in which they accidentally killed a man, the brothers have grown up very differently. Wilder has become a regular 9-5 workaday joe but Wallace performs his feats with a traveling circus. When the circus comes to Wilder's home town Wallace starts coming on strong to Wilder's wife, Vida who, ironically, is a slight pyromaniac.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite quirky movies. I've seen it several times and always enjoy it. Good storyline and very good cast, especially Arliss Howard and Debra Winger. The fire effects are quite well-done (pardon the expression) also.</p>
