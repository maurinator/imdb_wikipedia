<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ah, where would the world be without corny '80s movies? "Critters" is certainly one of the best examples, portraying a bunch of nasty little space creatures attacking a Midwestern family (it's always gotta be the Midwest, doesn't it?). As this is pure goofiness, they don't waste any time trying to explain anything logically; they get right down to the wackiness, full scale.Anyway, it's one of those movies that you watch with best buds, or while sitting around in your underwear (or both). Don't explain a religious experience, just luxuriate in the silliness. And to think that it was directed by Stephen Herek, who also directed "Mr. Holland's Opus" (as far as I know, those were the only two good movies that he ever did). Starring Dee Wallace-Stone (that's right, ET's mom!), M. Emmet Walsh (of "Midnight Cowboy" fame), Billy Zane (the "Titanic" villain) and Lin Shaye (the "Something About Mary" neighbor). Really cool.</p>
