<h1>Lycanthrope (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Through a deadly rip in the ozone, a blazing sun sears the dying Amazon jungle - but it's the Lycanthrope that's ripping the flesh off a luckless group of scientists at a remote outpost. Government agent Bill Parker heads a commando team sent to investigate the silenced outpost. Tension is palpable as the jungle heat grips the group when Parker discovers that the psychiatrist, Dr. Stein, has brought along his sexy wife, Sheila, who was once Parker's lover. There's no denying Sheila is a beautiful woman with the loyalty of a piranha. Horror upstages sexual tension, however, when the group is confronted by an empty laboratory drenched in human blood. And a body torn to shreds. They soon discover that they, too, are being hunted.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't believe that this film currently has a 4+ rating as it is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen loads of low-budget genre films. As has been pointed out by another reviewer this film has no budget, doesn't even pretend to be set where it says it is, has a very half-assed cop-out explanation for not featuring any of the titular creatures and features some astonishingly bad acting. Worst of all, it's cosmically boring, with endless shots of either the sun or moon, people wandering through "the amazon" or sitting around in rooms spouting terrible dialogue.Everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of this complete waste of time.</p>
