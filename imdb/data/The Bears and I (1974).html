<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man seeking peace and quiet finds himself father to three bears.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of those tattered movies you pick up from the Family 50 cent racks.  Surprisingly good movie.  Music by John Denver and good performance from Chief Dan George.  Also serves as a gentle introduction to concerns about the environment and native issues for younger folks. Strength of the movie is the story-line.</p>
