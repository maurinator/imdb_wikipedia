<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I plowed through the most recent 5 user reviews of this movie, burrowing past the recitations of historical minutiae and the quibbles about its 50 year old (un)special effects, and thought to myself that everyone missed the point.  Yes, the effects are crude -- the film was made in 19-fricking-54, people!  Yes, it gets some of the historical details wrong -- it's entertainment, people!  The real point is that it's a fantastic yarn, told with great skill and excitement.  When I first saw it (as a teen, before Star Wars) I was glued to the screen.  I still am today.  And evidently, I'm not alone because in 1977 a certain geeky film maker from Northern California stole a large portion of Dam Busters, mixed in a heapin' helpin' of Hidden Fortress, and peppered it all with a dash of Laurel & Hardy & Flash Gordon, calling it Star Wars.So I'm giving props where props are due.  Don't miss this classic.</p>
