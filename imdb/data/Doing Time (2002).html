<p>Mermaidman and Barnacleboy IV: Mermaidman and Barnacleboy are eating at the Krusty Krab when Mermaidman accidentally drops his utility belt. SpongeBob finds the belt and can't resist it. He takes it home and tries it on. He plays being Mermaidman for a while and starts touching the buttons. When Patrick comes over he accidentally shrinks him with his laser-shrinking button. When Squidward hears the noise and comes to complain, SpongeBob accidentally shrinks him too. Panicked, he ends up shrinking all of Bikini Bottom. Embarrassed, he has no choice but to go to Mermaidman, confess that he played with the belt and shrank everyone. At least he'll know which button makes everyone big again. But Mermaidman can't remember so SpongeBob ends up shrinking the whole town so everything seems back to normal. Doing Time: During a boating lesson with Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob loses control of his boat and crashes it into a juice truck and a senior citizens home. Mrs. Puff confesses that she is responsible for SpongeBob, so the police throw her in jail. SpongeBob is determined to free his teacher who he feels was wrongfully imprisoned. But Mrs. Puff is having a wonderful time. At last she can relax without having to worry about accompanying SpongeBob on any more harrowing boating lessons ever again-that is until SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into the jail and attempt to break her out.</p>
