<h1>Bandits (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two convicts, one charismatic (Willis) and the other a hypochondriac (Thornton), break out of prison and immediately start a bank robbing spree, kidnapping bank managers, spending the night with their families, then going with the managers in the morning to rob the banks. Using a dim-witted stunt man as their getaway driver and lookout, the three successfully pull off several jobs (even gaining the attention of a television show about American criminals), and become known as "The Sleepover Bandits." Things are going great until the bank managers begin to realize that the robbers are non-violent and therefore no threat to them or their employees, changing the game for the Bandits. To add to the complications, a bored & unhappy housewife (Blanchett) ends up in the hands of the criminals, and begins to have romantic feelings for both Willis and Thornton, causing a sticky love triangle.</p>
<p>Two bank robbers fall in love with the girl they've kidnapped.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fun but no great shakes.  Not the best of Barry Levinson's movies but certainly not the worse either.Billy Bob Thornton is hysterical as Bruce Willis' partner in crime.  Their method of bank robbery is rather considerate, all things considered, and kind of touching.  They visit the bank president the night before and get in with his cooperation.  Why this happens without incident is anyone's guess, but I don't think its supposed to be deep or insightful or anything, and I don't mean that it insults the audience either.Cate Blanchett is along for the ride, eventually.  She doesn't belong with them, or anyone else, but she adds a lot of fun.I'd rate Billy Bob's hypochondriac in this alongside Woody Allen's in "Hannah And Her Sisters".  7/10.</p>
