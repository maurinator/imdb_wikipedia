Jealous of Karen's boyfriend, Egon kidnaps her and carries her to his secret underground lair.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the more obscure works from 60's SF/Horror Cinema has raised its ugly head in the form of SOMETHING WEIRD'S VHS & DVD release (some early copies had tech flaws so beware unscrupulous dealers). Not so much awful as just plain dumb, STING OF DEATH has a few unintended yocks along the way for the "so bad its good" crowd, but is mainly numb and dull more than "fun". On the plus side, the photography and songs (by NEIL SEDAKA!) aren't half-bad, and the ladies are far more attractive than usual for this type of regional exploitation quickie (including DEANA LUND in her debut). But, the musical scoring is lax, the dialogue mostly lame and it has one of the most illogical creature costumes in history! To wit, a none-too-well disguised black wetsuit with a few rubber tentacles and big CLEAR plastic bag on an actor's head! This is the "jellyfish" monster! At first we were ready to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and assume the creature PUT ON the wetsuit before diving into the waters - but no, in the "climactic" sequence the creature transforms before us STRAIGHT INTO THE WETSUIT! And, you gotta laugh when you see the actor's pale white skin emerge from between the bottom leg of the wetsuit and the BLACK RUBBER FINS the "monster" has on!</p>
