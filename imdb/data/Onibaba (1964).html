<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you." NietzscheThe characters in Onibaba dwell in the bottom rung of Maslow's Pyramid. Food, sex, shelter, survival - though not necessarily in that order.Sexuality permeates every frame of this film. It is ever-present along with the oppressive heat and the marshland weeds. The stark black and white cinematography perfectly captures the desolate mood.The score Â– atonal free jazz backed by tribal rhythms - though completely anachronistic works surprisingly well. One of the most fiercely primal depictions of the human condition on celluloid, Onibaba is a hauntingly erotic masterpiece.</p>
