<h1>Any Way the Wind Blows (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sort of a low-budget Short Cuts (1993), set in the Flemish port city of Antwerp on a warm day in June. Natalie, her brother Chouki, her boyfriend Walter and his ex Lara, the gallery keeper Firmin, unhappily married French language teacher Paul Garcin, a couple of party-loving studs from Ghent (another Flemish city) and the weird mister Winterman, independently go about their lives, which have little in common, yet all end up on the same place for a grand party that evening.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A must see film with great dialogues, great music, great acting and a superb atmosphere.In the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of antwerp, they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird (that's how I love them!).I'm not going to say anything else, just go see and enjoy it.</p>
