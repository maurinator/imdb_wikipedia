<h1>Evel Knievel (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Biography of the famed motorcycle daredevil, much of which was filmed in his home town of Butte, Montana. The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life just before a big jump.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is really a fun movie.  I have no idea if any of it remotely resembles the actual life of motorcycle showman Evel Knievel (I doubt it) but that does nothing to detract from the film.  George Hamilton is great as Knievel. Both his performance and the film's script make you care about the character and that alone seperates it from most films.  If you get a chance, watch it.</p>
