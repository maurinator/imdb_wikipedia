<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two experts and veteran film makers, George Romero and Dario Argento, transform two unknown Edgar Allan Poe's stories in a  powerful and authorial cinematography's experience.Argento directs the best episode, about a photographer whose specialty resides in deaths and murders, and who is becoming a psychopath due to the metropolitan brutality that he testifies (and Argento exaggerates in this scenes,as always:the beginning of the film is a truly punch in the stomach).Harvey Keitel is great in this role, the kind of acting that made him famous. Argento uses quick edition, complex and original camera movements (as in the moment in which Keitel kills two detectives), and an extremely gloomy and unpleasant photography to accentuate the morbid climate that permeates most of his films. Even being violent and quite slow, "Two Evil Eyes" will please the horror fans, for being a show of impressive visual.</p>
