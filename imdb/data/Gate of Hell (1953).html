<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow! What an awesome movie. The leading lady was gorgeous, the shots were magnificent, the music was fantastic, and overall, this was a great movie.Although it is in Japanese, and I saw it with subtitles, it is still the best movie I have seen all year.This movie totally held my attention, and delivered everything I could have wanted, but not in the way that I expected. Wow! Easy to see why this movie won an Oscar for best foreign film. I would say that it is as good as any movie I have ever seen. I loved it.If you are looking for something different from a film, give this one a look. You will not be disappointed.Desert-Buddha</p>
