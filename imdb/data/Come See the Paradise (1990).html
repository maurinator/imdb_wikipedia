<h1>Come See the Paradise (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Portraying one of the shadier details of American history, this is the story of Jack McGurn, who comes to Los Angeles in 1936. He gets a job at a movie theatre in Little Tokyo and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Lily Kawamura. When her father finds out, he is fired and forbidden ever to see her again. But together they escape to Seattle. When the war breaks out, the authorities decide that the Japanese immigrants must live in camps like war prisoners.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>During WWII, Japanese Americans are stripped of their property and sent to prison camps in California.  Also seemingly taken away is the family life of an American man and his Japanese soulmate.This is powerful material and COME SEE THE PARADISE does well as a first attempt.  Surely, sooner or later more talented directors will revisit this bit of history and hit a home run.Few movie fans know that STAR TREK's George Takei (Mr. Sulu) lived with his family in these California concentration camps during WWII.  Both his father and grandmother died in them.As ROOTS showed us the reality of slavery in America, as GERONIMO taught us that the taking of the West was an ugly affair devoid of justice, as the DEAR HUNTER told us that the troubles of Vietnam were deeper than reported on the evening news; COME SEE THE PARADISE gives us an imperfect glimps of some of our darkest mistakes of WWII.</p>
