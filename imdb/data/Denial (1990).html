<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wonder if one has to be a certain personality type to really appreciate this movie. It is not at all for those who need fast paced ACTION. If that's your speed, you may not even like this. Very few friends who I've lent this to have liked this.I on the other hand LOVE this movie. Robin Wright knows how to grab your heart and twist and pull at it. She is so vulnerable. So pained by her loss.Anyone who has ever felt the pain of a lost relationship can't help but relate to the feelings and replaying memories. A reminder from her life THEN sends her into a tailspin of mourning and pain, even though Sarah never really seemed to know Julie well.I am an INFP. I would be interested in the personality types of others who love this movie and others by Erin Digman. I think this movie is so different, that it may draw only certain personalities. Those so in touch and sensitive to emotion and the inner workings of their mind.</p>
