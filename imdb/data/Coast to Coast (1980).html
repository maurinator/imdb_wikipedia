<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Madie Levrington is a neurotic, wealthy woman who escapes from a New York mental institution where her unwholesome husband had her committed to avoid the trial of an expensive divorce. She manages by taking her doctor hostage and leaving him behind in an open field, and flees into the night. Madie hitches a ride back to California with Charles Callahan, a moody, debt-ridden truck driver. Madie and Charles eventually fall in love while evading an assortment of villains including a pair of thugs hired by Madie's husband to prevent her from returning to California, and a repo man sent to reclaim Charles' truck.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As an overlooked movie when originally released, this is one of the better films to watch on video.  It is also one of the films that gave HBO and the other movie networks great material to televise.  Coast to Coast is a fun, timeless tale of two people out of their elements, bonding, and making the most of situations in the lighthearted, Hollywood manner everyone wishes could carryover in real life.  This is a fancy feature to view along with Silver Streak and Mother, Jugs, and Speed.  While it never reaches the violence displayed in those two pictures, Coast to Coast is a great flick to watch at home, on a date, or whenever you want to look at a film from the 1970s era.</p>
