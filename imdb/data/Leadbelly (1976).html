<h1>Leadbelly (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The life of Blues and folk singer Huddie Leadbetter, nicknamed Leadbelly is recounted. Covering the good times and bad from his 20s to 40s. Much of that time was spent on chain gangs in the south. Even in prison he became well known for the songs he had composed and sung during and before the time he spent there.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Leadbelly isn't a great movie, but it does a good job of conveying a sense of the man, and the lead performance is very strong.Director Parks doesn't quite carry off the sense of how alien a world the old segregated South was, and the movie has a bit too much of a this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened quality to it, rather than shaping Leadbelly's story to make a great movie.But overall the movie is engaging, entertaining, and educational, and you get a sense of why he was such an influence on today's music.  It's an enormous shame that the Weavers never credited him in "Wasn't that a time."</p>
