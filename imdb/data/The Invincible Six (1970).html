<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stuart Whitman is the glue that holds this thing together. It's a rather loose storyline about an international jewel thief and his compadres who get wrapped up in the concerns of a small peasant village. The beginning seems overly long and a bit confusing -- in part because the sound quality of the VHS tape I acquired wasn't very good. Once they get to the village, events play out in a manner that is more predictable than not, but I wasn't bored. The two women in the film, Elke and the beautiful Iranian actress, really hold their own with this group of rugged men, who take it upon themselves to protect the village from a gang of bandits led by Jim Mitchum. Very few movies from the 1960s ever approach vintage. I doubt this one will because it feels like it was made "on the cheap," but the actors are better than their material so it's worth a look.</p>
