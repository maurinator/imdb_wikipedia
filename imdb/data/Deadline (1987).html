In an attempt to salvage his reputation and save his career, Stevens goes back to find out who set him up and why. However, all three sides in the war try to stop his investigation and his life comes into danger.

He finally gets a breakthrough, when he meets Linda Larsen, a Scandinavian doctor who might be able to take him to the real Abu-Riadd.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's probably fair to say that who ever reviewed this film in the first place was just being irresponsible. Deadline is in no way shape or form a documentary. If it were, maybe that would have made it a little more interesting. The basic premise is, Walken, a journalist amidst a war is set up and fed false information. The information then ends up making national headlines. As the result, 'ace reporter" Don Stevens' reputation is on the line. Stationed in Beirut he has only till the end of the movie to save his reputation and present "good" news. It's kind of confusing, and not much else happens. I found it interesting in that the Palestinians were not portrayed as savage terrorists, like most films from this era but that's about all. Deadline is no "Endless Night" or "Murder Elite" but then again, nothing ever is.Pair Deadline up with Salvador and you might have a hot double feature, maybe just don't play Salvador first.</p>
