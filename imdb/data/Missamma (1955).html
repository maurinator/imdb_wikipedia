<h1>Missamma (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two unemployed college graduates from Madras, Rao and Mary act as if they are a married couple to get a job as school teachers in a small village called Appapuram. The story unfolds into an extremely hilarious comedy as they try to cover up that Mary is a christian. They are assisted in their drama by Devaiah-a friend and ex-beggar in fooling the family they work for.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Comedy at its best. This movie has a masterful cast at their best. I have seen this movie more than 50 times and would never pass a chance to see it again. Missamma is a well written, well acted and well made masterpiece that has to be subtitled and shown to an international audience.</p>
