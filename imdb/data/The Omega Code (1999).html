<h1>The Omega Code (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ancient codes hidden within the Torah reveal the secrets of global events, past (i.e., Hitler, the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf War), present, and future. One man (York) is after the Code, seeking the power to change the world as we know it... for the worse. Another (Van Dien) seeks the truth, risking his life and everything he stands for in order to stop him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If I gauge this film on the story, without accounting for the religious implications, I'd rate it a 7/10.  It's a decent film, but the ending is a bit unexplained to me.  I'm a little surprised it has earned such a low rating, but I imagine it could be considered offensive to some people.I'm not a religious person, but I don't think the antichrist would be so blatant with his identity.  I can't imagine people in the world not rising up to stop such an evil force, much less that many people siding with him.  That is, if they know who/what he is.  I fault this movie on the religious side for that, because the antichrist would come like a sheep in wolves clothes, or so I would think.Still, an interesting concept that seems somewhat based in truth.</p>
