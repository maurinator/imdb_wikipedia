<h1>The Aviator (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A 1920s mail pilot and a rich man's daughter crash-land on a mountain full of hungry wolves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Few people know that Christopher Reeve was also an aviation enthusiast who had his own Beechcraft Baron. And he transferred that enthusiasm to his screen persona, an ex WW1 pilot who, scarred by an incident, goes on to flying mail planes in the early 1920s.Roseanne Arquette played the spoiled rich girl who becomes his first passenger.They crash land in the Nevada mountains and the rest of the movie concerns their survival and both of their personal transformations. If you'd like to get a good idea about the birth of commercial flying I'd recommend the movie.</p>
