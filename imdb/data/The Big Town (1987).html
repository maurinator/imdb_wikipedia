<h1>The Big Town (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It is 1957. J.C. Cullen is a young man from a small town, with a talent for winning at craps, who leaves for the big city to work as a professional gambler. While there, he breaks the bank at a private craps game at the Gem Club, owned by George Cole, and falls in love with two women, one of them Cole's wife. Infuriated, Cole wagers everything on the craps table, including the Gem Club itself, and he and Cullen have it out.</p>
<p>There is an anachronism: The $1 bills depicted are Federal Reserve Notes, which weren't put into circulation until 1963. Furthermore, it appears that the director was aware that in 1957, the phrase "In God We Trust" had not yet become standard on the reverse side of all U.S. currency, because most (if not all) the bills shown are face up. I consider it unrealistic that a bunch of gamblers around a craps table would all have their money face up when thrown onto the table. It appears that those bills are contemporary (i.e., from the era when the film was made), and therefor would have had the phrase on the reverse. The director was apparently not aware that the $1 bills in circulation at that time were nearly all silver certificates.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's 1957. Indiana small town kid J.C. Cullen (Matt Dillon) wins the local craps games at the gas station. Hooker sets him up with Ferguson Edwards (Lee Grant) in Chicago. Mr. Edwards (Bruce Dern) is her blind partner. Sonny Binkley takes him around to play. He charms nice girl Aggie Donaldson (Suzy Amis) who has a past with Sonny. He goes to a private game at the Gem Club owned by George Cole (Tommy Lee Jones) where Cole's wife Lorry Dane (Diane Lane) dances. He breaks the bank angering Cole. The next night, Cole sets him up with loaded dice. Then gambler Phil Carpenter (Tom Skerritt) from California comes in.I've never been a fan of Matt Dillon coming in hard as a cocky young stud lead. He's too pigheaded to like. He's not as charming as he acts. He needs some vulnerability and more introspection. The production style is limited and the directing style is craps. There are some interesting actors but the story lacks sustained life. It has sections where the story is compelling. J.C.'s gambling with Cole over the two nights has good tension but it doesn't keep it going. It gets tied down with a messy story and an unlikeable Dillon. The movie could be good if it simplified to just them and Diane Lane. But I doubt it.</p>
