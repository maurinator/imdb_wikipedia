<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Ripley is sent to Europe by Mr. Greenleaf to fetch his spoiled, playboy son, Philippe, and bring him back home to the States. In return, Tom will receive $5,000. Philippe toys with Tom, pretending he will go back home, but has no intentions of leaving his bride to be, Marge, and honoring his father's wishes. After some time passes, Mr. Greenleaf considers the mission a failure and cuts Tom off. Tom, in desperation, kills Philippe, assumes his identity, and lives the life of a rich playboy. However, he will need all his conman abilities to keep Philippe's friends and the police off the trail.</p>
<p>Tom Ripley and Philippe Greenleaf are lately inseparable friends. They're both idling in Europe, but on papa Greenleaf's dime. Philippe's fianc√©e Marge feels sorry for Tom but resents his presence, while Philippe's other friend, Freddie, considers Tom Ripley a worthless moocher. But there's more to Tom Ripley, the mimic, the forger, the talented criminal improviser, than anyone, even Tom Ripley himself, can guess.</p>
<p>With no money of his own, Tom Ripley lives comfortably enough off the kindness of his wealthy companions. For a fee of $5,000, he is hired by the father of his childhood friend, Philippe Greenleaf, to retrieve Philippe from Rome and bring him back to San Francisco. Upon Tom's arrival in Rome, Philippe knows Tom's task, and while keeping Tom as a companion, strings him along, as Philippe has no intention of going with Tom back to the US. Philippe treats Tom poorly as he knows Tom will endure the abuse to get the money. But as Tom, Philippe and Philippe's girlfriend Marge Duval sail from Rome to Taormina aboard Philippe's sailboat for a short vacation, Philippe knows that Tom is not all he appears on the surface. Conversely, Tom, using two of his innate skills, has other plans to make money, far more than the $5,000 fee. Beyond the primary act of his plan, Tom is required not only to outwit the authorities, but also to manipulate those that know both Philippe and him, who include Marge, their American acquaintance Freddy Miles, and another acquaintance named O'Brien.</p>
<p>Tom Ripley is a talented mimic, moocher, forger and all-around criminal improviser; but there's more to Tom Ripley than even he can guess.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Visually, this film could serve as a cinematic poster for a Mediterranean cruise. Cinematographer Henri Decae draws us into the film with its alluring Italian locales and gorgeous panoramic vistas. Bright, complementary hues and high color contrast translate into eye-popping reds and yellows. And, of course, there's the deep blue color of the sea, and a brilliant sunlit sky. Such is the setting for a story wherein three attractive, young adults (Tom, Philippe, and Marge) test a 3-way relationship that is far more complex than it first appears.Indeed, trouble lurks beneath the surface (so to speak), in this "Italiano paradiso" thriller. In the first forty minutes, the psychological motivations of our three beautiful people are unclear and subject to change. It's hard to tell who is doing what to whom. Subsequent to this narrative setup, we see exactly where the story is headed. Because "Plein Soleil" is a psychodrama, casting is important. The three leads (Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet, and Marie Laforet) are all convincing in their roles.I have not read the Highsmith novel on which the screenplay was based. So I cannot make an intertextual analysis. I do think this 1960 film is superior, for various reasons, to the more recent remake. Adroitly directed by Rene Clement, with a buoyant musical score by Nino Rota, "Plein Soleil" is a character study of an amoral pleasure seeker whose charming personality masks the evil within. The juxtaposition of inwardly criminal intent with outwardly idyllic scenes of Italy and the Mediterranean results is an art house film that is both picturesque and suspenseful. It's a film that appeals both to our eyes and to our brains.</p>
