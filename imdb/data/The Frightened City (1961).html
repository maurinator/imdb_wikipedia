<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Surprisingly there is only one review for this film from the UK.I can say that I knew Soho well at the time this film was made when the protection rackets were controlled by the Krays and they really made the characters in this film seem like choirboys.Unlike Connery in the climax,witnesses were either to terrified to talk or were nobbled.I happened to be at the Old Bailey and was in court when the judge found the Krays not guilty.It was only their desire to match each other for killings that finally got them put behind bars.It is interesting to note that this film only got an "A" certificate so obviously the censor did not believe that it was that tough a film.Connery was third billed but clearly the star of the film.Alfred Marks ,one of my favourites,plays against type as a slimy crime boss who has his ambitions spiked in a painful way.A scene I have always remembered.This film was indicative of the direction in which the film industry was headed.</p>
