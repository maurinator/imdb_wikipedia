<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After his family is brutally murdered for an unknown reason, a computer engineer sets out to find those responsible.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first saw this movie, I was only 9 years old.  The movies idea, losing one's entire family to terrorists, haunted me for years.  George Kennedy's strong portrayl of a father who is obsessed about tracking down the killers of his family, can easily be outdone by newer more daring plots. For it's time though, The Human Factor was 'on the edge of your seat' suspense that left you with a weary, empty feeling when the movie was over. Although dated, I feel it can still create an emotional response for someone who looks for more than special effects in a picture.  Too bad it is out of print.</p>
