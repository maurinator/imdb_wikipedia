<h1>Tarzan (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Picking up where the film left off, Tarzan is reunited with his animal family while assuming greater responsibilities as the successor to Kerchak. Tarzan, now king of the beasts, must protect the wildlife and the jungle itself. Tarzan also continues to learn about humans through the teachings of Jane.</p>
<p>The further adventures of the jungle hero and his friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This show is terrific!  It's funny and full of new characters who are barrowed from the original Tarzan stories.  It shows that there is life/adventure after marriage for a Disney couple.  Okay, so the animation isn't the greatest, but the voices wonderful.  The replacements for Tarzan, Jane, Terk, and Tantor do a job worthy of the big screen film.  I recommend this cartoon for anyone who loves a good adventure and anyone who has read the Edgar Rice Burroughs's books.</p>
