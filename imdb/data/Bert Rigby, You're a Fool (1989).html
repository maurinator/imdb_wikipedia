<h1>Bert Rigby, You're a Fool (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bert Rigby lives in the small dying town Langmore, where most people depend on badly doing mining corporation. While his fellows are on strike once again, he decides to try his luck in show-biz meanwhile. His first appearance on stage goes all wrong - but the audience loves him anyways. So he starts as a comedian in a traveling amateur show for $50 a night. One day he gets an offer from an ad director from Hollywood and flies to America, expecting a great career... and again leaving behind his pregnant young wife.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was flipping through the channels on TV one night and stumbled onto this movie at the beginning.  It looked kind of stupid, but I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.  This movie is funny throughout.  Robert Lindsay (Divorcing Jack) stars as Bert Rigby a man trying to get his big break in show business.  He always seems to get an opportunity, but have it not work out.  The movie is kind of a fantasy comedy, with a lot of musical numbers. It is funny, Lindsay is great in the lead.  Anne Bancroft (Home for the Holidays) gives a very funny supporting performance.  Corbin Berenson (Major League) gives a good performance as a big Hollywood star.  I recommend it.</p>
