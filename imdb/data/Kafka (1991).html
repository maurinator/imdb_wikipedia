<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>1st watched 10/3/1998 - 5 out of 10(Dir - Steven Sonderbergh): Despite it's excellent 1st hour with Jeromy Iron's playing a quirky insurance inspector investigating the strangeness surrounding his partner's disappearance, the movie get's lost in a Frankenstein mode and it never returns.  The quest for the goings on in the castle do not lend to the humor of the 1st hour and seem to have needed to be in another movie.</p>
