<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pretty boring slapstick comedy about a school teacher (Jon Lovitz) who is sent to teach at a school in the "hood." Lovitz does his usual routine in this lackluster Jim Abrahams-scripted comedy. It has its occasional moments but it's just not good enough to qualify for a feature film. Maybe a brief "SNL" skit, but not a movie.I think Lovitz is pretty funny, and without him there would have been no Phil Hartman on "SNL" (literally! check out his bio on IMDb for more info), but here he does his same old schtick with the same old gags. It's not very funny.Lovitz would perfect his overwhelmed everyman role in "Rat Race" (2001). But here he seems more overwhelmed with the quality of the film, which isn't too terribly surprising.2/5 stars.John Ulmer</p>
