<h1>Bad Medicine (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jeff Marx wants to study medicine and become a physician. However, his grades are far from enough to get him into an American medical school. But instead he gets a chance to study medicine abroad, in a small Latin American dictatorship, governed by the dictator Ramon Madera, who fall in love with Jeff's girlfriend, also a medical student.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The archetype of Medical School Comedy is the British film DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE to which no American flick can hardly dare to be compared.Yet this film and Gross Anatomy deserve an honorable though distant second place. In BAD MEDICINE young Americans out of the zone of consideration for American schools transplant themselves to Latin America to study medicine against the challenges of a strong local culture, particularly the absolutism of Latin schools where discipline is considerably more rigorous than back home.There are two characters who best represent the reaction of the locals: the director of the school who openly tells Americans: HERE WE ARE THE ELITE and the director's secretary who proclaims her love for American culture having studied it thoroughly through Philip Roth's pulp novels.But there is a serious side to the dictatorial ways of the director. A doctor handles people's lives and must account for his actions.That degree of understanding of the serious task at hand is bye the bye entirely lost in PATCH ADAMS who can cause a young med student's death and make a joke of it.</p>
