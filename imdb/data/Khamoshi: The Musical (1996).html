<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kahmoshi The Musical, is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's first directorial venture - a sensitive, introspective film about a deaf mute Catholic couple living in Goa. The world of Joseph (Nana Patekar) and Flavy (Seema Biswas) is a silent one and into this world in born their first child Annie (Manisha) who can speak and hear & loves music. She is trained in music by her grandmother Maria (Helen) but the family is so poor they have to sell many cherished belongings including their piano. Annie's younger brother dies tragically leaving the family stunned and music is banished from their lives. Into Annie's world walks in the dashing Raj (Salman Khan) a budding musician. Raj falls for Annie and wants her to sing his songs. Annie's father hates Raj - the usual confrontations, despair follow. Annie's meeting up with Raj is followed by a catastrophe and we wait for the outcome while the story is told to us in flashback.The musical is naturally full of music - some of it is hauntingly beautiful - songs like Bahon ke Darmiyan, Jaana suno hum tumpe marte hain, Yeh Dil Sun Raha Hai and extremely touching in the film. But there is just too much music. After about an hour I was cowering at the thought of yet another number as the hero and heroine would run up and down the steps of the lighthouse. Some songs are just fillers and do not add to or move the story forward in any way. With some crisp editing, and a few fewer songs, Khamoshi would have clocked at 2 hours and been a perfect film. The marriage of music and the serious content of the material also jarred at times.The acting: Manisha steals the show utterly and absolutely. Is there anything she cannot do? Her break down when her father throws her out of the house is a virtuoso performance. Salman is the best he will ever be, handsome, no overt gimmicky moves or gestures, just plain and simple acting - after seeing Khamoshi I can see what people saw in Salman. But even Mr. Bhansali could not keep his restrained for ever and we got Samir in HDDCS! Nana Patekar was okay - actually he was the biggest disappointment - his acting was sort of repetitive and he did not age at all in the span of 20 years showed in the film. Seema Biswas was awesome - seeing her I felt all the anguish and pain a mute person would feel at their inability to communicate. She blew me away as the film opened and she put her ear to the big speaker and "felt" the music. Helen was excellent - a great role for her too - one of her better ones where she was required to act. The little girl who played the young Annie was amazing.The story is simple yet very effective, the direction is deft but Bhansali shows his self indulgence even in this minimal film. There is a monologue by Nana Patekar (being 'translated' by Salman) that tell us the whole story all over again - is it necessary? But overall this is an excellent directorial debut and a movie worth watching. Be warned that this is serious fare and will require patience.</p>
