<h1>The Disorderly Orderly (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When he flunks out of med school, Jerome Littlefield goes to work as an orderly in a private rest home where he wreaks havoc for everyone concerned. Dr. Jean Howard is the exasperated head of the sanitarium who almost becomes a patient after the antics of the frantic employee. When talkative patient Mrs. Fuzzibee happily and continuously relates her maladies to Jerome, he hilariously has psychosomatic symptoms that mirror those of the nutty woman. He discovers that his high school girl of his dreams, Susan Andrews has been brought to the sanitarium after a suicide attempt. He secretly pays for the destitute young woman's stay while helping to restore her confidence and self respect, much to the jealousy of his girlfriend, Julie Blair, a young and pretty nurse who has high hopes of becoming the future Mrs. Littlefield.</p>
<p>Jerome Littlefield works at a local hospital as an orderly. He was once a promising medical student but was forced to quit medical school when his empathy for his ill patients had him developing their symptoms. He's undergone sessions with a hospital psychiatrist and has the support of both his girlfriend, nurse Julie Blair, and the hospital administrator, Dr. Jean Howard, but no one has been able to get to the root of his problem. Jerome is surprised when his high school dream girl, Susan Andrews, is admitted to the hospital after a suicide attempt. She treats him very badly and as was the case in high school, has absolutely no idea who he is. When she is unable to pay her hospital bills, Jerome works all hours of the day and night to pay them anonymously. In the end, Susan proves to be the source of his problems and that realization paves the way to a brighter future.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jerry Lewis may have reached his wackiest here. He plays Jerome Littlefield, an orderly who appears to be a combination of Insp. Clouseau and Gilligan. Pretty much most of the movie features him getting into a series of embarrassing situations. I personally think that they could have just left it at that and avoided the love story.And yes, that's Alice Pearce as the over-communicative Miss Fuzzibee, right before she got the role of a certain nosy neighbor suspicious that there's a witch or something in the neighborhood. All in all, "The Disorderly Orderly" is classic comedy at its best. You gotta wonder how they did some of those scenes. Also starring Kathleen Freeman.</p>
