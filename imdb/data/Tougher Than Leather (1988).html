<h1>Tougher Than Leather (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Legendary hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. stars in this cross between a blaxploitation film and a spaghetti western. They must find and punish the evil drug lord-record company executive who murdered their friend. Along the way, they encounter racist bikers, blonde bimbos, and the Beastie Boys!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the worst movies I've seen. First of all Run DMC is very overrated and how you are going to make a movie about avenging a friends murder then turn it into a damn Krush Groove 2. There is corny performances and such and such. The acting is so bad it makes Sheila E. look like a veteran actress.</p>
