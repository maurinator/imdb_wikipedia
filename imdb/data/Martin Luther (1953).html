<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This excellent film brings to life Luther's growing realization that the religion, to which he had dedicated his life, was flawed. His character is shown to mature in believable stages, culminating in acts of ferocious courage.The costumes, sets and hairstyles were authentic and help transport the viewer to the past very effectively.Luther's message and wisdom are amply portrayed and serve as a basis for anyone to examine their beliefs.The film does not suffer from dating, even though it was made over 50 years ago. The black and white imagery imparts a sense of timelessness, worthy of the subject matter. The acting is, almost without exception, very natural and believable.</p>
