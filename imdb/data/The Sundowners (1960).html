<h1>The Sundowners (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Australian Outback, the Carmody family--Paddy, Ida and their teenage son Sean--are sheep drovers, always on the move. Ida and Sean want to settle down and buy a farm. Paddy wants to keep moving. A sheep-shearing contest, the birth of a child, drinking, gambling and a race horse will all have a part in the final decision.</p>
<p>The Carmodys - husband and wife Paddy and Ida, and their young teen-aged son Sean - are a migrant family in 1920's Australia. Paddy works primarily as a sheep drover. Paddy loves their lifestyle, figuring that they are not dependent on the fortunes of one piece of land or on the strict daily timetable and routine of farm life. However, Ida and Sean both dream of having their own farm so that they can have a more stable and permanent home life. Ida also does not like the feeling that people they meet feel sorry for them. But on their latest six-week job droving sheep from Bulinga to Cawndilla, Ida at least gets Paddy to agree to think about settling down. Paddy's agreement is more to get her off the topic than a real want to do it. Rather than leave Cawndilla immediately for Queensland as was Paddy's original plan, Ida manages to get them all jobs - Paddy as a sheep shearer, Ida as the farmhand cook, Sean as a tar boy and their new older British companion Rupe Venneker as a wool roller - at Halstead farm, despite Paddy doing whatever he could not to make it happen. Although he had no ties to the place before arriving, Rupe has his own reasons now for wanting to stay in Cawndilla. The longer Paddy, Ida and Sean stay in Cawndilla, the more evident their differences become. Ida and Sean know that by the end of the season they will have enough money for a down payment for the farm they have their eye on in Bulinga. But Paddy hates his job the longer he does it, and if he makes up his mind to leave, he will do so with or without the rest of his family. A race horse named the Sundowner may factor into the Carmody's ultimate decision.</p>
<p>In Australia's Outback during the early 20th century the impoverished Carmody family lives a nomadic life out of their wagon but the mom and son want to settle while the dad is against it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's a real joy just to watch this movie. It's a movie where the characters really seem to come to life and inhabit the world which is presented to us by director Fred Zinnemann. Even though the movie is basically about the strong ties that keep a family together during changing times, he never lets it get soppy. Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr play an Australian couple who travel the around Australia, pick up jobs like cattle-driving and sheep-shearing where they can, and never stay in place for too long. Michael Anderson, Jr. plays their 16-year-old son, who begins to yearn for a steady home and station in life. There are so many great things in the movie: the photography, the way the story unfolds in an amusingly rambling pace, etc. But the best has to be the cast. The Sundowners is probably Deborah Kerr's least glamorous role and yet she has never been more attractive and appealing than here. Perhaps it took a more gritty setting to really bring her beauty to the surface. She seems less weighed down here than in other roles. Robert Mitchum is a big hunk of tasteful testosterone. A beer-drinking man's man who gets into fights but who nevertheless is completely faithful to his family. Michael Anderson, Jr. is great at being youthfully sunny and yet awkwardly self-conscious at the same time. The movie has a truly great scene where the strong Mitchum faces off against a frail-looking old man in a sheep-shearing contest and is surprisingly pushed way beyond his physical limits. This dream of a movie also stars Peter Ustinov and Glynis Johns in memorable roles. **** out of ****</p>
