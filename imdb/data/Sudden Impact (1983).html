<h1>Sudden Impact (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A vicious serial-killer is on the loose in San Francisco and the police trace a link to a small town further down the coast. When Harry Callahan upsets the press and the mayor in his usual style, he's shipped out of town to investigate while the heat is on. With the help of his new Magnum handgun Harry goes on the trail leaving behind the usual trail of dead criminals along the way.</p>
<p>With years have passed since the Scorpio killer, a band of renegade cops, and a terrorist group were all up against one tough Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan, a new killer has now emerged and might prove to be Callahan's most dangerous enemy yet. From San Francisco to San Paulo, a rape victim has turned into a cold-blooded vigilante killer and is out gunning down her attackers one by one. But right behind the bloody trail, is an aging, but still bitter Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan, who's not only a target of a crime syndicate which he was sent away for, but ends up being entangled between the killer's vengeful vendetta and irresistible lust.</p>
<p>This is Clint Eastwood's fourth Dirty Harry film. In this movie, Harry's in hot water with his superiors; when he induces a heart attack on a criminal they have spent a great deal of time building a case on, and some criminals are gunning for him. So, to make the streets a little safer, Harry's sent to seaside town, to get some info on a man who was shot in the groin. When he gets there, the police chief doesn't exactly give him a warm welcome. And not long after his arrival, some of the town's residents are getting killed in the same manner. When Harry tells the chief his theory that the killer has a connection here but the chief just wants him to leave.</p>
<p>A rape victim is exacting revenge on her aggressors in a small town outside San Francisco. "Dirty" Harry Callahan, on suspension for angering his superiors (again), is assigned to the case.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Dirty Harry series are great films. Forget reality and political correctness, just enjoy the films. Like the rest of the series the formula is perfect in Sudden Impact, a great actor delivering action, humour, thrills and excitement.</p>
