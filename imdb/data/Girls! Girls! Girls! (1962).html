<p>Elvis plays Ross Carpenter, a fishing guide/sailor who loves his life out on the sea. When he finds out his boss is retiring to Arizona, he has to find a way to buy the Westwind, a boat that he and his father built. He is also caught between two women: insensitive club singer Robin and sweet Laurel.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was yet another strong movie by Elvis. The plot was good the scenery was great and music was outstanding. This is probably my favorite soundtrack. I like the way Elvis falls for a rich woman (he doesn't know she's rich) and is trying to buy the boat that once belonged to his father. This is definately a feel good movie. I give this movie four stars.</p>
