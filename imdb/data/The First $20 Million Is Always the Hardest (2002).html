<h2> Summaries </h2>

He recruits the only available guys at the lab, three sociopaths. Together they really compile a revolutionary PC for $99, but then they become the victims of a venture capitalist and Andy's old foe from the research lab. Can he and his new friends find a way to overcome the problems?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Movie is well done, the cast has good comedic timing and Miss Dawson shines in her role as the sensitive artist. The cast works well together each highlighting the others presence.  It's a good comical farce and a good buy at $14.  The perfect afternoon movie when some laughs are in order.</p>
