<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The scenes of high emotion work extremely well in this drama.  However, not all the drama delivers.  Some of the dialogue is strained and there are stretches when I honestly had no idea what anyone was talking about.Kristofferson is very good for the most part but is wooden at times too.  Jobeth Williams,  Brian Keith and the late Trey Wilson make an impression in their scenes.  Sam Waterston is not given a whole lot to do but stand around and look confused but he does have one great scene with his stepson regarding the return to life of Kristofferson. The end might have been needlessly sappy, but it got to me anyway.</p>
