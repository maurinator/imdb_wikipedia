<h1>Dangerous Ground (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vusi Madlazi returns to the South African village he left as a young boy (he was organizing against apartheid, and left in fear of his life) to bury his father. He meets up with his brother Ernest, who tells him their other brother Stephen couldn't be contacted. Vusi goes to Johannesburg to find him, but at first can only find his neighbor/girlfriend, Karin, a stripper. Vusi proceeds to learn how conditions have changed since the end of apartheid, not always for the better for black men.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked the movie, it moved along & kept your attention, but Elzabeth Hurley, talk about a fabulous woman, I dont care if she can act, she looks good enough that it doesnt matter.  Even if just to see her portrayal of a junkie stripper is worth the price of the movie.  If your a Hurley fan, watch this movie!</p>
