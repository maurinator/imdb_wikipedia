<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie as much as anyone, but the recently released DVD is inexplicably almost half an hour shorter than the version of this film that has been in release on video and laserdisc for years.  Why, oh why MGM/UA did this, I don't know, but I know I am not keeping my copy of it.  I got worried when this new version didn't have an overture...but I can live without that.  However, when Richard Widmark's first scene occurred and over half of it was missing, I could only groan.  Shame on you MGM/UA.  This movie is more than a classic for a good many  of us.  You should release the cut that you have been putting out for years now, the one that is 3 hours, 10 mins.</p>
