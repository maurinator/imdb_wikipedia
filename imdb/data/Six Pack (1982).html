<h1>Six Pack (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Stopping briefly in a small Texas town, an itinerant race car driver finds that his stock car, on a trailer behind his motor home, has just been quickly and expertly stripped. He chases down the miscreants, who turn out to be six orphan children. He has no recourse to the law, for the corrupt local sheriff takes most of the proceeds of their thievery in exchange for not putting them in an orphanage. They are charming rogues who are in turn charmed by him. Disliking their arrangement with the sheriff, they stow away with him, and he finds himself becoming a reluctant stepfather. Thanks to their enthusiasm and incredible mechanical know-how, he begins to make a name for himself on the racing circuit. But the sheriff doesn't take kindly to losing his extra income...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm not a huge Kenny Rogers fan, in particular. I've seen a few of his movies, I like his work on the general end of things, and I have to say, I thought this movie was one of his best. For me, back in 1982, the kids are what made the movie. I caught it on TV again last night (2005) - had to watch it as I recorded it for my 13 year old - and it appealed to me as much now, as an adult, as it did for me when I was a kid. The language can be a bit crass at times, but I really considered this movie to be done in good taste, and my 13 year old has been asking to see it for months now. The main song is catchy, the characters are lovable, and Kenny Rogers... well, he's a good guy. It's a good story, heartwarming to the end. I highly recommend this movie for "family night" with pre-teens and younger teens.</p>
