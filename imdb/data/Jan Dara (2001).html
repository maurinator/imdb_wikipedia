<h1>Jan Dara (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jan Dara grows up in a house lacking in love but abundant in lust. He quickly picks up the sinful way of life of the man who married his mother after she became pregnant from being raped. His 'father's' mistress welcomes the young boy into her literal bosom. Wanting badly to know his real father, Jan leaves the house, only coming back after Khun Luang's daughter falls pregnant out of wedlock. Jan does a favor to his 'father' by marrying her, even though he is deeply in love with the mistress. The truth about his birth, as Jan will later learn, is as confusing and messed up as his present life and the lives of those around him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The director of NangNak comes back with an old Thai wicked story. Jan Dara's mother die after giving birth to him. His step father, Khun Luang, blamed and hated him for that. Jan wasn't welcome in the family. Khun Luang was a playboy, and taught his real child to hate Jan.... Jan seek to find who is his real father and love/sex.This story is about love/ sex. I think it's a real twisted (wicked) story... a lot of unexpected things. A great production, great color, set is ok, music isn't that good (reusing one song a lot). But a very good directing, editing. Overall, it was great. One of my favorite movie this year.</p>
