<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I was little, I absolutely loved this movie. It was so touching. I was born in 1973, so I watched this when I was pretty young. I think it was on HBO. Anyway, I loved Elvis and I loved this movie. My grandmother loved Elvis and I looked up to grandma. Diane Lane is wonderful in it, I also adored another one of her younger actress movies: A Little Romance. So, I've always thought she was a great actress. I wish this movie would come out on DVD! I'm dying to see it again. Maybe they have it on VHS at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video, I'll have to check into that. I wonder if I'll still need a box of tissues to watch it! Enjoy.</p>
