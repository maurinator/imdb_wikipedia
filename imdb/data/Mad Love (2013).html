<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This eerie series continues and it really probes into the psyche of this sick, sadistic cult.We also learn that Ryan's personal life has been a tragic one. We also learn that his current tormentor actually believes that when she murders him by ruining his pacemaker, Joe will be to blame for originally stabbing him.Imagine the secret of one of the nasty cult members is that he has never killed. He actually frees his Asian lady victim, only for her to fall victim to the others as she escapes.The professor's wife laments the fact that the FBI had better capture her kidnapped son quickly. They're already teaching him how to kill-first with animals. Absolutely horrifying.</p>
