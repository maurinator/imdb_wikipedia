<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>E! Mysteries & Scandals: Ed Wood (1999) Maila Nurmi (Vampira), Dolores Fuller, Paul Marco, Martin Landau, Buddy Barnett (Cult Magazine), Norma McCarty (wife) and Gregory Walcott are interviewed as they discuss the hard times of filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr..This episode will certainly appeal to fans of Wood and I'm sure the majority of them already know everything about the filmmaker. This episode is worth watching for them since it features so many people connected to Wood including his girlfriend, his wife and many of those who acted in his films. That alone makes this worth watching for fans of the infamous director. Regular fans of the series might not get as much entertainment from the episode because, well, Wood just isn't all that well-known outside his cult of fans. Still, the interviews are great and the episode gives general viewers a good idea of who Wood was.Episode: A-</p>
