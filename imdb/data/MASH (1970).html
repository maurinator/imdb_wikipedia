<h1>MASH (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The personnel at the 4077 MASH unit deal with the horrors of the Korean War and the stresses faced in surgery by whatever means. The tone at the MASH is established by recent arrivals, surgeons Captains 'Hawkeye' Pierce, 'Duke' Forrest, and 'Trapper' John McIntyre - the latter who Hawkeye knows he's met somewhere, but Trapper who won't divulge where - whose antics can be best described as non-regulation, and in the negative words of one of their fellow MASH-ers: unmilitary. The unit's commanding officer, Colonel Henry Blake, doesn't care about this behavior as long as it doesn't affect him, and as long as they do their job and do it well, which they do. Their behavior does extremely bother fellow surgeon, Major Frank Burns, and recently arrived head nurse, Major Margaret Houlihan, who obtains the nickname 'Hot Lips' based on information they glean about her through underhanded means. Beyond their battles with Frank and Hot Lips, Hawkeye, Duke and/or Trapper help unit dentist Painless with a personal crisis, try to figure out if Hot Lips is a true blond, travel to Japan for a work and what they hope is a recreational trip, and hope to win big on a football bet against another unit in which they on the surface are the underdogs.</p>
<p>Based on the novels of Richard Hooker, this Richard Altman film follows the zany surgeons and other staff of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Korea. Although the top-ranked series is based on this film, it was homogenated; most of the dozens of characters, amalgamated in the series, are depicted in the film just as they were in the novels.</p>
<p>Set during the Korean War, two surgeons, Captains "Hawkeye" Pierce and "Duke" Forrest, join the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), located three miles from the front lines. Both are draftees and care little for military protocols and conventions. They are soon joined by surgeon even more anarchic and insubordinate in his attitude, Captain "Trapper" John McIntyre. The unit's commander is the laid back-yet-efficient Lt Colonel Henry Blake. He is assisted by Corporal "Radar" O'Reilly. Hawkeye, Duke and Trapper soon have the camp running to their rather non-military tune but run into Major Frank Burns and the new chief nurse Major Margaret O'Houlihan, both of whom being by-the-book permanent military types. Hawkeye, Duke and Trapper set out to undermine the pair. High jinks ensue.</p>
<p>Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. That's where two young surgeons, Duke and Hawkeye end up during the Korean War. There is no plot as such, but instead a series of episodes during which they put their stamp on the camp including a football game against a larger unit with thousands riding on it, a trip to Tokyo to operate on a congressman's son and play a little golf, and finding out if the head nurse is a natural blonde.</p>
<p>November, 1951. The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is shaken up by the arrival of Captains "Hawkeye" Pierce and "Duke" Forrest...crack surgeons but lousy soldiers. Joined by renowned chest-cutter "Trapper" John McIntyre, the surgeons set about dealing with the daily carnage of the war by raising hell. From getting rid of the idiotic Major Burns to helping the camp dentist commit "suicide", there's no lengths the Swampmen won't go to to distract themselves from the horrors of war.</p>
<p>The staff of a Korean War field hospital use humor and hijinks to keep their sanity in the face of the horror of war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some people may think I'm insane for saying this. But this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It was so shockingly different back in 1970 and it influenced war films in the 70s (the "war is insane"-type atmosphere of the film was used by "Apocalypse Now".) The black comedy elements are as original as Dr Strangelove. I have watched this film over ten times and I get astounded each time by it's amazing originality. It's too bad Robert Altman doesn't get as much as recognition as Kubrick or Fellini though I feel he is in the same league. Today the admirable but inferior TV series is more well-known than the movie but I feel the movie is one of the great achievements in film history.</p>
