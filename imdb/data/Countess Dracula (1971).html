<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Shocking, poetic, well-done story loosely based on the legend of Countess Bathory of Hungary who, it is said, bathed in the blood of young virginal women for the purposes of rejuvenating her skin.  Ingrid Pitt plays the countess in all her ugly old age and her fresh nubile new skin.  Actually, Pitt does a very good job in a very difficult role of playing two women incredibly apart in age that are supposed to be the same woman.  The direction is done by Peter Sasdy,  probably the best of Hammer's latter directors, who did a very good job with Taste the Blood of Dracula and Hands of the Ripper.  Sasdy knows how to use his camera and can be quite lyrical with it.  Some of the scenes are very fresh and inventive.  One that stands out is where Pitt returns to her ugliness and all the action of her inner turmoil is seen through some broken lattice.  Quite good!  Too bad that Hammer had by this time gone to that inferior film stock.  This would have been simply gorgeous had it been done five years earlier.  Also, by this time, Hammer had to rely on more blood and violence and more exposed bosoms.  Countess Dracula is at times quite bloody, with the pinnacle I think being the scene where Pitt is actually caught unawares bathing in blood and massaging her nude bodice with a blood-soaked sponge.  Nonetheless the violence really does not detract too much from a pretty good story and execution of it.  Nor does the nudity, albeit it rather unnecessary(Andrea Lawrence is quite "charming" in her role as a serving girl...no pun intended).  The rest of the cast is very good with Nigel Green really giving a nice performance as a jealous lover and Maurice Denham excelling as a dotty old man.  The film stands as a testament to the extremes some people will go through to recapture what was past, and their self-centered, self-serving drive to remain beautiful and young.  Is it topical today?  You bet ya!</p>
