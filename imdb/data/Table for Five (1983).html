<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this movie overall. It took a while to really get into the flow of the story but it represented well what absent parents endure as children become distant and alienated. Especially if you've ever been unfortunate enough to experience a heartbreaking divorce you should pay close attention to the pyramid scene where John Voight speaks to the children about what causes families to break apart. And if you've also lost regular contact with your kids the pyramid scene as well as several other scenes will likely bring tears to your eyes. But it's not all about sadness and a broken home; it's also about how one can restore relationships through determination and should never give up hope.</p>
