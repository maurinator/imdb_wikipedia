<h1>Leave All Fair (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It was only after her death that the work of New Zealand writer, Katherine Mansfield, became well known, thanks to her editor and husband, John Middleton-Murry. She had left New Zealand to travel around France, and she died there from tuberculosis. Thirty three years later, Middleton-Murry is invited to France to approve a new edition of her collected letters and journals, and there he meets a young woman, Marie Taylor (also from NZ) who reminds him strongly of his dead wife. As the two become friends, Marie starts reading old correspondence between Mansfield and her husband, and discovers the true nature of their relationship and that Mansfield's dying wishes regarding her writings have been ignored by the manipulative, and less-than-honest, Middleton-Murry.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Much of this film was made at the Moulin d'And√©, a watermill on a loop of the Seine River not far from Vernon, in upper Normandy, France. Today this Watermill is a cultural centre with classical music concerts from all over the world as well as other cultural manifestations. The spot being pretty idyllic, this brings some relief from an otherwise flat and relatively uninteresting story. Only the true fans of Katherine Mansfield will derive some pleasure from viewing this film ; for those people who have never heard of her, the film will have little significance and they will have to make to with a series of beautiful sets. As far as I know, the film can only be purchased from video companies in New Zealand.</p>
