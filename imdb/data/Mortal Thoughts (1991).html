<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>with an impressive cast, intelligent dialogue (some improvised) and characters that are commendably well drawn; altman protege director alan rudolph should be commended for making a watchable and thought provoking movie on the subject of marital physical abuse and the retributions of such a hideous and despicable act. the plot mainly revolves around the relationship of a typical working class new jersey couple played by the then married bruce willis and demi moore. all of the situations and characters are totally believable and down to earth unlike other movies on this subject which i think make this head and shoulders above the rest. sterling supporting performances are also given by harvey keitel as the investigating officer and glen headley as demi moore's friend. the flashback sequences are particularly well done and effective and in no way affect the overall tension which is expertly handled throughout and which constantly keeps the viewer on their toes. a movie to be treasured!</p>
