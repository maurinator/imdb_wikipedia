<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've always liked this film despite its flaws.  It is an interesting allegory of racial conflict, using a sci-fi premise and a "buddy-cop" formula.  You have the minority rookie cop assigned to the bigoted partner, who are then assigned a case involving the minority group.  The rookie proves to the bigot that people are the same, despite their physical differences and they slowly become friends.Mandy Patinkin is great here, conveying the idea of an outsider who is not totally familiar with his new environment.  James Caan is fine, but doesn't seem committed to the film, and his performance is a bit uneven.  Terence Stamp is hurt by his makeup, as his face is one of his greatest strengths as an actor.  Much of his characters come from his facial expressions and the makeup inhibits this.The story is a bit cliched, but the sci-fi gloss keeps things from falling flat.  The tv series was better able to explore the racial allegory, as the film just doesn't have enough screen time.  The mystery component is pretty much standard fare.  If you look beyond the surface of this film, there are some worthwhile ideas here.  They just get a bit lost in the "cop" trappings.</p>
