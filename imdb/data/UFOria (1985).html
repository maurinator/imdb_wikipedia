<h1>UFOria (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sheldon Bart is a drifter, and a small-time con man. He meets his old friend, Brother Bud, a big-time con man into faith healing and fencing stolen cars, at his revival tent outside a small town. While he's helping Brother Bud, he falls in love with Arlene, a local supermarket clerk who believes in UFOs and is deeply religious and deeply lonely. When Arlene has a vision of a coming UFO, everyone deals with it in their own way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this on youtube (illegally, but where else can you see it). I heard of it years ago. If better known, it would be considered a minor classic. It's similar to Melvin & Howard or other early Jonathan Demme movies. It's funny, always interesting, got a great soundtrack, good performances all around, a thoughtful quote worthy script, and unlike a lot of similar "indie" quirky movies that came later, it never puts it's small town characters down for their goofy beliefs or marginal lifestyles. Check out UFOria and tell your friends. It's amazing that a major studio made it. The director sadly never made another feature as a writer director. He's got a good light touch, and Cindy Williams holds her own as a movie star.</p>
