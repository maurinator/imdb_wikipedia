<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has to be the best Christmas movie I have ever seen! The movie not only made Rudolf a "Lady's Man," but it gave him a girlfriend as well! Zoey, Rudolf's girlfriend, is my favorite character. The movie is funny, romantic, scary, exciting, and all the above! It is great for the whole family to enjoy. I highly recommend it for kids and adults. Even teenagers like me can enjoy it. I am 19 and I love it! For people who like romantic/adventure movies, this is for you! If you ever see this movie in the stores (DVD or VHS), buy it. You are most definitely not waisting your time and money. The person who made this movie did a great job on the animation, sound, and story plot. LOL, some of the synchronization of the voices and the characters are a bit out of sync, but that makes it comical for me! If you look past the little errors, you will enjoy a great Christmas movie, I promise.</p>
