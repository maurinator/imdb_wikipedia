<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you were never lucky enough to see the Monty Python's Flying Circus troupe live onstage, you must see this movie!  It includes many classic sketches from their BBC series, such as "The Argument Clinic" and "The Travel Agent Sketch."  Plus live renditions of such famous Python songs like "The Lumberjack Song" and "The Bruces' Philosopher Song," and sketches that weren't even on TV!  And even shots of the audience will catch your eye!  You'll know that Monty Python has achieved cult status when John Cleese comes out shouting "Albatross!", to have audience members reply with "What flavor is it?"  The only thing better than seeing this movie, is to have seen the show live!</p>
