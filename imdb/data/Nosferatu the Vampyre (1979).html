<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jonathan Harker is sent away to Count Dracula's castle to sell him a house in Varna, where Jonathan lives. But Count Dracula is a vampire, an undead ghoul living off of men's blood. Inspired by a photograph of Lucy Harker, Jonathan's wife, Dracula moves to Varna, bringing with him death and plague... An unusually contemplative version of Dracula, in which the vampire bears the curse of not being able to get old and die.</p>
<p>In Wismar, Germany, Lucy and the real state agent Jonathan Harker is a happily married couple. Jonathan's boss Renfield sends him to Transylvania to sell an old house in Wismar to Count Dracula. Jonathan is advised by the locals of a village to return since the count is a vampire, but he does not give up of his intent. Jonathan visits Count Dracula and when he sees the photograph of Lucy, he immediately buys the real estate. He drinks the blood of Jonathan and navigates to Wismar, carrying coffins with the soil of his land, rats and plague in the ship. Along the voyage, Count Dracula kills the crew-members and a ghost vessel arrives in Wismar. Meanwhile Jonathan rides to his homeland to save Lucy from the vampire.</p>
<p>Jonathan and Lucy live in Wismar and the Count wants a house there. Varna is a port on the Black Sea, close to Dracula's castle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Werner Herzog's version of Murnau's classic NOSFERATU is a captivating experience.  Klaus Kinski is perfect as Count Dracula.  He brilliantly conveys the loneliness and sadness of a creature who longs to be human. Count Dracula is the victim in this film, he does not enjoy his immortality and wants only to live, love and die like a human.  Isabelle Adjani's ethereal beauty punctuates her ghostlike performance as Lucy, and Bruno Ganz turns in another solid performance as Jonathan.Like other Herzog films, NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE is exquisitely photographed, eliciting an almost transcendental experience.  Jonathan's journey to Dracula's castle, the dancing of the plague-ridden townsfolk, and the final scene are prime examples.Once again, using the compositions of Popol Vuh and Wagner, Herzog creates an effective amalgamation of images an music.One drawback to the film is that it is so beautiful to look at, it is not especially frightening.  This may discourage some Dracula fans, but to those who want a hypnotic, smart vampire film, this is the one to see.</p>
