<h1>Vendetta (1950)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>She was a big chest breather, and had a sultry expression.She had her best shot, I thought, in WHERE DANGER LIVES, with Mitchum.George Dolenz had a good part in this; possibly his only.  He was a solid character/contract player, and deserved better.The classical musical themes and outsized, over-weighted backgrounds were effective, I thought.  Really approaching the cerebral, almost, as far as on a scale of the Howard Hughes things.</p>
