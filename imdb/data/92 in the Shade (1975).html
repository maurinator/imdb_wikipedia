<h1>92 in the Shade (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are into bell bottoms, hipsters, and quirky characters, this is your movie. Peter Fonda as usual, sleepwalks through the scenery. Warren Oates is his off kilter self, and Harry Dean Stanton is along for the ride. The supporting cast is uniformly eccentric. Unfortunately the story plays like an instructional fishing film. There are more than a few tedious moments. If you have the patience to listen carefully, some of the dialog is amusing, but not enough to sustain momentum. Ultimately, the film must be regarded as nothing more than a curiosity, with absolutely no surprises from the plot, and a very predictable ending - MERK</p>
