<h1>Funny Farm (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Andy and Elizabeth buy a farm in Vermont, they can't imagine the trouble that awaits them. Andy has quit his job as a sports journalist and is planning to use the peace and quiet of the country to write the Great American Novel. From the moment the movers' truck gets lost with their furniture, though, there's little peace and less quiet. From a manical mailman to a dead body buried in the garden, Andy is distracted by the town and its wacky inhabitants. His effort at a novel is mediocre, at best, and he's threatened by Elizabeth's foray into writing when she attempts a children's book. Can the Farmers survive the townsfolk and each other?</p>
<p>Andy and Elizabeth are sick of life in the city, and decide to move to the country. Buying a home near a picturesque town, then soon discover (to their horror) that things are done differently in the country. They must deal with all of the local characters, the local animals, as well as any skeletons in the closet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I wouldn't say this is one of Chevy Chase's best films, but this one still has some good things to offer.  There is a fair amount of good laughs and an entertaining story, but not as great as some of Chevy's other credits.Chevy Chase does a fine job with his role, playing a very similar character to most of his other films.  Chevy is good at what he does and doesn't seem to stray very far from what works.  Madolyn Smith-Osborne is fantastic in the film, looking just gorgeous and playing her role very well.  The only other actors that were familiar to me were the movers in the beginning of the film, Mike Starr and Glen Plummer.  Both actors do a fine job, although very small roles in the film.If you are a fan of Chevy Chase, then I'd recommend seeing this film, you'll probably enjoy it.  But, if Chevy Chase isn't your cup of tea, then this may not be the film for you.  In any case, if you do see it, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris</p>
