<h1>Solo Sunny (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sunny is the singer of band trying to establish itself in the music-scene of East-Berlin. They play regular gigs in small towns, but Sunny feels out of touch with the audience and her life as a whole. She begins a relationship with the amateur saxophonist and studied philosopher Ralph who writes her a very personal song - but his obsession with death and unfaithful lifestyle is not for her. After getting into a quarrel with a band member who harasses her and telling off a show-host she is thrown out of the band. Abandoned, she struggles to regain control over her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie is about the role of women in the GDR... basically, women were craving for independence and appreciation. Sunny, the lead character, tried her best to survive in a very hostile place/group. The men in her life were actually seen as the antagonists. The character development was at times inconsistent... Contradiction could also be observed in that movie like Sunny, having been developed as an independent character, needed someone, like Ralph, to fill the space or emptiness...Although I am a feminist myself, I didn't like the character of Sunny because in the movie, she was seen as a very irresponsible woman... a woman of the world... a woman who didn't care about the people around her... a modern woman... The movie is a bit dragging and exasperating at some point... but nevertheless, it is a movie about changes and realizations...</p>
