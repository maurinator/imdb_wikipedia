<h1>Thirst (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dominic and Maria were once a happy and social married couple, but an encounter with an ex turns Dominic's world upside down. Now reclusive and living in a desolate wooded area, the strained relationship is marred by Dominic's dark secret - one that has him thirsting for his wife's blood. "SED" is a modern take on the vampire genre, replacing an often glamorized look with a gritty view of the monster's struggles.</p>
