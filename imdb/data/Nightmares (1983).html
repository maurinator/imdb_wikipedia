<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie as a whole is worth watching, in any case, start to finish, but the Bishop of Battle clearly stands out.Emilio Esteves and the entire supporting cast give excellent performances. The story is both fun and scary, and the soundtrack rules.Favorite scene: In the arcade in the Mexican neighborhood.Favorite line: "There IS a level 13. I heard some kid out in Jersey got it twice."</p>
