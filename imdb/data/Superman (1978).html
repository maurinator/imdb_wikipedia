Raised by kindly farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, young Clark discovers the source of his superhuman powers and moves to Metropolis to fight evil.

<p>Surviving the destruction of the planet Krypton, young Kal-El is sent by his father Jor-El to live among mankind on Earth. Under the parenting of Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark Kent discovers that he was born with extraordinary powers and abilities beyond imagination. Now living in Metropolis, Clark takes up a job as a reporter for the Daily Planet and starts to fall head over heals for fellow reporter Lois Lane. But then Clark is also using his powers to help the better of mankind as Superman, who the people of Metropolis start turning to for help. But in the shadows, criminal genius Lex Luthor launches a sinister plan to make himself known by detonating two missiles in different parts of the country with only Superman to oppose him. Will Superman save us? Or will Luthor's plan succeed?</p>
<p>Unable to convince the ruling council of Krypton that their world will destroy itself soon, scientist Jor-El takes drastic measures to preserve the Kryptonian race: He sends his infant son Kal-El to Earth. There, gaining great powers under Earth's yellow sun, he will become a champion of truth and justice. Raised by the Kents, an elderly farm couple, Clark Kent learns that his abilities must be used for good. The adult Clark travels to Metropolis, where he becomes a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet...and a caped wonder whose amazing feats stun the city: Superman! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, the world's greatest criminal mind, is plotting the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Can't even the Man of Steel stop this nefarious scheme?</p>
<p>This movie begins on Krypton, where Superman's father sends him off to Earth as a young child. He grows up to be a perfectly normal newspaper reporter named Clark Kent. At least, he appears perfectly normal, until he transforms into Superman - flying around with his underpants over his tights, saving the day. When the evil Lex Luthor plans to take over the world, Superman is the only one who can stop him.</p>
<p>The planet Krypton is doomed. Only one man, Jor-El, knows it, and rockets his infant son to refuge on a distant world called Earth. As Jor-El's son grows to manhood, he learns he possesses super-powers he must hide from the ordinary mortals around him. And so, he disguishes himself as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter.</p>
<p>March 1938 - while a child reads a comic book about the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis, in a distant galaxy an advanced race of humans reside on the planet Krypton. Three traitors who have attempted to overthrow Krypton's ruling council are sentenced by the planet's greatest scientist, Jor-El, to an enclosed extra-dimensional prison drifting through space. However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton, which is sending it into the fatal gravitational pull of its crimson central star, a fact blithely ignored by the ruling council. Effectively placed under house arrest by the council, Jor-El and his wife Lara consent to sending their infant son, Kal-El, to a primitive planet six galaxies distant, known as Earth, where a yellow sun will fuse with his irradiated molecular density to make him strong, fast, and virtually invulnerable. The tiny starship bearing Kal-El escapes Krypton's gravity just before the planet is sucked into its red sun and both bodies are obliterated. Years later the starship reaches Earth and crashlands on a vast wheatfield near Smallville, Kansas, before local farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent. Deciding to adopt the child within the strange craft, the Kents name him Clark and he loves them as his true parents. Many years pass and he is now a high schooler shunned by many of his peers. But following a tragic incident, he learns the truth about his genesis, and a personal exodus to the very summit of the North Pole leads to the creation of a vast crystaline fortress within which Kal-El learns the full truth of his existence from the spirit of his true father, Jor-El. He now becomes a fully matured man, clad in a red and blue costume bearing the S-shaped crest of the House Of El, with the mission of protecting his newly adopted home planet in the memory of his true homeworld, and in such capacity he disguises himself as a meek newswriter in which guise he can learn of threats to his adopted homeworld - one of which occurs in an act of trachery by an arrogant criminal mastermind living in a vast headquarters 200 feet beneath the surface of Metropolis, an act of treachery that sends nuclear missiles flying off course and detonates a gigantic earthquake that threatens to destroy California.</p>
<p>The infant Kal-El, of the planet Krypton, makes his journey to Earth in a ship constructed by his father, Jor-El, just as the planet explodes. Crashing down in the midwest United States, the boy is adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. After Jonathan's death several years later, Kal-El - now known as Clark Kent - learns of his true identity from the ghost of Jor-El. He has great powers - he can fly, outrun a train, and lift up a 1-ton truck. But it isn't until he gains a job at Metropolis' Daily Planet newspaper that things begin to come together. One night, after leaving work, he sees a helicopter crash on the building's roof. From this night on, he will be known by a new name...SUPERMAN! His mission: "To fight for truth, justice and the American Way". Lex Luthor, however, has other ideas - to sabotage a pair of nuclear missiles and use them to create an earthquake that will wipe out the California coastline. Superman must race against time and stop a sinister plan by Luthor to eliminate him before millions of innocent people are killed.</p>
<p>An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where he grows up to become his adoptive home's first and greatest superhero.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is my 301st review on IMDb, so I'm going to make this short, simple, and super:"You'll believe a man can fly!" - the tagline for "Superman"He stood for "truth, justice, and the American way." Ahh, to just think that this is the movie that started it all, ladies and gentlemen. Carefully adapted from the popular DC Comics character created by Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, Richard Donner's 1978 epic has stood the test of time to become the supreme superhero film. Alongside Tim Burton ("Batman") and Sam Raimi ("Spider-Man"), Donner earned his place in cinematic history by becoming the first director to make a perfect superhero film. Superman is the most recognizable comic book superhero in history, and when Clark Kent (the late, great Christopher Reeve) rips open his shirt to reveal that symbolic "S" an hour and 11 minutes into the film, you know that it's one of the greatest cinematic moments. This epic defined the superhero film, and in the 27 years since its release, every subsequent comic book superhero movie is forever indebted to "Superman." The plot (and what a plot) runs complete throughout its epic 154 minutes and believe me, there's not a single wasted moment in the film's entire running length. Of course, Clark Kent is sent from his dying home world of Krypton by his father Jor-El (the late Marlon Brando), grows up and works at the Daily Planet, falls in love with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and must foil the diabolical plans of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Put simply, there will never be another movie like "Superman," and who can forget those *cosmic* credits, the aforementioned "S" scene, the Superman and Lois date over New York City and later above the clouds, and that one, definitive climax when Superman lets out a painful cry that reveals that one glint of humanity that he's earned from his time on earth. Reeve will forever be linked to the role that really made people believe he was a super man, even when he wasn't wearing the blues, reds, and yellows, and was instead confined to the prison that's called a wheelchair. But we know that he's up there, flying high with the Almighty and proving to us all that he is who we believed he was. The recent news that Bryan Singer ("X-Men") is directing a new Superman is not exactly getting me giddy, considering the low standards of today's film-making and the onslaught of CGI effects that dominate many Hollywood action movies these days. I love "Superman" and even today, I'm still touched by its magic, and deeply saddened by the real-life tragedies that have followed it.A perfect, "super" 10/10.</p>
