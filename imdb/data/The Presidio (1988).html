<h1>The Presidio (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jay Austin is now a civilian police detective. Colonel Caldwell was his commanding officer years before when he left the military police over a disagreement over the handling of a drunk driver. Now a series of murders that cross jurisdictions force them to work together again. That Austin is now dating Caldwell's daughter is not helping the relationship at all.</p>
<p>At the Presidio, the Army base in San Francisco, a female MP was conducting her rounds when she came across the officer's club and the door had been forced open. She went to investigate and was shot. The individuals who broke in got into their car and drove and what followed was high speed chase that got both the Army MP's and the San Francisco police involved, which ended badly for both. Jay Austin, a San Francisco Police detective, is sent to investigate and he is met by Lt. Colonel Caldwell, who was his commanding officer, when he was an MP on the Presidio. It seems that Austin tried to arrest an Army officer but didn't follow procedures and Caldwell didn't support him. And the murdered MP was Austin's partner. A preliminary investigation casts suspicion on the officer Austin tried to arrest.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sean Connery fans,this is a must. Mark Harmon fans, this is a must. Meg Ryan fans, this is a must. For: a) Sean Connery fans (of which I am one), watching Scotland's favourite son beat up a bully with his thumb is impossible to miss. He's great as a solder, and acts well (as usual). b) Mark Harmon fans, watching him as a coool detective smirking down a barrel of a gun held by a pretty much insane villain is quite amusing AND c) Meg Ryan fans, though she appears in few scenes, she takes over each one with her wild hair and sexy manner. In other words, see it. It's got an element of mystery and and action, and, in my opinion, it's very well acted. Enjoy.</p>
