<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tom and Huck is a 1995 movie released by Walt Disney Pictures starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas (T.V.'s "Home Improvement", "The Lion King")and Brad Renfro. It is based from Mark Twain's Novel about two mischievous boys Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn who, after witnessing the murder of Doc Robinson, the town's undertaker by the evil, knife-throwing Injun Joe (who will remind you of Indiana Jones if you've seen it), they must sware in blood not to tell anyone. If they don't, they will remain alive and not die; but, if they do tell anyone it was Injun Joe, he will kill them. The morning after the murder was committed, Injun Joe blames the whole thing on the town drunk, Muff Potter, saying that Muff committed the murder when Tom knows it was Injun Joe. I first saw this movie when I was a kid and recently, I have viewed it over and over again because it is one of my favorite movies. It has everything a good movie (like I have stated in reviews of other movies) should have: awesome music score composed by Stephen Endelman ("The Hunt for Murrell's Map" is a theme that fits the movie perfectly) amazing climax (being set in a huge scary cave, it makes one of the best you'll ever see), and a lesson for both boys; "When a friend's in trouble, you don't run away." One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom says "Last week Aunt Polly whipped me for swiping a pie, but it wasn't me. Figured it was Sid." Then Huck replies "He wanted it, but I beat em' to it." Then Tom says "I ought to punch you in the nose." Huck answers "You're welcome to try." Then Tom's says "Maybe later." The only reason I didn't give the film a 10 is because the accents could have been a little bit more country. Other than that, this film was great family fun. Rating: 9/10!</p>
