<h1>Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tina Balser is a bored New York housewife-mother married to Jonathan, a pompous, social-climbing lawyer who ridicules her in front of their children, criticizing everything she does or wears. She begins an affair with George Prager, a dashing, successful and blatantly sadistic writer. Finally after George has tormented Tina in much the same manner Jonathan has, and has been unfaithful to boot, she goes back to her husband and begins group therapy.</p>
<p>Diary of a Mad Housewife is set in the early 1970s New York, at a time when the role of women as worker/wife was unclear. The Women's Liberation Movement hasn't hit Bettina, however, who is deftly played by Carrie Snodgrass. A housewife whose idealistic lawyer husband has turned in to a materialistic social climber, Bettina finds herself on the verge of a nervous breakdown after a summer in the Hamptons. She struggles with her role as mother-housekeeper-wife as her husband becomes more demanding and distant, and she is constantly reminded of her 'duties' as a wife and mother. At yet another party with the mad social whirl of New York, Bettina meets George Prager, a writer whose ego is as large as Bettina's anxiety. As she works through a sexual affair with Prager, who is as verbally abusive as her husband, Bettina slowly begins to realize that she has allowed herself to be a pawn from both her lover and her husband. As her husband's facade begins to crack, she slowly gains strength and realizes that it is she that must carry the family; humor the husband so he feels better, raise her daughters to be ladies, batten down the hatches, and make things right. Bettina is a classic example of a woman searching for her identity, lost in the chorus of how 'lucky ' she is.</p>
<p>A housewife with an abusive husband has an affair with a writer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brilliant, perceptive look at isolation.  Story works on multiple levels from offbeat comedy, to drama, satire, and even feminist viewpoint. It's all rather low key, but slowly builds for a strong impact. Centers around a upper middle class New York housewife who becomes increasingly frustrated at the alienation from her husband, children, and his friends.  For a escape she has a affair with a man (Langella) that seems exciting and different, but in the end treats her just as poorly.  Ultimately she comes to the conclusion that under the facade he and many others are just as disconnected.  Film works on the basic perception that isolation is a definite reality of modern living. Terrific ending puts it all into perspective.  Takes some good satirical jabs at the 'upwardly mobile', also has good color detail and a interesting visual style.  Snodgrass's performance is excellent in a rather difficult role.  Forced to put on a 'happy face' by her obnoxious ,social climbing husband she is still able to convey her frustrations to the viewer through body language, voice tones, and facial expressions. A four star sleeper and one of Frank and Eleanor Perry's most complete work.  For TV some scenes were taken out while others added making it slightly different from the theatrical version.  For instance in the TV version Snodgrass meets Langella while walking her dog. In the theatrical version she meets him at a party.</p>
