<h1>Highlander: Endgame (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Connor MacLeod sees his old friend Rachel die in an explosion, he's had it with his immortal life and the endless pain it brings him and those he loves. He locks himself inside the Sanctuary, a Watcher-organized retreat stationed on holy ground, where immortals who are tired of the game can go to forever escape it, as well as to ensure that The Prize never falls into the wrong hands. But when an old enemy, Jacob Kell, and his posse of assassins attack the Sanctuary and kill everyone there but Connor, he is forced out into the open and into battle. Kell and Connor were friends once, and knew each other back when Connor was cast from Glenfinnan; he returned when news came that his mother was to be burned at the stake, and in the attempt to free her, Kell was killed by none other than Connor himself, and became an immortal, bitter with hate, and devoted to making Connor's life a living hell. In the present day, Connor's kinsman Duncan MacLeod is attacked by Kell's posse, including Kate, an old love of Duncan's who seeks revenge for her unwillingly being made an immortal centuries ago. This attack had something to do with Connor, and Duncan goes in search of him to find out why. In the process, he learns that in the 450 years since Connor and Kell's encounter in Glenfinnan, Kell has taken more than 600 heads and gained enough power to be called nothing less than the most powerful immortal alive. To make things worse, neither Connor nor Duncan are strong enough to face Kell alone.</p>
<p>Immortals Connor and Duncan MacLeod must join forces against Kell, an evil immortal who has become too strong for anyone to face alone.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Loved the first movie. Hated the sequels (I pretend they were never made). Never saw the TV series, though I knew about 'Duncan'. I tackled the 'Endgame' DVD with trepidation. Now it's been added to my I-want-this-one-! list. Only problem: continuity. How did Connor get from being 'the One' to being 'just one' - and what's the deal with a whole plethora of these guys being around and more waiting? The series purportedly explains that. This I can live with. The movie itself made up for it very well. Lambert exited with grace and honour, and just in time before his age really becomes an issue. I didn't know much about Adrian Paul, but after Endgame I think he's an excellent 'successor' to Lambert. I also hope they leave 'Kate' in. It'd be a nice change to the tone and pace. So, it looks like there's still hope for the Highlander movie franchise - in that they don't have to be crap as they had been. They nicely resurrected the mystical air of the first movie and the villain had a nice motivation for his actions (revenge is a GREAT motivator - much better than lust for power!) and was a better villain than the Kurgan.I noticed the overall negative comments from fans and critics alike. It's to be expected. Fans generally don't like change much (they usually want more of the same, and killing Connor off just HAD to rile them, never mind that it's the best thing they could do with the aging Lambert, who was definitely starting to look very tired), and critics are losers anyway (that's why they've become critics). Also, it seems to be that Adrian Paul brings an air of character-depth to the part that Lambert, as an actor, was never capable of exhibiting (not without signifcant overacting).  So, all around it's a winner. And, contrary to my sentiments after the previous bad sequels now I want to see MORE 8)</p>
