<h1>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A liberated young schoolteacher at an Edinburgh girls' school in the period between the two wars, instructs her girls on the ways of life. Ignoring the more mundane subjects, she teaches them of love, politics and art. Her affairs with two male teachers become known and she finds herself fighting to keep her job. She believes that she can always count on the 100% support of her favourite pupils, but one of them does not feel that Miss Jean Brodie is in her "prime" any more. No longer swayed by her teacher's eloquence, she begins to learn about life and love herself.</p>
<p>Marcia Blaine is a conservative private girls' school in Edinburgh. Among its staff is flamboyant Jean Brodie, who has a romantic view of everything she experiences, including the politics of such leaders as Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco. As she sees herself as a teacher first and foremost, she wants to impart as much of her self to her eleven and twelve year old students, but especially to her "set", those small group of girls who she finds special. She almost feels that she can preordain her students' futures, especially those of her set, and as such she has the loyalty of those girls. In the 1932/33 school year, when thirty-something Miss Brodie considers herself in the prime of her life and as such has more of her experience to impart, she has among her set: Sandy, the insightful one; Jenny, the pretty romantic; literary Monica; and timid, stuttering orphan Mary McGregor, who accepts the guidance of anyone who will provide it to her. Miss Brodie is at odds with most of the other staff, but especially the strict head mistress, Emmeline Mackay, not only because Miss Brodie does not teach the prescribed curriculum, but because of what Miss Mackay sees as Miss Brodie's improper attitude on life which she brings into her classroom. Miss Mackay's mission is to fire Miss Brodie, despite Miss Brodie having tenure. That year, Miss Brodie begins a relationship with the school's somewhat conservative music teacher, Gordon Lowther, although she is still attracted to the school's married art teacher, Teddy Lloyd, who she had an affair with and who still loves her. Her set are aware of what goes on in most of Miss Brodie's life as they spend most of their time with her, even Miss Brodie's weekends with Mr. Lowther at his seaside home in Cramond. They are however unaware of certain secrets, such as her affair with and continued attraction to Mr. Lloyd. Over the years of their life at Marcia Blaine, this specific set of girls will have a profound effect on Miss Brodie by their actions, even if she cannot or does not out of choice see those effects.</p>
<p>Jean Brodie is a dedicated if eccentric teach at an all-girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930s. She has little time for the approved curriculum and rather teaches "her girls" her own romanticized, fantasist view of history, the arts and the world in general. She is a strong supporter of Mussolini and with the onset of the Spanish Civil War, Franco. She pushes her girls to excel in what she perceives to be their strengths: Monica will act in plays; Mary McGregor will overcome her stutter and make them all proud; Jenny will be painted many times and will be a great lover; and Sandy will use her intellect and and insight and be a great spy. Sandy realizes the dangerous game Miss Brodie is playing and after one of the other girls is killed, sets out to stop her.</p>

<p>A headstrong young teacher in a private school in 1930s Edinburgh ignores the curriculum and influences her impressionable 12 year old charges with her over-romanticized world view.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is often billed as a 'one-woman show', a study of an extraordinary character, Miss Jean Brodie, played by an excellent actress. However, the movie is much more than that. It is a study of charisma and influence, of teachers and students, and presents a complex and fascinating coming-of-age story. This study takes place through the movie's double-focus on both Jean Brodie and her most precocious student, Sandy. Sandy is the strongest and most independent of Miss Brodie's students, and eventually she rebels and rejects her teaching completely. However, she is also truest to her teacher's expressed goals. Miss Brodie supposedly wants to teach 'her girls' to be like herself: powerful, independent individuals, free from the shackles of authority and group-think, beyond conventional sexual morality. In fact, she preys on the weakness and insecurity of her students, punishes independence and rewards slavish loyalty to her and to her personal plans and ideals. (The film's more subtle concern with fascism and authoritarianism echoes this theme: fascism elevates great individuals and praises their strength, just as it demands total obedience and slavishness from the rest.) Sandy, by recognizing and rejecting Miss Brodies's actions and plans, becomes her truest student: not only sexually adventurous, but bold, independent, and confrontational. The final scenes illustrate this beautifully. Miss Brodie has truly put "an old head" on Sandy's "young shoulders", and she truly is "hers for life"--though not in the way originally intended. In this way the movie presents a profound, sophisticated and realistic account of the way powerful individuals influence one another.</p>
