Kojak pretends to see the future in his lollipop while interrogating the gypsy con-artists and takes Marina in for questioning. Meanwhile her ingenious plan goes into operation without her.The men plan to cut her out, but Merina has other ideas-maybe even letting the police in on it IF she receives immunity. She has private reasons that surprise even Kojak.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a very interesting episode involving gypsies and an incredible multiple-bank heist masterminded by one of them: "Marina Sheldon" (Zohra Lampert).The opening segment has another bank heist (which is what leads to the second one, via our cunning gypsy female ("Marina"). This heist scene will get your attention! Along the way, the ever-sarcastic "Lt. Kojak" (Telly Savalas) pretends to see the future in his lollipop while interrogating the gypsy con-men (and con-women).Lots of interesting things in this episode. Perhaps the most interesting was the actress Lampert. She had a beautiful and exotic face which looked vulnerable but also tough-as-nails. She was hard to figure, but perfect for this role.</p>
