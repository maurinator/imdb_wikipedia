<p>"The Sea Tiger" is the name of a broken-down bucket of an old freighter, abandoned by the Japanese at the end of WW II, lying in anchor in a New Guiena cove. Co-owners Jenine Duval (Marguerite Chapman) and Jim Klavier (Sam Flint) have hired Ben McGrun (John Archer) as its skipper and Joe Edmun (Harry Lauter) as First Mate.Everone has designs on a none-too-secret secret safe which holds a fortune in diamonds, while a another group is after a cache of gold ingots, which the Japanese had hidden and left behind.Klavier is murdered and McGrun is accused and turns private eye---(which ensures somebody will declare this to be incorrectly another noir)to clear himself. The usual suspects include Ralph Sanford, as Fat Harry the Bartender, and portly Lyle Talbot (Williams) as a seedy insurance investigator from Sidney who may or may not be all that honest. Mara Corday's "Lola" doesn't hurt the film any, either.Archer, as usual, better suits being a Jaycee or Chamber-of-Commerce president than a tough man of the islands.</p>
