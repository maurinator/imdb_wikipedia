<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fast-talker rolls through postwar Sicily selling the dream of movie stardom, and in the process uncovers the desires and  desperation of the townspeople. Like a patent medicine salesman, he seduces them with  the magic of cinema, more potent than anything from a bottle. Be prepared for the movie to seduce you, too, with  its  gorgeously chiseled Sicilian landscapes and  faces viewed through the soul-baring lens. It gives a good view of the toughness of Sicily, and every frame has a visual richness typical of Italy itself. If you listen hard, you can make out the Sicilian accent -- even if you don't speak Italian. You'll be able to predict some of what happens, but not all, and the characters and their profiles will  linger with you longer than you might expect.</p>
