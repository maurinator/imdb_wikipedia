<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ichiro is a highly imaginative, but lonely, boy growing up in urban Tokyo. Every day he comes home to the empty apartment he shares with his railroad worker father and his restaurant hostess mother. His only friends are a toy maker name Shinpei Inami and a little girl named Sachicko. The only other kids that are around is a gang of kids led by a bully named Gabara. To escape his loneliness, Ichiro imagines that he is on Monster Island where he befriends Minya, the son of Godzilla. It is through his daydreams that he watches Godzilla and Minya fight other monsters, including one also named Gabara who is just as bad a bully as the one that is tormenting Ichiro. It is through these daydreams that he learns that it is okay to fight back and face his fears. These lessons also help him to outwit a couple of bumbling bank robbers as well as finally have the guts to stand up to Gabara and his gang.</p>
<p>A bullied schoolboy dreams of traveling to Monster Island, where he befriends Godzilla's son, who is also having bully troubles.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First off, I have to give this film a 7/10 not because I liked it, but because my youngest kids (4 and 6) loved it. You know the sort of movie that puts you to sleep but your kindergarten kids just soak right in? Films like Bionicles or HotWheels are better than a sedative, but this one isn't quite so bad thanks to the Godzilla footage and little side-stories the kids will ignore, but the adults will enjoy (admittedly not many of these, but at least they tried).the most interesting of these side stories involves the boy's friend and neighbour, the typical mussy-haired scientist-tinkerer we find in most Godzilla films. In one scene worth the price of the movie (which I got on VHS at Giant Tiger for $4) our friendly neighbourhood scientist demonstrates his new invention, an integrated monitor and keyboard desktop computer. Keep in mind this is 1968/69, Xerox PARC was only just starting to toy with such ideas in a strictly-business domain, but here in Godzilla-land they are, as usual, decades ahead of the rest of us: IIRC, the boy recommends re-tooling the workstation ... so it will play not just one, but a variety of games! Toho invented the XBox! Back to the movie, it IS possible for older audiences to watch it, but you do need to suspend your belief just a bit more than the usual acceptance of 100-foot monsters. So ... should a baby-gozilla be 4 feet high, blow smoke-rings and walk and talk? Absolutely. The key to watching this film is just as another reviewer noted, by keeping in mind that the entire film occurs inside the daydreams of a very young person. Given that, it all makes perfect sense, the plot, the dialog, the flashbacks and everything, and if you happen to actually BE a very young person, then it not only makes sense, but it enters your own life.We were setting place-mats and pillows for Minya for months after they first watched this movie.Minya fans will also be happy to know that the diminutive atomic monster returns as a principle character in the 2004 Final Wars, albeit with a non-speaking part :)</p>
