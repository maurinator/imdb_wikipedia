<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>And this Movie is definitely worth seeing.  It's so nice to go to these cinema factories and be treated with a good film, rather than the tripe which always comes out of Hollywood. Enigma is a quirky, happy go lucky film about codebreakers during the war, with a bit of espionage and a bit of romance, in just the right proportions. Go and see it, it is not too taxing on the brain really as someone else here said, it is certainly not mind numbingly boring Hollywood  fodder.</p>
