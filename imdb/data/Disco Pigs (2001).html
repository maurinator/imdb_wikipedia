<h1>Disco Pigs (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pig and Runt - born on the same day, in the same hospital, moments apart. Twins, all but by blood. Inseparable from birth, they are almost telepathic. They are also partners in crime, with an appetite for recklessness, exploration and destruction. But days before their 17th birthday the perfect balance of their world begins to shift. Pig's sexual awakening and increasing jealousy begins to threaten the private universe they have spent their lives constructing. Unable to contemplate the loss of Runt, Pig's unpredictable nature spirals out of control in a trail of violence. The invisible thread between them is stretched to breaking point, the inseparable are about to separate, and which one will survive depends on which one can break free.</p>
<p>A twisted rite of passage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Personally, I don't understand why people have said this movie is so bad. It is fair to say that maybe sometimes the things Pig (Cillian Murphy) says are a bit much and put a downside on the movie but I've heard much worse in other, highly rated, movies. The storyline itself is a simple yet interesting and well thought out one which has a fantastic ending. If you do begin to watch this movie and dislike it it is still worth watching to the end and may perhaps change your view of it a little. This is the kind of movie people will usually either love or hate. Some will find it horrible and others will find it somewhat romantic and very good. Rather than reading comments that slate it and taking that view yourself you should definitely watch it and make your own mind up.</p>
