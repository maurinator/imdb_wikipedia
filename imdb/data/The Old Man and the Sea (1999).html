<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An old fisherman goes out on his fishing trip and makes a huge catch, the biggest of his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is such a milestone that it's a shame that it will probably never be screened again in it's original IMAX format.  I was lucky enough to catch it during it's limited run in late 1999 when it was playing at the Sony IMAX in New York City.  Anyways, Petrov's animation technique involves oil painting on glass, which most animation geeks are familiar with.  When combined with IMAX the result is stunning.  There is one shot near the end of the film with shows the Cuban fishing village at night with the stars in the background.  The stars shimmer like diamonds set into dark blue velvet - incredible, beyond words, even if you are jaded about "art house" animation. If you ever hear of this film screening at an IMAX venue - don't miss it!</p>
