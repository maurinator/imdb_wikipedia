<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised and impressed to see a lead actress play such a strong role in an action-adventure movie of the 50s. Just a couple of weeks ago I was watching 'Kohinoor', another film of the 50s that falls in the same genre, where the heroine had a very clich√©d damsel in distress. In 'Baaz' (falcon) where the heroine plays the title role, she is brave, strong, sensual, a skilled fighter and a good leader throughout the whole film. Even after she falls in love with the prince, she isn't 'tamed'. Then again, I shouldn't be so surprised as the female lead has always been a strong component of the one and only Guru Dutt's films.Speaking of the film, 'Baaz' is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However, some may feel that it's a little too anti-Portuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace, it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint, especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant (but it's funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies) and the choreography is mostly dazzling (for the fight scenes and the dances).Geeta Bali effortlessly pulls off Baaz/Nisha. Next to her firm screen presence, she fights, dances and of course acts very well. The charismatic Guru Dutt looks and acts like a prince and has the right chemistry with his heroine. Kuldip Kaur is over the top but funny at times. K.N. Singh is the evil general. Ruby Mayer is good too.'Baaz' is a great classic adventure film that can easily be enjoyed with the family around. This genre seems to be lost in the recent trend of Indian cinema. But hey, the classics are always there for us to revisit.</p>
