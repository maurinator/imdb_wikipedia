<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Colossus of Rhodes" is a wonderful action thriller with  the added elements of a Hitchcock film.  Rory Calhoun is terrific as the lusty Greek playboy visiting the island who finds himself literally in the middle of a sinister conspiracy.  His villa is invaded at night by mysterious marauders and a very exciting fight ensues with Calhoun outnumbered and desperately fighting until he's downed...  It seems the noble young lady he's been chasing (Lea Massari) is also in it up to her pretty neck.  As Calhoun gets more drawn in, his safety is compromised and he has to take a side.  The duel he fights inside and outside the colossal statue is an unforgettable piece of cinema.  It's a pleasure to see Calhoun in this role which suits him, the devil-may-care playboy reluctantly forced into violent action to risk his own skin and stand up for what's right.  He was an underrated actor who deserved more roles than the many westerns to which he was mainly relegated. This is one of the few times he got to break the mold and it's a winner.  Great action, good plot, outstanding costumes and sets add to the enjoyment of seeing this film.</p>
