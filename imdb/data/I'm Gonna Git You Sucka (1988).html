<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>&#65279;Where do you begin with this film.  It had so much that was hilarious that I don't know where to begin.  One of my all time favorite scenes is when they mock the stunt doubles and you have Jack Spade's mother who is about to beat up some thugs.  She turns around and then suddenly the camera cuts from a black lady to a white male with a mustache and afro wig wearing the same clothes she is wearing, he does some back flips and then beats up the thugs.  Then when the stuntman turns around, it's back to the actress playing Spade's Mother.  I loved it.If you don't see this movie it is a shame.  Wayans did a wonderful job mocking the ridiculous exploitation movies of the seventies.   The cost of the rental alone is worth watching the scene where the guy gets out of prison, and he has been incarcerated for so long that his clothes are out of style.  You'll love the Pimp of the Year contest, Kung Fu Joe, the Big Brim Bar,  Soul Train, Hammer, Slammer, Slade and Flyguy.  The movie was a blast and you'll roll on the floor in hysteria watching as Ann Marie Johnson reveals her flaws to Jack Spade.Rent this movie.  You'll love it.</p>
