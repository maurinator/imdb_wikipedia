<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>During Napoleon's war with Spain, a young postulate at a convent near Madrid experiences her first stirrings of romantic love for a passing British Captain; she breaks her vows and runs off to be with him, but instead falls in league with traveling gypsies after her beloved is presumed dead in a rampage by the French. Unbelievable concoction, scripted by Frank Butler from Karl Vollm√∂ller's play, given uncertain treatment by director Irving Rapper. Is this material high camp or serious-minded? At times, it manages to be both, with the addition of some unintentional humor to lighten the load. Stars Carroll Baker and Roger Moore occasionally look bewildered or lost--and they get no help from Rapper, nor from their dialogue. The appropriately large-scaled production includes several set-pieces which are exciting and well-accomplished, though the plot is episodic, and each new chapter is more outlandish than the last. ** from ****</p>
