<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My first introduction to this stroy was when my best friend gave me a copy of a very battered "Desiree" by Annemarie Selinko.  When I found this movie, I was skeptical.  I love the book, and most often, when books are made into movies, they are ruined.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie fit in so well with the book, and in fact used some of the same dialogue.I felt that all of the actors did a remarkable job.  Desiree was almost exactly the way that I had pictured her.  Jean-Baptiste was also very like the image I had previously formed.  Napoleon was amazing.  He was so like the real Napoleon, I didn't have any trouble beliving that it really was him. Even though there were some things left out, like the end of the book and therefore the end of the story, I enjoyed it very much.  I would not object to seeing this movie more, and it made my love for the book increase a great deal.If you loved the movie, and even if you didn't, I would suggest getting a copy of the book.  The romance between Desiree and Napoleon is much more pronounced as well as Desiree's love for Jean-Baptiste.  The story-line is the same, but the end gives you the much needed satisfaction of seeing Desiree back in Sweden.In my opinion, this is a first-rate movie, and I reccommend it to all.</p>
