<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If the Godfather can be rated as the greatest of realistic crime or gangster movies then Mad Dog Time should be rated as the greatest of surrealistic movies. This is a film which takes the serious reality of the mob world of killers and shows them in a strange weird way that should rate this film as one of the great films of the cinema art. It is like watching mobsters in a way the painter Picasso viewed reality with his famous Cubism. In some ways it is Film Noir but in other ways it is comic and even romantic. If you want to see a different kind of crime movie that is well acted and whose meaning may be no more than the art of strange film or showing what creative film making can do, then catch this one.</p>
