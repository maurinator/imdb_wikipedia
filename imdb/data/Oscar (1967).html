<h1>Oscar (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Trouble, trouble, trouble! It is indeed under the sign of trouble... and of confusion that the crappy day Bertrand Barnier has just gone through will have been placed. The businessman will not forget it soon! And quite rightly so. Just imagine: a maid that wants to resign to... marry a baron! A masseur who treats you like an executioner of the Holy Inquisition! And, to cap it all, a right-hand man who breaks shocking news after shocking news (demanding a high pay increase, saying he has relieved his employer of a bunch of millions, stating that he has decided to marry his daughter who, incidentally, has been made pregnant by Oscar the former driver...) To say nothing of three black suitcases, one of which contains millions of francs, passing from hand to hand! Is it really possible to make sense of such wild confusion? As that crazy day ends, Barnier thinks he has achieved the impossible. But has he really?</p>
<p>Neurotic businessman must find the right man for his pregnant daughter. In fact, it is little bit complicated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film that almost killed my friend R-G, from an overdose of laughs, "Oscar" has a special place in my cinema loving mind, not because it is original or something, but because it's so damn good!The best big screen version of a theatrical play, (Sylvester Stallone didn't do too bad, but when you compare with Louis de Funès you are doomed to loose!) it practically takes place inside a house, during one day. The confusion that is created by a series of misunderstandings, carries you away and makes you feel compassion for the desperation of Louis de Funès, during the breaks you take from laughing, in order to breath.Sorry for my enthusiasm, but I like this one a lot. I know that opinions vary, but in my opinion, "Oscar" is one of the best comedies ever made, mostly for the amount of funny situations it serves you throughout the entire film.8)</p>
