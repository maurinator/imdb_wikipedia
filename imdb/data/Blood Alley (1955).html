<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nobody does John Wayne as good as John Wayne. But in 'Blood Alley' Wayne didn't even portrait himself well. He seemed bored through out the movie, failing to give anything better than an average performance. Maybe he knew the script was weak. I certainly felt no interest in the characters or what they were doing, maybe Wayne didn't either. Too bad because it seemed like a good premise for a movie.You do get to see Lauren Bacall in color. However she didn't get to do much of anything interesting. Nobody really does.One good point, the film is directed by William Wellman who goes back to the silent film era and directed such monumental films as 'The Public Enemy', 'The Ox Bow Incident' and 'A Star is Born' 1937 version, which he also wrote. And another good point is that it was shot in CinmaScope with glorious 'Warner Color', looks good. And don't forget the actual footage shot at the graveyard of ships, which was cool.Not a classic, but a worthy diversion.</p>
