<h1>Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After "The Poseidon Adventure", in which the ship got flipped over by a tidal wave, the ship drifts bottom-up in the sea. While the passengers are still on board waiting to be rescued, two rivaling salvage parties enter the ship on search for money, gold and a small amount of plutonium.</p>
<p>Adventurers return to the overturned ship, seeking a fortune.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen a film try to be so serious, yet I mistook it for a comedy. The performances were hilarious, the dialogue was awful, and for the life of me, I don't remember the music, so THAT must have been really bad!! LOL. Another one of those great Irwin Allen films that are filled with hammy actors and bad special effects--but what a fun time to watch!!</p>
