Eventually they're threatened by the mob.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first half of "Hot Stuff" is definitely better than what follows. Dom DeLuise, Jerry Reed, Susan Pleshette, and Luis Avalos, open a pawn shop, specifically to receive stolen items. The nice assortment of quirky characters, and their bizarre goods, being delivered into the hands of police officers is funny. What happens is they eventually run out of money, and have to start selling off the hot items to make ends meet. Unfortunately a "Godfather" element completely misfires, as does most of the remainder of the film. There is enough here to recommend a watch, just don't expect the comedy to hold up through the entire movie. - MERK</p>
