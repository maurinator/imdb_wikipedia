<h1>A Foreign Field (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Amos and Cyril are a pair of British veterans from WWII, going back to Normandy 50 years after D-Day to visit an old buddy's grave. There, they run into Waldo, an American WWII vet. And both Waldo and Cyril run into a French woman they were both enamored of in their soldiering days and begin squabbling over her. Waldo's son and daughter-in-law are putting up with him and each other. And the entire group meet up with a woman who has come to visit the grave of her brother. Together, they form an odd camaraderie, bound by the past as they share their memories</p>
<p>Veterans return to Normandie on the 50th anniversary of D Day for their own special and poignant reasons, among them two looking for an old love who turns out to the same woman for both.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although made by the BBC, frustratingly this hasn't been released on DVD in the UK and strangely never repeated on the BBC. A story of ordinary veterans returning to the scene of extraordinary events that had a lasting effect on their lives. All seven leads play their roles fantastically well but undoubtedly the star is Alec Guinness with a six word performance that mesmerises. It is very British in it's restraint and of course excels at pathos. I'm not a crier but I find it hard not to let a tear or six escape while watching this. Never was a jam jar put to better use. Now for god's sake, BBC, release it on DVD in the UK!</p>
