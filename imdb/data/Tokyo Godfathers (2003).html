<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Satoshi Kon's atypical holiday tale deals with our three main  vagabonds and a choice deeply affecting them.  Despite what level in life you find yourself, humans share similar basic emotions or feelings.  For Gin, Hana, and the less than cheery Miyuki, an unexpected find makes them confront their past whether they like it or not.  Memories flow bringing times of happiness, regret, pain, and questions of what could've been.  There's a great character richness in this darker, grimier side of Tokyo, but Kon also manages to put in lots of random, humorous events especially by cameos from minor citizens.   Plus, how could you not laugh with Hana's feminine wiles and that manly voice!  There's a strong sense of karma here with "what goes around comes around".  Doing nice things and you most likely will be rewarded.  However, turn your back or refusing to help someone in need may come back to haunt you when you are stuck with no one to turn to.  Hey, maybe it's never too late to learn a lesson, no matter how much it hurts.  Satoshi Kon's not presenting an Aesop's fable here, but like in life, sometimes doing a good deed is the best reward in itself.</p>
