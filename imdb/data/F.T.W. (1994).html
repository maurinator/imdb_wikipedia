<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>F.T.W. Is an very good movie, this movie makes you think. If any book you've rad yesterday makes you think about the context of it today, it means the writer have achieved his goal. He brought the idea in exact wright manner to move you, to make you think about it, to make your brain chew the theme, maybe even to change your views. Same goes for the movies. And this is an kind of a movie that makes difference, probably this is one of the best M.R. movies. I don't want my "movie-hero" to use a gun, or be cool. All this naive state of being cool is temporally, Pulp Fiction is not cool. Cool means stable state of emotions, or mental condition, to be able to have under control the negative reactions that may accure. If your "movie-hero" using F word and every two minutes reloads his gun, he is sick person and needs medical attention and that ain't cool. In this movie FTW lost his years in prison, after his release he decided to move on and leave the past behind. Emotionaly and mentally he require full recharge of his lost strength. You can witness him being cool, emotionally balanced person. He had all his reasons to use every second the "cool" F word or kill every cop in this movie trying to be die hard outlaw. But I guess it is much harder not to do that. I actually grew-up with the movies like Desperate hours, Barfly, F.T.W. Angel Heart, Johnny handsome etc I guess I saw all his movies, but I've lost my respect for this actor after I've forced my self to finish watching Exit in red, and then Point Blank. I had bad feeling that MR needed so badly money for a new operation, so he was willing to make any movie just to make another buck to get another face-lift done. Sorry MR I love your early work... But please find out for your self and make your own judgment</p>
