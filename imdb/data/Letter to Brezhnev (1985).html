<h1>Letter to Brezhnev (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two Soviet sailors, Peter and Sergei, go ashore in Liverpool to spend one night on the town. Peter can speak a minimal amount of English but it's enough to make contact with two Liverpudlian natives, Elaine and Theresa. Elaine and Peter immediately fall in love with each other, but the night is short and they must leave with the ship. Elaine can't forget him and writes a letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, asking him to make it possible for them to reunite.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Taking place during the 'Cold War' the film describes two people falling in love during a time of massive unemployment and recession in the U.K. The main characters are Elaine and Theresa, two friends who are very different from each other. Elaine is unemployed, bored of her own life and the people around her. Theresa works in a chicken factory and is the opposite of Elaine  she tries to enjoy life, in her own way which involves drinking, having casual sex and taking opportunities when they arise. Elaine and Theresa meet two Russian sailors in a nightclub and Elaine falls in love with the shyer one  Peter  and after he gets back on his ship she decides to go to Communist Russia to be with him, but it doesn't seem so easy to do. In the 1980's there was a big difference between the countries on either side of the 'Iron Curtain'. There was seen to be more freedom in the Capitalist West than the Communist East. The film shows the negative side of the lives of independent, 'free' women in the West; it tries to show that life in the West at that time was not what we are led to believe. Although we do not see life in Russia in the film, we are told there is work for all people there. For Elaine, Russia represents a happy life, a new start and hope for a job and a family. The film also shows the attitudes of the British to Russia, where they say there is no freedom and that Elaine may lose the opportunity to come back to her country. In my opinion, this film is propaganda for Russia as the director shows us the way that the British government constructed their own propaganda against Russia. Throughout the film the director shows us why life in the U.K. is no better, or may be worse, than life in Russia. We don't know if Elaine will be happier in Russia but she will have followed her heart and dreams.</p>
