<h1>The Land Girls (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During World War II, the organisation "The Women's Land Army" recruited women to work on British farms while the men were off to war. Three such "land girls" of different social backgrounds - quiet Stella, young hairdresser Prue, and Cambridge graduate Ag - become best friends in spite of their different backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is England in 1941 in the glorious Dorset countryside. Three beautiful young women, Stella, Ag and Prue, arrive on a remote farm. They are the 'Land Girls' - city girls who have volunteered to take the place of young men who have gone to war. They are an unlikely trio: Prue is vivacious and sexy; Ag is quiet and more reserved; while the dreamy, beautiful Stella is in love with Philip, a dashing naval officer. Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.</p>
<p>Three young women from very different walks of life join the women's land army during World War II and are sent to work together on a farm in Dorset and the experience changes their lives forever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Being English might have had something to do with it, but I loved this film. All the acting was outstanding and the multitude of little comic moments had me laughing much more than other 'comedies' that we get from hollywood. Although the central theme of the plot - an unlikely love affair - was a little unbelievable and forced, the gentle pace and quaint bizarre moments, and the refreshing setting made this a view again movie. Weiss character was a little ott at first but she played it beautifully with a surprising comic ability. As for the unintelligible accents, well I suggest that the American market which struggles to understand anything not US formulaic mass media, grows up.</p>
