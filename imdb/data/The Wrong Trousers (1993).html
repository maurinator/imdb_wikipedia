<h1>The Wrong Trousers (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Plasticine animation of Wallace and Gromit, inventors of all manner of useful devices. Gromit (a dog) finds himself being pushed out of his room and home by a new lodger who is actually a ruthless criminal (and a small penguin). The penguin is planning a robbery and needs to use Wallace and his mechanical remote controlled trousers to pull off the raid. However, Gromit is wise to the penguin and comes to the rescue.</p>
<p>Wallace is used by a criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Together with 'Wallace & Gromit: A Close Shave' and 'Wallace & Gromit: A Grand Day Out' this is one of the funniest things I have seen. The clay animation looks great, the stories are very ingenious and the jokes are great. If you get a chance to see this, please do so. You will have a great time.I guess this one is the best from the three, although 'A Close Shave' comes close. You must see all three of them anyway, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
