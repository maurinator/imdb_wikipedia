<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first Star Wars movie was the best although it's easy to become interested in the characters and want to know what happens next. The sequel, "The Empire Strikes Back" was well liked although it gave "evil" the upper hand. And now this movie,"The Return of the Jedi" is corny but with a positive, hopeful ending. Where they really went wrong is when they changed the ending. When first released, the end showed the "ghosts" of Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. They were portrayed as seen in the film. After the prequels were released, they changed the actor from Sebastian Shaw to Hayden Christiansen. Bad move. So if they did this, why didn't they change Obi Wan to Ewan MacGregor? I think they should have left well enough alone. I had to go get an old VHS copy of the movie to see it as it was originally filmed. Just because you CAN change something because of technology doesn't mean you should. They should have left it alone.</p>
