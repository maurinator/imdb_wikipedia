<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Charles Bronson is an ex-patriot of the United States who travels to the Yukon to escape his past.  He gets on the bad side of a group of trappers, kills one of them in self-defense, and is wrongfully accused of murder. Lee Marvin as a veteran Mountie, Carl Weathers, and fresh from training Mountie Andrew Stevens set out to track Bronson down as he tries to escape into Alaska.The acting in this film is sensational, the settings are true to life, and the story is riveting.  A must see!</p>
