<h1>Kill Me Later (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Shawn Holloway has a miserable life since she was eleven, when her father left her mother and she stayed alone with her problematic mother. Presently she is graduated, works in a bank and is the mistress of her married colleague Matthew Richmond. When she finds that Matthew's wife is pregnant, she decides to commit suicide. She goes to the roof of the building, drinks some vodka, trying to get enough courage to jump to the floor. The neighbors see the scene and call the police to save Shawn. Meanwhile, the bank where she works is being robbed by Charlie Anders and two friends of him. When the cops arrive to save Shawn, the heist is in progress and the police shoot one robber, the driver escapes and Charlie runs to the top of the building. There, he does not allow Shawn to jump off and saves her. They make an agreement: she would help him to escape, and he would give US$ 50,000.00 to her and kill her later with a shot in the head.</p>
<p>Her goldfish dead, her lover exposed as a rat, Shawn Holloway leaves her bank post and goes to the roof intent on suicide. Before she can leap, she's taken hostage by Charlie Anders, a fleeing bank robber. He and his partners have stolen a million in cash and plan to escape to Venezuela. Shawn agrees to cooperate if Charlie promises to kill her once he's in the clear. Parts of the plan go awry, so Charlie has time to try to pierce her bleak manner and self pity, and she has time for reflection. As night falls, their interlude ends: they're each alone, Charlie facing prison as the police close in, and Shawn staring down at a river from atop a high bridge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Shawn Holloway (Selma Blair) has a miserable life since she was eleven, when her father left her mother and she stayed alone with her problematic mother. Presently she is graduated, works in a bank and is the mistress of her married colleague Matthew Richmond (D. W. Moffett). When she finds that Matthew's wife is pregnant, she decides to commit suicide. She goes to the roof of the building, drinks some vodka, trying to get enough courage to jump to the floor. The neighbors see the scene and call the police to save Shawn. Meanwhile, the bank where she works is being robbed by Charlie Anders (Max Beesley) and two friends of him. When the cops arrive to save Shawn, the heist is in progress and the police shoot one robber, the driver escapes and Charlie runs to the top of the building. There, he does not allow Shawn to jump off and saves her. They make an agreement: she would help him to escape, and he would give US$ 50,000.00 to her and kill her later with a shot in the head. "Kill me Later" is predictable but a good entertainment; however something is missing to be an excellent movie. There are action, black humor, romance and drama. There are excellent ironical dialogs and the story is very reasonable. Selma Blair is extremely beautiful and well dressed along this film. The black costumes fit very well to her beautiful face and elegant body. Her performance is also great, and there is some sort of chemistry between Shawn and Charlie. Unfortunately, the characters are not well developed. For example, why Charlie went to prison? Who is Charlie? Why Shawn, having a good job, dealing with loan, had not previously reimbursed her father, if this situation was bothering her so much? Why did she want to commit suicide? Just because of her relationship with Matthew and her problems with her parents along her adolescence period? How they escaped in the end of the movie, after jumping from the bridge with the police chasing them? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Mate-me Depois' ('Kill Me Later')</p>
