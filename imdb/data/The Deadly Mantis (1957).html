<h1>The Deadly Mantis (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The calving of an Arctic iceberg releases a giant praying mantis, trapped in suspended animation since prehistoric times. It first attacks military outposts to eat their occupants, then makes its way to the warmer latitudes of Washington and New York. A paleontologist works together with military units to try to kill it.</p>
<p>An attack on an arctic weather station and subsequently on a USAF transport plane have the Air Force puzzled. Their scientists can make little headway but Col. Joe Parkman enlists the aid of a paleontologist, Dr. Ned Jackson, who thinks he has the answer: the culprit is a giant praying mantis. The creature is traveling south at high speed and it's a race against time to capture or kill it. They get their chance when the creature is trapped in the Manhattan tunnel.</p>
<p>A giant prehistoric praying mantis, recently freed from the Arctic ice, voraciously preys on American military at the DEW Line and works its way south.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Say you like this movie if you thought it wasn't a complete waste of your time.  Seriously, folks, movies are largely just an assemblage of lies (including documentaries and biographies) strung together by some type of formulaic narrative strategy.  As Giant Monster Movies usually go, I've only two personal favorites: Japan's "War of the Gargantuas" and this one served up in the late '50s by America's Universal Studios.This lie (In real life, even prehistoric dragonflies didn't get half as large as this cinematic 'creation') is told effectively enough; for its time, it must have seemed infinitely impressive.So if you felt you had to say anything about DM, say enough good things about it as well...Serviceable special effects, especially when we get close-ups of the titular Praying Mantis, peeping in windows and a roar to match its size and density.  The monster has a special aversion to planes, trains and automobiles (all the miniature vehicles and sets met with my own personal 'satisfaction' standards).The overall production is marred slightly by the film's initial 'public service message,' warning us that atomic energy is bad (Duh!), and its piddling knowledge about North American ground control (yadda, yadda, so what!), the story's most interesting moments are repeatedly slowed down by long stretches of non-activity (through the use of time filling dialog and scenes that take you 'nowhere' in particular).In short, this would have made a fascinating half-hour production, with non-stop original thrills (Case in Point: the filmmakers in this one resisted showing a hyper-destructive opportunity when, as the flying monster alights on the Washington Monument, it doesn't destroy it; my guess is, it needed to rest its wings).  I must point out one error in DM: Although Mantis is supposed to be migrating due south, why is he heading north, from Washington, D.C. to New York City?I found the ending satisfactory (Watch for the modest, yet interesting false alarm!).</p>
