<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i saw this teen comedy at a drive-in double feature along with 'thank god its Friday',which had some of the same cast. lee Purcell as a snotty b**ch type,is devilishly sexy,as she was still a hot little fox,in the Nancy Allen vein. Didi conn plays the ugly duckling type,who becomes a swan,ala 'shes all that',she shows surprisingly,an incredible set of bazookies in a tight red gown during the prom scene,who would of thought that frenchie was such a sexpot?. john Friedrich,Tim matheson and Bruno Kirby,round out the cast of guy characters and 'the beach boys' mike love adds music. this movie also had the lovely actress 'sunny Johnson',who sadly in the early 80's would pass away quite young,she would go on to appear in 'national lampoon's animal house','the night the lights went out in Georgia' and 'flashdance'. i thought this movie was pretty good at the time and it obviously had a reliable cast,this movie should definitely be repackaged in a double DVD set along with 'shes all that',as they both have a lot in common.</p>
