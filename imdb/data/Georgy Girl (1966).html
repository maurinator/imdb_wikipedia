<h1>Georgy Girl (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A homely but vivacious young woman dodges the amorous attentions of her father's middle-aged employer while striving to capture some of the glamorous life of her swinging London roommate.</p>
<p>Georgy has resigned herself to being one of life's accidents. She disapproves somewhat of her father's butlering James Leamington. She's tall, plump, sloppy and wistfully envious of what she conceives to be the life led by her beautiful, but icy roommate. Where her roommate, Meredith, is cool and calculating, Georgy gets so involved with the people around her she behaves like an affectionate puppy. Most of all she burns to be a mother. But it is Meredith that is in the hospital having an unwanted child.</p>
<p>Twenty-two year old Georgina Parkin - Georgy to her friends - is a Plain Jane of a woman who beats to her own drummer. She grew up in the household of wealthy James Leamington, Georgy's parents being the household domestics. Middle aged Leamington, who had provided for Georgy's every need while she was growing up, offers Georgy a business proposition, all written in a formal contract: he will provide for her whatever she wants if she becomes his mistress. She never really directly provides him with an answer. Meanwhile, Georgy shares a flat with Meredith Montgomery, a beautiful but self absorbed woman. Partying all the time without him, Meredith is dating Jos Jones, who hangs around with Georgy while Meredith is out partying. Jos and Georgy have a good time together, Georgy who secretly loves her flatmate's boyfriend. Solely out of boredom, Meredith, who is pregnant with Jos' child, proposes she keep this one (she's previously had two abortions without much thought on the matter) and that she and Jos get married. The plan is for Jos to move into the flat, Georgy who is free to do as she pleases. As Meredith's pregnancy progresses and after the baby arrives, the life of Georgy, Jos and Leamington adjust to accommodate the change. By choice, Meredith's life is the one that doesn't.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this movie mostly for Lynn Redgrave, expecting nothing more than an old, light-hearted British comedy. It was better than I expected; "Georgy Girl" is a lovely, bittersweet dramedy clearly inspired by American screwball comedies of the 30's and the French New Wave that was burning in the 60's (to see how much the Nouvelle Vague aesthetics influenced British cinema, check the also remarkable "Two for the Road", with Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn).Redgrave, fantastic as usual, plays Georgy, a scatter-brained working-class virgin with a golden heart. She shares a flat with a selfish, cold bitch (Charlotte Rampling), who gets pregnant of Jos (Alan Bates), and the three of them eventually move together; but things get complicated as Georgy is courted by Jos and James (James Mason), a much older man, at the same time.Bates (is it just me, or does he look like Jean-Paul Belmondo - one of the greatest Nouvelle Vague icons because of Godard's "Breathless" - in this?), Rampling and Mason are all great in their respective parts, but this is Redgrave's show all the way. Her anti-heroine is sweet and memorable, somewhat similar to Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop (from "Muriel's Wedding"), some sort of a British, less patient and clumsier Am√©lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou). Georgy singing "Whole Lotta Woman" is a classic scene. Lynn's performance alone would make this movie worth seeing, but she's not the only good thing about it, just the core. 10/10.</p>
