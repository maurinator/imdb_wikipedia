<h1>Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young and restless Nick Adams, the only son of a domineering mother and a weak but noble doctor father, leaves his rural Michigan home to embark on an eventful cross-country journey. He is touched and affected by his encounters with a punch-drunk ex-boxer, a sympathetic telegrapher, and an alcoholic advancement for a burlesque show. After failing to get a job as reporter in New York, he enlists in the Italian army during World War I as an ambulance driver. His camaraderie with fellow soldiers and a romance with a nurse he meets after being wounded propel him to manhood.</p>
<p>An immature young man from Middle America grows to manhood after a cross-country journey and his military service in World War I.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film attempts to compile all or most of Hemingway's Nick Adams stories into one complete whole. The effect is a coming of age story that ends on a bitter/semi-sweet note. Along the way you see a series of stories populated by well known actors and actresses.There is a sequence that reminds one of Farewell to Arms (wounded ambulance driver falls in love with nurse, who eventually dies in his arms).There is the overbearing, controlling, religious mother and the anguished father (who eventually takes his own life).There is the hard boiled newspaper editor, who gives sound hard boiled advice.I liked the movie, but I am unsure whether I would recommend it to someone else.</p>
