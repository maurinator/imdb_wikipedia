<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw "My Pal Gus" many years ago, in Australia, but it is one of the movies that have remained in my memory ever since. I think the main reason I enjoyed this particular film was because it was so different from the usual roles that Richard Widmark played. This is one of the films that I would enjoy seeing again as it would be interesting to see how it has stood up to the "test of time". I particularly remember the scene at the kindergarten where the children were playing in the dirt, which culminated in Richard Widmark having a rather unusual taste treat, and some of the children had questions his character found difficult to answer. A really enjoyable film, without any bad language, torrid love scenes or violence - a great family film.</p>
