<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this on a late night television show and I fell deep, deep in love with it. Julius Vrooder is one of the most wonderful characters I've seen this far. He is witty, young, vulnerable and in love. The fact that the makers succeeded in making him both fun and sad is remarkable. Often the characters only have one side; they're funny, bored, stupid and so on, so on. But Julius Vrooder really shows the depth of a regular human being. That they also made a 100 minutes movie about a guy in a V.A mental hospital and his love for the nurse during a few days without making it a romantic comedy in the same genre as Pretty Woman and You've got mail is stunning. It's one of the first romantic comedies/dramas I've ever seen which contains love without making it sugar sweet with extra pink in it and I love it! The man (I forgot his name) who plays Julius is does also make a wonderful character of the paper. He is living in Vrooders small world with a depth that takes me away. I couldn't give this film a vote less than a ten!</p>
