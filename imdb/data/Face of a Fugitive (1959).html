<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While fans of "My Three Sons" and the Flubber films might not believe it, Fred MacMurray was the star of a wide variety of films up until the 1960s--romances, comedies, Film Noir and even Westerns. So I assume that an awful lot of people would be surprised to see a tough-as-nails version of Fred in FACE OF A FUGITIVE.The film begins with Fred being under arrest for bank robbery. However, he is in the process of escaping when his brother intervenes and shoots the deputy. Both the deputy and brother are killed in the process and Fred is assumed to be the guilty party--which he is not. So now he's not just on the run for robbery but murder.When he arrives in a far off town, no one there knows his identity. However, they have heard about the murder and are on the lookout for Fred. But, at least for a couple days, they don't have wanted posters, so they have no idea what he looks like. Unfortunately for Fred, he can't leave town because deputies have the roads out of town covered--in case this killer tries coming in or out of the city. So, he's stuck, at least for now, and begins to make friends in the town--particularly with a pretty lady as well as the sheriff.Overall, it is an exceptional western--even with "Steve Douglas" in the lead. I particularly like how it ended--it was exciting yet a bit vague--which I enjoyed. Good acting and a good script--this one is a keeper.</p>
