<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A by-the-numbers heist movie.You won't find anything innovative here.  A veteran thief looking for his "last job" so he can retire.  A young "know-it-all" thief.  The bankroller who brings it together.  The girlfriend who wants the veteran to retire.The roles are comfortable, the characters familiar.  At least they're acted well.  De Niro turns in one of the performances he *always* turns in of late.  He breezes through the scenes providing satisfactory drama but doing *nothing* memorable.  You will forget the character's name by the time the credits are done.Brando... I'm not sure why he was in this, other than to place him in a movie with De Niro.  He was fine as the money man but, given his legend, you just expect so much more.Norton did the best.  Maybe he's young enough to still give the extra effort and not just play the role adequately but try to breathe life into it as well.The job itself is also routine.  We have the valuable target.  The nearly impregnable holding spot.  The plans, the tunnels, the cameras.  *yawn* Oh well.  If you just need an evening movie to relax with, this will do. As I said, all elements (acting, story, direction) are fine and you won't feel like you've wasted your time.You also won't remember it tomorrow.5 out of 10.</p>
