<h1>Jawbreaker (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In what was meant as a harmless birthday prank, three of Reagan High School's most popular girls, Julie, Marcie, and Courtney pretend to kidnap their friend, the latter shoving a jawbreaker into the victim's mouth to keep her from screaming. Their plan goes awry when the girl accidentally swallows the jawbreaker, choking to death. The cool and calculating Courtney tries to cover the crime but is found out by school geek Fern Mayo. In return for her silence, Courtney transforms the gawky Fern into the stylishly beautiful Vylette, leaving the conscience-stricken Julie out in the cold, threatening to set her up for the girl's murder if she breaks her silence.</p>
<p>Meet Liz Purr: Friendly. Pretty. And popular. Flash-forward to the morning of her 17th birthday, and you'll find her being taken out of her bed, tied-up, and taken to the trunk of the car that her three best friend's (Courtney, Julie, and Marcie) are riding while being gagged with a jawbreaker. Everything goes terribly wrong as the 3 girls pop the trunk to find Liz dead, from choking on the rock hard candy. Courtney is a cold hearted bitch who could care less about the death of her best friend, but the chance of a ruined reputation. Marcy is like Courtney's shadow who will agree on anything Courtney says. And Julie is a good girl who wants to go to the police. But Julie gets a war when Courtney will do anything to cover the case up. And I mean ... anything.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A group of ultra-hip teenage schoolgirls (from Reagan High!) accidentally kill one of their own in a birthday prank gone awry; they struggle to keep their deed a secret even after a nerdy student discovers the truth. Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic "Heathers" knock-off. Holds interest nearly half the way, however the wrap-up is right off the assembly-line. It certainly benefits from a good cast, with the central performances by Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart spot-on, however prominently-billed P.J. Soles, William Katt and Marilyn Manson hardly appear at all. *1/2 from ****</p>
