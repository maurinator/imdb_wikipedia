<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dil ka rishta is a worth see for fans of aishwarya but for others it doesn't delivers too much. The pre-release hype rose expectations of viewers but apart from good performances by aishwarya (as tia) and arjun rampal (sa jai) the film fails to deliver much. The movie is about this guy jai who loves tia so much that even after around four years of their last meeting he drinks to fight with the memories of his first (and last) love. And finally when he decides to give  up the alcohol thing he crashes into tia's car. Tia loses her husband and guess what her memory (..phew). Any how first half keeps you interesting but the fate of the movie depends on the second half which is penned unimaginably. Predictably now tia is after jai and he cant reciprocate knowing the truth (and the presence of tia's mother). Somehow he describes the whole thing to tia (though Dr claimed it could cause her death..:() Anyhow arjun rampal has come up with a great performance while aishwarya has done her bit looking amazing sometimes and disappointing othertimes (esp in the song daiya daiya..). A lot of effort wasted i guess with a loose ending. The writer and the director should have culminated the story in a much more intriguing and efficient manner.</p>
