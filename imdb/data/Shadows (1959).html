<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Benny's a hipster, moving in and out of Manhattan's beat scene, aimless, maybe close to trouble. His sister Lelia, who looks less African-American than White, is vulnerable and about to fall in love. Hugh, their older brother, is a struggling singer whose agent, Rupert, may be the only person with faith in his talent. The story moves back and forth, like jazz, among the three of them and what seems at first to be separate lives. Lelia meets Tony, and lets herself hope this is true love. Then he meets Hugh and prejudice gives Tony an excuse to cut and run. Can family and friendship bring solace for her hurt, purpose for Benny, and belief in Hugh? Is life more than shadows?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 1959, came two films named Breathless and Shadows that would have an impact on World Cinema.  The former would begin a new era in French Cinema called the French New Wave.  The latter would change the face of Independant movie making.  Breathless was made by a man who was in love with the cinema and possessed quite a bit of knowledge about films.  Shadows was done by a man whose origins lies in the theatre.  Shadows(1959) came about because of John Cassavettes inability to find work as an actor during the 1950's.  His anger and frustration due to not finding work led to his first film as a director.  Shadows is about a couple of light black skin people who try to pass themselves as white in order to find acceptence.  The main actors play themselves in this groundbreaking feature.  The best scene of the film is when Lelia brings her boyfriend who is white to her brother's apartment and reveals to him that's she and her family are black.  It would have a tremendous effect on future directors like Martin Scorsese and the Coen Brothers.  The film's urban grittiness and the theme of guilt seems to be a predecessor to Martin Scorsese's breakthough classic Mean Streets(1973).  Shadows(1959) is the grandfather of Dogma95 as well as The Blair Witch Project(1999) and Timecode(2000).</p>
