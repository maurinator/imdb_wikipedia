<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent old revenge movie from a time when Britain still made movies that didn't involve period costumes or floppy haired smiles!Ian "Lovejoy" McShane and the Late Oliver Reed bust out of prison, with the sole purpose of killing Reeds Wife (Jill St John) who wants a divorce. The film is relentless in its portrayal of Reed as a cold blooded man with a single deadly purpose, yet still shows him simmering with a pent up violent rage that cant wait to explode into violence at any time. I have heard many call this movie a poor-mans version of "Get Carter", but that tag does it a serious injustice. Gritty, Dark, Bleak and Brutal (for its time) something about this movie keeps me watching it 30+ years after its release. Stylish, Original, and highly recommended, especially if you are sick of "Feel Good" cliches.</p>
