<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1982 film is supported by a great cast and film score by Bill Conti (Rocky, FX.)  Filmed largely in Dallas and Texas, this anti-cult film deals with basically the same subject as a Canadian film released the previous year. Ticket To Heaven (1981) also has a great cast and for me is a much more entertaining and realistic film.  TTH deals with the true story of a depressed young man getting caught up in the cult of Sun-Yung Moon, while Split Image portrays the identity crisis of a young man who is seeking answers beyond the sometimes shallow lives of his family and friends.  His confusion leads him to a new-age cult, where he finds the leader to be even more sinister and devoid of answers than those he runs away from.  While many of life's questions can be answered by the Bible, proper spiritual guidance and direction is essential, particularly for those who are not mature enough to seek God on their own.</p>
