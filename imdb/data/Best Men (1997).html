<h1>Best Men (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The film opens with 4 tuxedo clad men showing up at a penitentiary to meet a friend who has just been released after three years in prison and is going straight from the jail to marry his girl friend. En route to the wedding, one of the men asks to stop by a bank to pick up some cash. As it turns out, he is a wanted bank robber who uses Shakespeare passages during his robberies and thus has become known as "Hamlet". Soon all five men are caught up in the bank and involved in the robbery as they end up in a hostage situation. The hostage negotiator shows up who turns out to be Hamlet's father. As the men are all known to those being robbed, this quirky comedy takes a left turn as their hostages all work to support the men.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie tells us an interesting, unusual, and uneven tale of angst, love, disaffection, and friendship.  The groom, and four guys in the wedding party, are on their way to the wedding when one of them (who turns out to be the son of the town sheriff) decides to rob a bank, and all of them get involved.  It is hard to imagine a more bizarre start to a story.  The screenplay could have been a lot better; the characters could have been a lot better developed; the story could have been a lot more realistic.  But in spite of all that, each time I tried to turn it off, something happened that kept me going, all the way to the end!  There's a lot of movies that can't manage that trick.  I wouldn't spend a lot of money to see it, but on the other hand, if it turns up on cable, and you want a change of pace, it's definitely worth a try.  It might just hit you the right way.</p>
