<h1>The Boy Friend (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The assistant stage manager of a small-time theatrical company (Polly Browne) is forced to understudy for the leading lady (Rita) at a matinée performance at which an illustrious Hollywood director (Cecil B. DeThrill) is in the audience scouting for actors to be in his latest "all-talking, all-dancing, all-singing" extravaganza. Polly also happens to fall in love with the leading man (Tony) and imagines several fabulous fantasy sequences in which the director is free to exercise his capacity for over-the-top visuals in this charming 1920's era flick.</p>
<p>It's the beginning of the talking movie era. At the Theatre Royal in Portsmouth, England, a second rate theater troupe run by "Mr. Max" Mandeville is in its run of a musical called "The Boy Friend". For their shows, there are usually more people performing on stage than there are in the audience. On this day, the lead actress, Rita Monroe, has just injured her ankle, leaving the assistant stage manager, a shy waif of a woman named Polly Browne to assume the lead female role just before her first scheduled entrance. The timing is bad as in the audience for this matinée is famed Hollywood movie director De Thrill, who is scouting for his new all talking movie musical. So there is much pressure on Polly not just to perform adequately, but to save the production to ensure it pleases De Thrill. While many of the actors end up playing solely to De Thrill - especially featured chorus members Maisie and Tommy, who try to one up the other on stage - Polly only wants not to embarrass herself, and have real life mirror the on-stage story as she is in love with the lead actor, Tony Brockhurst.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As hilarious today as it was in 1971, this much loved comedy is probably to musicals what Blazing Saddles is to westerns. I know that might sound odd but the analogy describes how much of a very funny send up of Busby Berkeley musicals and wobbly British seaside theatre this film really is. I saw the longer 139 min version in a 1997 reissue in Australia, and it actually is not as tidy as the shorter 109 min version originally released, It is too excessive and impromptu (cast laughing etc) whereas the shorter version does work better. However it does allow for 2 more songs and some extras in the dance numbers that you will want to see... Twiggy is gorgeous, the art direction superb and the end result hilarious and charming. Interestingly it was made because MGM fumbled the possibility of a straight stage reworking with Julie Andrews (she made Thoroughly Modern Millie instead), and by 1968 the world went to hell in the Vietnam war and street riots. The Boyfriend has aged well, and so has Twiggy. Alert viewers will see some of the same clothes previously in Women In Love because Shirley Russell used to buy the real 1920s garments from London markets and used them in several films her husband made. BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS is a good 2003 equivalent in art direction and style.</p>
