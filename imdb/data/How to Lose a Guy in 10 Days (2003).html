<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this movie was refreshingly funny. In a time where there is so much violence and nastiness going on in the world, it is great to see a film that just wants to make people laugh. What is wrong with that. It didn't hurt that Kate is just as funny if not funnier than her mom (good genes) and Matthew should be credited for his great sense of humor. He is also really nice to look at. Had to be said! I loved this movie. The supporting cast was also excellent. Adam Goldburg can play a straight man better than anyone. Michael Michelle, as the rival to Matthews character, made me want to scratch her eyes out. Of course I have to mention Bebe Neuwirth, she's as always amazing to watch on screen and on stage. RENT THIS MOVIE. IT'S WORTH THE $4.00.</p>
