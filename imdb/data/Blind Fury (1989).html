Now, hell-bent on getting out of this nightmare and returning home, Parker must find a way to survive in the jungles before the Vietcong arrive.Without his ability to see, Parker must rely on his remaining senses to guide him out of dangerous perils.BLIND FURY is a surprisingly serviceable action film. This flick is a fast-paced and fun adventure with raging fury.  BLIND FURY contains impressively choreographed fighting sequences and a great, tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. There's plenty of violence in this film to appease action fans, however, and the stunts and action sequences are certainly directed with flair. The comical tones also remind the audience that this film, though full of bellicose characteristics, is good natured and harmless.As for the villains, Randall 'Tex' Cobb (UNCOMMON VALOR) is a nice addition as a wonderfully sinister, antagonistic philistine.  Sho Kosugi also performs a dazzling, show-stealing act. He happens to be a professional assassin with a vendetta against Parker.BLIND FURY is a commendable adventure with an unconventional hero. Exquisite sword-fighting, dynamite action, a likeable lead, and an amusing albeit subtle sense of humor all add up to an enjoyable experience.  It is definitely better than your typical action fanfare with plenty of chances to root for the good guys! Cutting edge entertainment with good natured fun. Overall, a smoothly crafted film.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.</p>
