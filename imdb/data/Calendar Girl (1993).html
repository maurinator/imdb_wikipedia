<h1>Calendar Girl (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Like many adolescent boys, Roy Darpinian had the hots for movie divas, and one in particular was his wet dream as half of America's in the 1950s: Marilyn Monroe. The difference is, one summer holiday he actually decided to enlist his spineless buddies, Scott Foreman and Ned Bleuer, to actually drive all the way to Hollywood and make as many desperate attempts as it takes to meet her or get arrested trying, and no setback or embarrassment (even publicly bare-ass) can stop or distract him. Against all odds, he finally even got a chance to help her...</p>
<p>Three young men go on an end of the summer trip to Hollywood, CA. Their quest: to fulfill the fantasy of meeting Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 1962 UCLA, Ned Bleuer (Gabriel Olds) is alone as he recalls his adolescent with his best friends. Their dream girl Marilyn Monroe has just been fired from 'Something's Got to Give'. Roy Darpinian (Jason Priestley) is a hustler working with the Gallo brothers (Kurt Fuller, Stephen Tobolowsky) and about to go to Army boot camp. One-legged Scott Foreman (Jerry O'Connell) is getting married. Ned is wasting his life in a toy store. Roy convinces the guys to go on a road trip to meet Marilyn.The guys lack chemistry. It feels like the characters are slam together while the narration drones on. It needs more scenes of the group together before they go on the mission. Priestley is seriously annoying. Olds is bland. O'Connell has little to do. This is a superficial group with little to offer. Their mission is boring. It takes a long time before the movie shows any heart. It's not funny. It has little charm.</p>
