<h1>Flamenco (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As a hall fills with performers, a narrator says that flamenco came from Andalucia, a mix of Greek psalms, Mozarabic dirges, Castillian ballads, Jewish laments, Gregorian chants, African rhythms, and Iranian and Romany melodies. The film presents thirteen rhythms of flamenco, each with song, guitar, and dance: the up-tempo bularías, a brooding farruca, an anguished martinete, and a satiric fandango de huelva. There are tangos, a taranta, alegrías, siguiriyas, soleás, a guajira of patrician women, a petenera about a sentence to death, villancicos, and a final rumba. Families present numbers, both festive and fierce. The camera and the other performers are the only audience.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This brilliant work by Carlos Saura is a marvel to view.The lighting of the simple sets is stunning while the performers show the development and the history of the flamenco.The music, the dancing and as said before the lighting of the sets are breathtaking. An other companion film to watch would be Carmen by Carlos Saura one of my all time favorites. In Flamenco I would have liked to have seen a little more pair-dancing.</p>
