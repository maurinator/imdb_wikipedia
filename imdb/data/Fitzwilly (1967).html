<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dick Van Dyke comedy that relies more on sophisticated comedy than slapstick.  Van Dyke plays a sophisticated and proper butler.  The old woman he works for is penniless but he keeps this from her allowing her to believe that she is rich and can give thousands of dollars to charities, which she does.  The butler is also quite an educated brain and forms the household staff into a Robin Hood band which steals from the rich (namely insurance companies paying off department store thefts) to give to the old woman who in turn turns it over to the charities (minus household expenses).  It is all rather organized and quite reminiscent in many ways to the butler role in "Candleshoe" and the gang in "Who's Minding the Mint," without the slapstick.  Van Dyke is perfectly cast as the butler thief with good intentions who would do anything to make the woman happy.  Barbara Feldon (99 of "Get Smart") arrives as the new secretary upsetting both the criminal acts and the private world of Van Dyke who seemingly for the first time gathers a love interest for someone besides the old woman.  Rated G and briskly paced, but a little talky for kids used to Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  A neat film for those that love 1960's comedy and Dick Van Dyke.</p>
