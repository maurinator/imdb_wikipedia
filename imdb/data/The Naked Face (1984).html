<h1>The Naked Face (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Chicago psychiatrist Judd Stevens (Roger Moore) is suspected of murdering one of his patients when the man turns up stabbed to death in the middle of the city. After repeated attempts to convince cops Rod Steiger and Elliott Gould of his innocence, Dr.Stevens is forced to go after the real villains himself, and he finds himself up against one of the city's most notorious Mafia kingpins.</p>
<p>Rimasto drammaticamente colpito negli affetti più cari, uno psicanalista è stranamente coinvolto in alcuni delitti: prima viene ucciso un suo paziente, poi la sua segretaria. Capisce quindi che qualcuno vuole distruggerlo, forse per vendicarsi di lui.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I really liked Elliott Gould's (Stand-In/Double) Richard Slamp. He was excellent and made the movie worth seeing. I would like to see him in more films. Roger Moore is a great actor and I have enjoyed him starting in his early days as "The Saint". Rod Steiger is so intense...he is one of the best actors of his day. It's too bad that this film didn't get the screen coverage it deserved, it would have been a big hit. This film is rather dark and depressing, but the topic of the movie calls for this type of background. There are some very good shots of the beautiful city of Chicago in this movie. This film has several of my favorite actors in it and that in itself makes it a very interesting watch for me. Art Carney (Norton), Elliott Gould (Mash), Roger Moore (The Saint and 007) Rod Steiger (Some like it hot, etc), David Hedison (Voyage under the sea), and Rick Slamp (Elliot's Stand-in and Double) This movie has some negative comments about Gays. This may be one of the reasons it didn't make it. All-in-All it was a pretty good film and I would suggest you pick up a copy and give it a View.</p>
