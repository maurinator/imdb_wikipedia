<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fascinating old-fashioned spy thriller with (for the 80s) new high tech elements. Pierce Brosnan is very good as the smiling sociopathic Russian deep cover agent. Michael Caine is, well, Michael Caine. Ian Richardson has a lot of WONDERFUL lines as Caine's superior. Ray McNally and Ned Beatty are fine as old Cold War veterans whose time is passing.</p>
