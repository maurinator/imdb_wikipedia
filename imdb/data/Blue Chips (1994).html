<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is very underrated, it hasn't gotten nearly the credit it deserves.  I thought it was very well done, although it wasn't perfect, it was still very good.  It is the first movie to talk about a problem that is very prominent in todays colleges and their methods of recruiting.  The film is very well written and Nick Nolte does a great, great job playing the conflicted coach.</p>
