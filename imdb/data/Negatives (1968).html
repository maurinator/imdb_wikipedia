<h1>Negatives (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Theo, a used-furniture dealer, and his lover, Vivien, like to enhance their love-making through dressing-up and role-playing. He pretends he's notorious murderer Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen; she pretends she's either Crippen's wife, Belle Elmore, or Crippen's mistress, Ethel Le Neve. When they're not having sex, Theo and Vivien engage in a lot of bickering, but continue to live together above Theo's London shop. Entering their lives one day is Reingard, a female German photographer who's been observing the couple, whom she finds intriguing. Reingard moves into one of the rooms above the shop; under her influence, Theo begins to shed his Crippen persona in favor of that of another notorious figure, German flying ace Baron von Richthofen, a development which threatens to impact Theo's relationship with Vivien.</p>
<p>A couple's bizarre romantic relationship is disrupted by the intrusion of a third person.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Strange doesn't begin to describe this film, which features three of the coldest, most unpleasant movie characters I've seen in some time - which wouldn't necessarily be bad in itself, if only the characters were more interesting. None commands our sympathy; not the passive/aggressive Theo, nor the contemptuous Vivien, nor the enigmatic Reingard. Basically, "Negatives" is the story of a selfish, ineffectual man who exchanges one pathetic fantasy role for another.  "Peanuts" fans will recall how Snoopy, imagining himself to be a World War I flying ace, sat atop his doghouse, pretending it was a Sopwith Camel; Theo's embrace of Baron von Richthofen reaches an even more ludicrous height (both figuratively and literally). Director Peter Medak's deliberate pacing makes you feel as though there is some Great Meaning invested in this movie. My question is: What on earth is it?</p>
