<p>Screen Directors Playhouse: Tom and Jerry (1955) ** (out of 4) Tom (Peter Lawford) and Jerry (Nancy Gates) are a couple on the verge of divorce due to the husband being seen with another woman. A priest (Frank Fay) tries to get them back together but it doesn't work and soon the two are in a court in Las Vegas waiting for a judge (Arthur Q. Bryan) to sign the papers. Considering some of the talent involved you can't help but consider this episode somewhat of a dud. It's meant to mix comedy and drama but it falls flat on its face in regards to both. This entire series was set up so that screen directors could do any story they wanted and it should be noted that Leo McCarey selected this one because it was written by his daughter and it turned out to be the only thing she'd every write. It's easy to see because there's really nothing good here as the story goes in and out in terms of going after laughs one second and then trying to be dramatic the next. The idea that the wife should "stand by her man" even though he has been unfaithful will probably sit wrong with some viewers and the sentimental ending is a major crash and burn because it simply doesn't work. Both Lawford and Gates fit their roles well enough but I'd be lying if I said either one was great. The one note worthy thing is that the judge was played by Arthur Q. Bryan who is best known for being the voice of Elmer Fudd. This was the first time I had ever seen him on screen and it was rather amazing at how much he really did sound like Fudd.</p>
