<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In search of some adventure in their safe and peaceful valley, the five dinosaur friends make a hideaway. From there, they spot two thieves in action, stealing an egg from one of their broods. They chase them down and manage to recover the egg without its parents noticing, but in the process, accidentally create an opening into the valley, allowing two dreaded Sharptooths in. Everyone must fight them off together to preserve their peaceful way of life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alright, so the original was a little on the cute side, but it had a sense of wonder, of youthful innocence and to cut a long story short was a moving tale of love, friendship and courage.However, Part 2 is no more than a Disney-style cartoon, cute and twee through-and-through.  There's no real sense of awe or danger - it's more like a day in the life of a young dinosaur.  Any kind of reality is crushed by the unwise inclusion of some insufferably bad songs.  There is a cute baby T-Rex, but his parents lack the presence of the T-Rex in the first film.  Other hazards include two egg-stealing Struthiomimids who, in the tradition of the most melodramatic cartoon villains, have ex-public schoolboy accents.  Very silly.There are moments when the film starts showing promise - the swamp scene, the journey into the Mysterious Beyond, but overall it's just a let-down. See the original instead, and if you've seen it then go straight to Part 3 of this series.  Only undemanding kids will find anything of interest in this harmless, twee film.</p>
