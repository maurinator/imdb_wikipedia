<h1>Wide Sargasso Sea (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young female landowner in 1840s Jamaica marries a just-arrived Englishman to avoid losing her property. All seems to be perfect, love arises, and happiness is on the way, but she is hiding an old secret regarding her childhood and her mother. Slowly, this secret begins to erode this perfect relationship and, perhaps, her mother's story will begin again...with her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think reading the book helps the viewer appreciate the movie. The movie is a pretty faithful adaptation to the novel. The movie tells the story of the crazy wife in the attic in Jane Eyre. Not only does it tell her story, but it gives an entirely believable explanation for her insanity. Not only is the scenery beautiful, but the story is as well. Set in Jamaica during colonial times, we see a young woman grow up in a unique society. It is easy to sympathize with the multi-layered characters. Karina Lombard is a great choice to play Antoinette. There isn't that much to the story, at least not in the way of events. The story is deep, though. It's definitely worth a watch, and if you can spare an afternoon, read the book- it's very short.</p>
