<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I gave this movie a 7.  I would have given it a 9 but a couple scenes of full nudity were not needed at all!  That was disappointing to say the least.  Great film work and the acting was very good!  I thought that this was one of Smits' best roles.  He was amazing.  Especially the scene where the students wrote on his chalk board!  That was incredible!</p>
