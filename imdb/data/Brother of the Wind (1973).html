<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A story about an old man who rescues five wolf cubs from their den, when he finds that their mother wolf has been shot and killed by hunters in an aeroplane. I must have only been about 7 or 8 years old, the first time I watched this film, we had a recorded copy of this film from the TV, but I don't know whatever happened to it. This film was amazing and I would love to be able to buy it on DVD. Remember the raccoon family trying to cross the river? or the four wolf cubs learning to catch fish? This film will make you laugh and cry, especially at the end when the four wolf cubs come back to rescue the old man from a grizzly bear. This is without a doubt, a totally wonderful film!</p>
