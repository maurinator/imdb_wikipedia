<h1>Rain Without Thunder (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's the year 2042 and the threat is real...women are going to prison for terminating their pregnancies. An investigating reporter is determined to reveal the truth behind the convictions.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just saw (2013 Aug 4) this film on broadcast TV so it may have been trimmed. I liked the way the film is portrayed as a documentary. I read some early reviews and did not see the production problems described. The writer did not really push their leaning toward pro-life or pro-abortion, I felt there seemed to be more pro-abortion persons "interviewed". I think the pro-life side was not well represented, maybe because today (15 years later) we know more about women's mental and physical health after abortion. Today the Catholic church doesn't want to persecute but to show a true love for life. Mike L.</p>
