<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Go to Mars" has been unfairly maligned as Abbott and Costello's worst film.  A careful comparison to "Mexican Hayride" or "Dance With Me, Henry" would certainly prove this point.  While it doesn't rate in their Top 10, "Go to Mars" has many funny and wonderful moments.Among the great gags: Costello asking Abbott for a nickel to go through the Lincoln Tunnel; The Statue of Liberty ducking out of the way of the rocket.  Costello's reactions to space flight are also funny.What drags the film down for me in the rankings are the following two items.  First, the "space map" the rocket scientist uses to point out Venus and Mars; How can he find the two small planets among numerous pictures of large galaxies?  If the map were accurate, Venus and Mars would not be in the Solar System, they would be two stars between galaxies!  If these nitwits were in charge of the space program we would have never gotten to the moon!  Second, the last 20 or so minutes are rushed compared to the rest of the film.  It seems that in no time at all, Costello has gone from a prisoner on Venus to king.  And then, just as quickly, is dethroned.  This portion of the film is over too quickly, especially considering the bevy of Venus beauties we get to see!Take a quick look: that's Harry Shearer of "The Simpsons" and "Spinal Tap" fame in an uncredited role as a boy at the orphanage early in the film.  Not their best, but certainly not their worst.  6 out of 10.</p>
