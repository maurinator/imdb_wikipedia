<h1>Disclosure (2013)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>To avoid a euthanasia trial, Kim counted on Sam, her lawyer on practice partner Jacob Pollock's willingness to present as if solid a 'presumed' alibi, but Sam's truthful testimony plays in his mother's hand, like seemingly friendly police detective Anthony Newsome's, and Kim refuses to lie along. Cued by Josslyn that Savi received paternity test results but locked them away, Harry tries to get access in hospital, in vain despite charming the receptionist. Richard Grieco and April agree to 'just a lay date', but agree afterward both want to resume dating properly. Olivier is amused by Josslyn's routine in taking clients to nightclubs, her lesbian partner suddenly terribly jealous when she learns they slept together.</p>
<p>Harry goes to the clinic to find out the results of the paternity test.</p>
