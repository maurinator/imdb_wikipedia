<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>it had been many years since,The Wild Ones had been made with Brando.Hollywood disdained biker movies,there for, good writers were not going to have their name linked to one.the actors in this made it on a lark.they went to party and have fun.they knew they wasn't making any sort of an epic.but in a way they did.people who went to see this didn't care about the script or story line.this was a movie made with people from their generation,and not the same Hollywood old guard.so in many ways this started a trend in Hollywood of making movies,for the young adults,that wasn't Frankie and Annete on the beach.I personally like this movie,and see it to just have fun,not to learn any thing.I know the story is b.s.but it's got bikes,babes, partying,and dudes acting like horse's asses,how can you go wrong?</p>
