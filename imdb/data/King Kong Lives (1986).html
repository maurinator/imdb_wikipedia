<h1>King Kong Lives (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A giant ape King Kong, which was shot and fell off the World Trade Center tower, appears to be alive, but is in coma for 10 years and desperately needs a blood transfusion in order to have an artificial heart implanted. Suddenly, in the rainforest, another gigantic ape is found - this time a female. She is brought to the USA, and the heart is successfully implanted. But then King Kong, having sensed the female ape, breaks loose.</p>
<p>Kong falls from the twin towers and he appears to be alive. However, his heart is failing, so it's replaced with an artificial one. All is well until he senses that there's a female Kong somewhere out there and escapes wreaking havoc.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kong is back and this time it's personal! lol! This flick is a blast for B movie fans and those of us who love monsters! The rest of you will hate it. I love this! Linda Hamilton shines here and there's plenty of humor, action, gator munchin', redneck chompin', and tank smashin' fun! A poster for this one said that "America's biggest hero" was back..."and he's not happy"! That's the truth! When the human bad guys mess with the King's lady he's one big furry fury and nobody does it like The King does it people! I love this for all the reasons others hate it. It's a hoot! King Kong Lives delivers the goods when you are in one of those moods to enjoy fun cheese featuring a big romantic monkey with a mechanical heart rippin' assh*les in half and smashin' 'em to kindom come. This is the ONLY film to watch when you are in that type of mood folks. There's really no other film like it! Way to go big fella! ALL HAIL THE KING!</p>
