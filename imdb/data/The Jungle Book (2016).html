<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Review: This movie certainly looked spectacular but it didn't have the same impact like the original film, which didn't have a large budget, or technology. It proves that it's impossible to duplicate Walt Disney's vision and amazing storytelling methods, which has touched people around the world of all ages. The mixture of true life and CGI worked extremely well in this film but it's not upbeat like the original, which is also known for it's brilliant music, and I found it hard to connect to the various characters. Neel Sethi (Mowgli), played his role extremely well, and I have to give him recognition because it must have been hard to interact with characters that aren't really there but the songs popped up in weird places and it lacked the fun aspect, that we all loved from the original. Its still a joy to watch, and I'm sure that the kids will love it but I've got a feeling that people will still be going back to the original film. I have to commend the director, for taking on such a massive task but I personally think that he should have worked more on the storyline than the visual experience. On the plus side, the actors who were chosen for the voices, we're spot on and Bill Murray (Baloo), added some, much needed, humour to the movie. I just think that it's time for some new story lines, and that people should stop trying to bring back the magic from the old time classics. Watchable!Round-Up: With such a big task, I'm not surprised that this movie cost so much to make, and judging by the box office takings, Walt Disney's original concepts, are still pulling in audiences around the world. Jon Favreau, 49, took on the huge task of portraying Mowgli's amazing journey in the wild, and with another Jungle Book movie in the pipeline, he certainly impressed the big wigs in Hollywood. With movies like Elf, Zathura, Iron Man 1 & 2, the awful Cowboys & Aliens and Chef under his belt, along with a successful acting career, his enthusiasm for film is what has pushed him to new heights, especially with the success of the Iron Man movies. He certainly achieved a new type of movie making with this movie but the original was much better, in my eyes.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $964millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their family/adventure/dramas, starring Neel Sethi, and with the voices by, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, Garry Shandling and Jon Favreau. 6/10</p>
