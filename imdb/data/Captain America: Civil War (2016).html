<h1>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spiderman) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Sharon Carter, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges.</p>
<p>SPOILER: When politicians and world leaders think that people like Captain America and Iron Man are running amok, they tell them they need to be regulated. Tony Stark, Iron Man thinks it's necessary. While Steve Rogers, Captain America doesn't think so. That eventually splits their team, The Avengers. At a UN gathering where the regulations are being worked out, there's an explosion and some people are killed among them is the King of Wakanda. Investigation reveals that the bomb was planted by the Winter Soldier, who is Bucky Barnes, Captain America's friend during the war. Everyone is out to get Barnes and kill him if necessary but Steve wants to get to him first and help him. When he finds him he says he didn't plant the bomb, suddenly another person shows up who's out to get him dressed in black. When security forces catches up to them they are arrested and the one in black is revealed to be the son of the Wakandan King, T'Challa and he is the Black Panther the guardian of Wakanda. While in custody, a psychiatrist is sent to evaluate Bucky but suddenly the power goes out that's when he begins to say some words that have an effect on Bucky. He breaks out and Steve tries to get him. Believing that Bucky is innocent Steve sets out to find the man who got to him. Tony is told that because Steve helped Bucky he is now also wanted. He offers to bring him in so he asks War Machine ,and Black Widow to join him. He recruits someone to help him while Widow offers T'Challa to join them. Steve brings Falcon with him who gets Ant Man and Steve calls Hawkeye who gets Wanda whom tony has under lock and key under the eye of Vision. They get away and Vison joins tony. Eventually they all have a confrontation.</p>
<p>After another international incident involving the Avengers, world leaders and political powers move to get the Avengers to be registered in lieu of previous missions that have caused collateral damage. This results in the Avengers having to decide whether to remain free or to be registered. It also results in two factions with one led by Captain America, who believes that heroes should remain free and the other led by Iron Man, who surprisingly begins supporting government regulation and oversight. And all the while, Cap must try and protect his old friend Bucky from both Tony and the schemes of a new villain who emerges with a plan that could shock the world.</p>
<p>A possible cure for superheroes deeply divides courageous Captain America and arrogant Tony Stark. Factions of superheroes divides themselves in to Team Captain America and Team Stark. Black Widow and Hawekye must choose sides. Plus, Bucky Barnes is possibly behind the murder of King T'Chaka, a member of one of the factions, and T'Challa his son plans to kill him.</p>
<p>After another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps, one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.</p>
<p>Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was a movie that had an intriguing story, and since I own the Civil War comic, I was curious to see how this movie would play out. I had hoped it might right the wrongs made by Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Well guys, I was wrong.No bias, completely honest. Captain America: Civil War is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This entire film is nothing but rabbit trails, it is leading up to a film that never happens, Baron Zemo is one of the worst villains in a comic book movie to date (Next to Dr. Doom.) This movie is a complete cashgrab, the fight scenes look so fake, it has absolutely no emotional weight.The fight scenes have no stakes or consequences whatsoever. They are making quips every other second, and it's super cringeworthy. The Ant-Man stuff (No spoilers.) in the movie is so laughable, I could not take the fight serious whatsoever. The things in this movie that are supposed to make it feel epic, is total complete garbage. A lot of the characters come off whiny in this movie (Stark, Romanoff, Black Panther.). Black Panther, i will admit did have some cool moments, and he was one of my only positives of this. Movies are supposed to make you care, feel the heat of the battle, and feel the suspense of what's going on. I felt absolutely nothing for these characters, and the fact they kept deflating the movie with their stupid jokes made it even more difficult to feel the intensity of the battle.At least I felt it with Batman and Superman. That movie may have had a lot of problems, but I like it more because it was bold and I felt for Batman and Superman in the battle (Like the mother scene, it felt really emotional, but the movie kinda smothered the premise.) And every punch thrown in that movie, you felt it. Like the Warehouse scene, it felt real and I could feel the heat of the battle because every punch thrown could be felt. And with that movie, at least they had the balls to do bold things. This movie had no balls, let alone a spine.The main hero of the movie; Captain America, his reasons and logic to fight is completely stupid, and he was the most annoying character next to Stark.This is a Captain America movie, but I did not care for him. This was my issue with them doing Civil War with this movie, I knew they would not do that story justice, and it was a mistake from the beginning to include ALL the avengers. And regardless of whether you agree with me now, you probably will agree with this 2-3 years from now. Spider-Man, all I can say is, this guy will not shut up. I hated his suit and found him totally annoying (I liked Andrew Garfield more than Tom Holland.). Yes, I realize that's what he's like from the comics, but he comes off so over the top in this movie. At least Andrew Garfield balanced it to a point where he's not annoying, the movie just didn't do him justice (Both TASM and this.)Do not believe in the hype of this movie at all, cause you are being deceived (Like that moron Chris Stuckmann giving this movie an A+? What the heck is he smoking thinking that?) Don't buy into the lie about seeing it just because it's fun and entertaining. Cause your setting yourself up for disappointment.I'm going to give this movie a 3/10. I'm sorry Marvel fans, I just did not like it. As a matter of fact, I hated it. If you love or enjoy this movie, that's fine and I'm glad you guys enjoy it. But you have to acknowledge sooner or later that Marvel has no spine, and this fun and light tone is extremely cringeworthy and them smothering powerful stories is just wrong (Civil War was a total game changer in the comics, people died, consequences happened, this was no where near that.)</p>
