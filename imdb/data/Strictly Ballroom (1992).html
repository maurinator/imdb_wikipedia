<h1>Strictly Ballroom (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Scott Hastings is a champion caliber ballroom dancer, but much to the chagrin of the Australian ballroom dance community, Scott believes in dancing "his own steps". Fran is a beginning dancer and a bit of an ugly duckly who has the audacity to ask to be Scott's partner after his unorthodox style causes his regular partner to dance out of his life. Together, these two misfits try to win the Australian Pan Pacific Championships and show the Ballroom Confederation that they are wrong when they say, "there are no new steps!"</p>
<p>A maverick dancer risks his career by performing an unusual routine and sets out to succeed with a new partner.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was nothing like I expected at first.  It's got the frenetic sense of humour that most Australian films of the period exuded, for one thing.  And it's not a simple boy-meets-girl-and-they-dance story...that's the heart of it, but there's a lot of weirdness along the way.  Basically, it's in-fighting backstage at Come Dancing.  It begins Baz Luhrmann's ascent to greatness.  And it features a truly odd performance from Barry Otto as Scott's father.</p>
