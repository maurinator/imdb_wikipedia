<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a really good film! Yes, it is a bit banal at times, but the general impression that I got, is that it stands the test of time. It has been fabulously restored for DVD in 2011. One of the really nice things about the film, is that Greenlandic people actually speak Greenlandic (and the Danes speak Danish). The DVD has got subtitles. It is a rare film since very few films has actually been made in Greenland, and it gives a fine view into the beliefs of people at the time of filming (1956). It also gives a good impression on how people lived in a small Greenlandic village at the time. Well acted by all. I will gladly recommend it for all.</p>
