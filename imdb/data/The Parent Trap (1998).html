<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Parent Trap " is good but its star Lindsay Lohan is better as she was able to steal my breath away in dual roles playing Hallie and Annie Parker. Working with such a clever plot, Lohan has almost single handily pulled off one of the best performances of 1998.Also, what a breath a fresh air to Hollywood as she explodes on the scene as one of the best child actresses I've seen in a long time. The proof is a movie called "The Parent Trap."Lohan's performance is great but we also must not forget that it stars Dennis Quaid as one of the best actors I've seen. With his versatile talent in film genres such as drama, action, or family, Quaid has the ability to capture my attention for the length of the movie."The Parent Trap" is a light hearted film that will allow the mind to flow freely while sitting and relaxing. In addition, the movie was not only clever, but original because Lohan pulled off her role as she knew what she was doing without having to be told what to do. Lohan is a natural talent that should be treasured because she is so good and seen in more filmsThe supporting cast also fit, which made it that much more enjoyable to watch. Good cast choices all the way around. I suggest that everyone see this film because it is really good clean fun with one of the brightest and youngest stars to hit Hollywood. Bravo to the cast and crew of "The Parent Trap."</p>
