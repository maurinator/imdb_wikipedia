<p>A developmentally disabled young man tries to continue the work his father did in communicating with extra-terrestrials from outer space, which leads to something miraculous and wonderful.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay so Koi Mil Gaya came out during a time when Hrithik Roshan's career was in a nosedive. After its success, everyone talked about how Rakesh Roshan saved Hrithik's career.Then I watched this movie and all I have to say is that Roshan Sr. should be the one thanking Hrithik. I will, however, give Rakesh Roshan credit for bringing a novel idea to Indian audiences. Science fiction stories are not common in Bollywood, and the director has helped in moving the film industry in a new direction.Apart from this, the only other asset of Koi Mil Gaya is Hrithik Roshan. He brilliantly plays the part of a mentally disabled man who is a child on the inside. He is able to add layers to the character despite gross oversimplification by the writers. However, as Rohit is slowly cured by Jadoo, Hrithik's performance slides into mediocrity alongside the rest of the movie, mainly because the character ceases to be interesting.Apart from this the movie has nothing else to offer. The rest of the cast overacts and the story itself is boring and predictable. Its sad when a director can't make a movie about an alien, interesting.Rakesh Roshan has always been a below average director. Adding a science fiction angle with new special effects (for India) will not make him better. A talented son doesn't make the dad a better director either. We all know that Hrithik is a star but he also has a lot of potential to be an 'actor'. I hope he begins picking better projects both inside and outside his own production house.</p>
