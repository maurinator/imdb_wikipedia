<h1>Dangerously Close (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rebel without a cause or a clue at an elite but uptight High School discovers some of his classmates have formed an even more elite clique more or less hell-bent on ridding the school, and quite possibly American society, of what they deem to be its undesirables because of ethnicity, politics, etc. Our hero recruits a teacher and some other "less desirable" classmates to undermine the elitists, and, naturally, things get quite violent.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Reading the synopsis to this film, I was reminded of movies like Skulls and Disturbing Behavior, where a small, tightly protected group of richies form an underground society to target unwanted classmates.This movie, written in part by actor John Stockwell who portrays the unofficial leader of the Sentinels, Verde High's fascist secret society formed to "serve and protect", is nearly identical to a made-for-tv movie released the same year called Brotherhood of Justice. Brotherhood was based on a true story of a secret society formed at a Texas high school that eventually went from theft and vandalism prevention to goals of extreme violence. So, I wonder if the writers of Dangerously Close were inspired by the same events. The major differences between the two, however, are that Brotherhood of Justice is primarily told from the viewpoint of one of the leaders of the gang, while Dangerously Close is seen from the viewpoint of one of their prospective victims. And, secondly, in Dangerously Close, the high school principal, sponsor of the gang, was the pivotal force behind the murders. The Sentinels were only supposed to rough up a few of their targets. The Texas High School events which Brotherhood is based on, left out the involvement that the gym coach had in the secret society. That is why I think both films were inspired by the same events. It was alright. I've always enjoyed John Stockwell, or at least his earlier appearances and behind-the-camera work. It was also nice seeing Robert Russler, though only briefly. I thought it was a pretty good B-rated thriller.</p>
