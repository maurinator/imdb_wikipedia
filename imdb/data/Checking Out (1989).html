<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I reckon this is a great movie! Jeff Daniels is so good in it! I think the jokes are funny! him being a Hypocondriact is funny... but also as you watch you can see how hurt he is inside and you feel sorry for him. Jeff looks quite cute in this. It's got a bit of Monty python style humour in it. which is very good and enjoyable. Awesome soundtrack! containing The Traveling Wilburys and Roy Orbison, etc. and was even made by George Harrison's company "Handmade films" This movie makes you appreciate the fact that you have good health. and that you shouldn't spend your life worrying about things, when you could be living you life to the fullest. A great movie indeed! :)</p>
