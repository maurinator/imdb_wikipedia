<h1>But I'm a Cheerleader (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Megan is an all-American girl. She's a cheerleader and has a boyfriend, but she doesn't like kissing him very much, and she's pretty tactile with her cheerleader friends, and she only has pictures of girls up in her locker. Her parents and friends conclude that she *must* be gay and send her off to "sexual redirection" school, full of admittedly homosexual misfits, where she can learn how to be straight. Will Megan be turned around to successful heterosexuality, or will she succumb to her love for the beautiful Graham?</p>
<p>Megan is a normal American girl who's one of the best cheerleaders on the team, along with having the captain of the football team as the perfect boyfriend, but there are some very unnormal things about her, including the fact that she doesn't like kissing her boyfriend, has posters of girls in her locker and at home, and likes listening to Melissa Ethridge. Does this mean that the normal Megan may, in fact, be... a lesbian?!?! Concerned parents and friends send her to True Directions, a gay-gone-straight camp led by the well-meaning yet totally insane Mary and the "ex-gay" counselor Mike. As time passes before graduation, Megan starts to come to terms with the fact that she's a lesbian and that she's in love with Graham, who stays totally open with her sexuality, even though her parents are ready to kill her if she comes home a lesbian.</p>
<p>A naive teenager is sent to rehab camp when her straitlaced parents and friends suspect her of being a lesbian.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For anyone who grew up or is growing up gay in middle-America or just about all of America, get ready to return to the most twisted version of your high school years and laugh till you're pink in the face.  But, I'm a Cheerleader is one of the best gay themed movies to date.  It is certainly one of the best comedies.  Sort of a Jeffrey turned female high school cheerleader meets John Waters with only the best qualities of each. I only wish this film had been available when I was a high school senior nearly fifteen years ago.  It could have saved me thousands of dollars a year in therapy!  If you are gay, and especially young or dealing with coming out at any age either to yourself and/or to others please go rent this movie.  This is one of the only films I've seen which shows you can have a wonderful life and be happy and be loved and be gay.</p>
