<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Almost a hidden gem, except that no one has an excuse for not knowing about any Woody film.  The cast is delightful.  Every line of dialog is laced with wit and humor.  No New York angst here, just the usual relationship muddle, mixed with the usual existential questions of the the meaning of love and life and ...Not a message movie.  As the title indicates, the point of all this is comedy.  My favorite bit, which didn't make it into the quotes section goes something like this:<Andrew is hovering outside Maxwell's window in his self-propelled helicopter>Maxwell: Andrew!  What do you think you're doing?Andrew: Its an invention of mine.  I think I've got most of the bugs worked out.  What do you think?Maxwell:  Andrew, don't be silly.  You can't fly.Andrew:  I can't?Maxwell: Of course not!  You're a mammal!Andrew: Oh.<Andrew crashes to ground>Tony Roberts is the perfect straight man.  Its a pity that Woody hasn't used him in some of his later films. This is one of those handful of films that can be watched over and over again.  One to own.  Sadly, this (and several other Woody masterpieces) are out of print.</p>
