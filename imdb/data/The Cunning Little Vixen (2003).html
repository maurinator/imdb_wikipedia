<h1>The Cunning Little Vixen (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An adaptation of Leos Janacek's opera Prihody Lisky Bystrousky (1925), based on the novel Liska Bystrouska by Rudolf Tesnohlidek. It follows the life of Sharp-Ears, a fox who is captured by a forester as a cub and raised in his home prior to escaping back into the forest.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Cunning Little Vixen is perhaps my favourite Janacek opera, though I am very fond of Jenufa as well. I knew I had to see this animated featurette, and I wasn't disappointed. For a live production of the opera, I recommend the wonderful 1995 performance with Thomas Allen as the Forrester. A quarter of the opera is cut here, but considering it's a featurette and an animated one at that that wasn't a problem. The basic story feel, enchanting and moving, is there still. The music is still gorgeous, helped by the beautiful orchestral playing and Kent Nagano's sensitive and suitably spacious reading. Christine Buffle has a lovely and youthful-sounding voice and is endearing in the title role, while Grant Doyle sings with such warmth and richness as the Forrester. All the characters have colourful personalities, which immediately makes them identifiable to anybody whatever age they are. The visuals are another outstanding asset, the backgrounds especially are really luscious and do have that enchanting look in the colours. Overall, a really fantastic animated Cunning Little Vixen. 10/10 Bethany Cox</p>
