Rodney and others travel to Earth to look into Jeannie's disappearance but Rodney is soon kidnapped and put to work as well. Rodney and Jeannie think they have found a working solution but when it fails, there is only one solution left to them - they need expert help and the only expert who knows more they do is Todd the Wraith.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is another episode where we get to see David Hewlett's real sister back in the role as his in-show sister.I understand David Hewlett as Rodney McKay is some people's least favorite character in this show, but I don't understand why. He is an excellent actor, and in this episode he is truly sparkling with his brilliant performance. He was the main reason I watched Stargate Atlantis until the end, and still keep watching it over and over.The episode is also a crossover to Stargate SG-1, although the latter was canceled at the time, but I love cross-overs none the less. There is a pretty witty dialogue between Ronon and Sgt. Walter.I also like sci-fi shows where they bring things to the 'real world', and there is a fair share of that in this episode.8 thumbs up from me!</p>
