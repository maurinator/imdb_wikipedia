<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Pinocchio is a very well crafted story about just how much the media effects people, as seen through the eyes of our main protagonist, Dal-Po. There is also a very nice romance in there.The main thing I enjoyed about Pinocchio was how well it was able to balance drama and comedy. The main story was where the drama came from, and was kept in the arc of the main characters. The main characters did have some comedic moments, but most of the comedy was kept to the side characters, which I liked. This was one of those rare shows where you really got to know and like the side characters. I also enjoyed how unique the story was. There aren't too many shows about what goes in the world of journalism. If I must nitpick, I have to say that I wish they would've cut out some of those clich√© moments. Yes I know that Korean Dramas are well known for being soap opera-like, and that those moments very rarely occur in this drama. However, it really took out of the realism of it all when there is a long and silent stare while a ballad plays in the background.This was the first Korean Drama I ever watched, and I'm glad of it. If you are trying to get into Korean Drama, this is a good place to start.</p>
