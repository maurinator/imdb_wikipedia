<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This started out as a great movie, but is a classic, classic case of an end-game botch job:  The filmmakers simply could not figure out how to end this movie!  It's *really* way, way too bad, because all the hard work setting things up deserved follow-through.  I've never seen such a bold quality-related contrast in a movie.I could almost recommend it in spite of this failure, simply because of the writing and character development.  It's a fun movie in a number of ways.I guess in the end I'll have to suggest you pass this one up.</p>
