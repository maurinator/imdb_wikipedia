<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>36 Ghante is a movie that will remain etched in my memory as one of the few convincing movies that I have seen. Convincing in the sense that almost each and every situation and dialogue is presented in the most natural way, the way a viewer expects it to be in a similar real life situation. Its greatness is not dependent upon the plot of the movie, rather on the treatment it receives. For example, when dead tired of the tyranny of the hostage-takers, the editor's son boasts childishly that he will shoot them with his toy pistol, the father warns, "the guns in the criminal's hands are real ones." Even the minute details are treated with dainty sumptuousness, such as the sequence related to the kidnapping of the Coca Cola delivery truck. It also shows a glimpse of the 70s' well-off families' everyday life. Rajkumar gives a most striking performance as the wise, cool-minded head of a family.</p>
