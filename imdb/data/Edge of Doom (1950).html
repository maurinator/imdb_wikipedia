<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>St. Stephen's is a poor Catholic parish, the neighborhood in which it is located the home of many down-and-outers, who are just trying to survive. One of the more devout of the parishioners was Mrs. Martin Lynn, who just passed away. Her son, Martin Lynn Jr., is a hard working, conscientious young man, who feels the church has done his family no good. Unable to pay for a lavish funeral for his mother which he feels he owes her, unable to convince the church to do so on his behalf, and unforgiving of the fact that the church would not sanction even a burial for his father who committed suicide years ago, Martin, in a fit of violence, kills the seemingly unsympathetic senior parish priest, Father Kirkman, who admitted that he lost touch with his parishioners in his later years. Following the killing, Martin, not wanting to implicate his loving girlfriend Julie in the crime, tries desperately to find anyone else to help him arrange the lavish funeral. As he is denied at every turn, he begins to alienate those around him. The only person who can at least assist and who Martin hasn't alienated is the parish's junior priest, Father Roth. When Father Roth discovers through other means that Martin killed Father Kirkman, Father Roth prays that Martin will do what's best for his immortal soul.</p>
<p>A mentally unbalanced young man kills a priest. One of the priest's colleagues sets out to find the killer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Farley Granger is a young man on the "Edge of Doom," in this 1950 film also starring Dana Andrews, Mala Powers and Paul Stewart. When a young priest wants to change parishes, Father Roth (Dana Andrews) tells the story of Martin Lynn (Granger), saying that what happened with Martin showed him that, as a priest, he was in the right place. Martin Lynn is a young man who is having trouble making ends meet as a delivery man for a florist; he has a chronically ill mother, and he wants to be able to move her to Arizona. However, after working with the florist for four years, he still can't get a raise. When his mother dies, he wants a high-priced funeral for her. He goes to the church rectory, as his mother was deeply religious and, despite living in near poverty, always gave what she could to the parish church. In an ensuing argument with an old, tired and tough priest (Harold Vermilyea), Martin hits him over the head, and the priest dies. Later, he's picked up, not for the murder, but for the robbery of a movie theater actually done by his neighbor (Paul Stewart). Though released, the detective in charge (Robert Keith) is still suspicious of him."Edge of Doom" is a grim noir that never lets up; Martin Lynn can't get a break, not from his boss, the funeral director or the church. His girlfriend (Mala Powers) at first feels there is no place for her in his life because of his mother. After the mother dies and Paul commits murder, he breaks up with her. His only support is Father Roth, whom he doesn't like - he resents the church for not burying his father on hallowed ground when he committed suicide and for taking his mother's money. It's not often in a film that one sees a priest killed - and with a cross yet.The acting is good if not great. Farley Granger is sympathetic as Martin. He was often cast in this type of role. Dana Andrews does an okay job as the priest, but is a little too precious. The way to play a priest is the way Spencer Tracy did - as a man first. Andrews tries to put on a priestly air but it seems forced.Apparently this film was not well received upon release and was withdrawn to add the very beginning, where Andrews begins to tell the story, and the very end, which comes back to the present time with Andrews and the priest. It doesn't really help the film's relentless, depressing tone. Don't watch this one if you need a smile or a feel-good movie.</p>
