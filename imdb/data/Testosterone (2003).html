<h1>Testosterone (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dean has been stumped for some time in his attempt to produce a follow-up to "I was a Teenage Speed Freak," his incredibly successful graphic novel. His fans expect great things from him and his editor, Louise, is hounding him. Instead of working, however, Dean spends his time searching for his Argentine lover Pablo, who went out one night for cigarettes and never came back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A smart, funny, thriller. It's a new and interesting direction for gay films, and one that I enjoyed because it refuses to follow the usual stereotypes for gay men. I saw it in a packed theater in San Francisco, where the audience seemed to totally enjoy the ride. Director David Moreton daringly lets the film turn dark -- he's not afraid to show an obsessive gay man acting as freaked out as an obsessive straight man. He allows his characters to be human and flawed. This is also a great crossover film for straight audiences. I went with three friends (including a straight couple) and they all liked it too. Antonia Sabato, Jr. has a surprisingly funny character, Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious as usual, and Celina Font is terrific as the Argentine woman who wins in the end. I think women will love this movie.</p>
