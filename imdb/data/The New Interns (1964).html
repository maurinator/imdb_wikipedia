<h1>The New Interns (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Playboy Alec Considine returns to New North Hospital for another year's internship after suffering a mental breakdown during his first attempt at internship. Among the new interns he guides around the hospital are the explosive Tony Parelli, a former slum boy who is soon at odds with Dr. Riccio, head of the hospital; and Phil Osterman, who smuggles his bride into the intern's quarters to live. Parelli falls in love with Nancy Terman, a social worker who goes to pieces when she is raped by delinquents whom Parelli knew from the slums. Newly married resident Dr. Lew Worship learns that he is sterile, and the news nearly wrecks his marriage, but he and his wife, Gloria, solve their problem by deciding to adopt children. Nancy's assailants are brought into the hospital following a gang fight, and they confront Parelli. After a fight in which Considine is wounded, Parelli conquers his hatred enough to make a sincere attempt to save his enemy's life. Meanwhile, Dr. Osterman's pregnant wife is discovered in the men's quarters by Mrs. Hitchcock, the house-mother, but she promises to remain silent so that the couple can live together until he completes his year of duty.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've never considered "The New Interns" a great triumph of creativity, but it's a good movie with soap opera-type story and fine acting by many future stars.The movie is an in-name-only sequel to "The Interns" (1962) and follows the experiences of several interns at a big city hospital as they learn medicine. Like many hospital films, there are several subplots going on at once: doctor Dean Jones and nurse Stephanie Powers want to have a baby but can't; doctor Telly Savalas is Chief of Surgery and is always yelling; intern Michael Callan just wants to chase female nurses; intern Segal and social worker Stevens fall in love; intern Segal is ultra-dedicated to medicine and intern Callan just wants to party; intern Furth's wife is living in the (gasp!) men's dorm; patient Adam Williams is dying and he's mad about it; and so on. It gets a little hard to follow at times, I admit.The film's best part is a drunken party, and Sue Ane Langdon is great as a druggy prostitute faking paralysis so she can get into the hospital and get "some real stuff". The battles between Segal and Savalas are entertaining, leading up to a rather limp moralistic conclusion.My fondness for this movie is probably due to my love of mid-1960s cinema; also it's the only movie I know of in which Dean Jones gets drunk and cheats on his wife. It's also obvious that the filmmakers had another sequel in mind, since all sorts of loose ends were left dangling at the end. Very good for its type.PS: Isn't that Bob Crane at the party?</p>
