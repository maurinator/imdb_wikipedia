<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an excellent family film and I disagree with the previous reviewer. I think Fred MacMurray was an expert at playing the father on television and I don't think this movie is any exception. He was just perfect for the part and really fathers can be any age. This is also a movie with a good message about making the best of your relationships while you have the chance, giving quality time and not just "providing" for your family. The father in the movie is very absorbed with providing for his family, but has forgotten what is most important. His children & wife are growing away from him and he doesn't even know it. It takes an angel to help him "wake up" and to give him that 2nd chance to start over. Excellent and I hope it is released on DVD soon.</p>
