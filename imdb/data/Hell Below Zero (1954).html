<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hell Below Zero is one of three British movies Alan Ladd (Shane) appeared in. The Black Night was one of the others. I enjoyed this.A man signs on a whaling ship and one of the reasons for this is to help a woman find her Dad's killer. The expedition takes them to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic, where they track the killer down on a rival whaling ship. Not surprisingly, Ladd also falls in love with the woman.There is some good photography in this movie, which is shot well in colour. I first thought is was black and white when I purchased it.The rest of the cast includes Joan Tetzel as the love interest, Stanley Baker (Zulu) as the murderer and Basil Sydney.Hell Below Zero is a good way to spend 90 minutes one afternoon or evening. Very good.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</p>
