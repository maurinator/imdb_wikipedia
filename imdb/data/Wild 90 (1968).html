<h1>Wild 90 (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Norman Mailer's first feature filmmaking effort stars the director and his two longtime collaborators Buzz Farbar and Mickey Knox as a trio of gangsters holed up in a ramshackle New York apartment, drinking, braying, and fighting.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had wanted to see "Wild 90" for many years after reading about it in a book about bad movies, which gave some samples of some dopey dialogue found in the movie. Now that it's available on home video after being withdrawn for many years, was it worth the wait? For the most part, no. Most of the movie comes across as very amateurish, from the poorly recorded audio to the inept work by the cameraman - amateur work that is simply bad, not so bad that it's funny. Also, with the movie obviously being largely improved and not scripted, there is simply no story or evolution of characters - the movie just drones on and on without progressing in the least. What saves the movie from being completely unwatchable are the parts when Norman Mailer is up front and center. His acting and improved dialogue are so unbelievably bad that they do provide a good deal of unintended laughs. But sadly not enough to make the movie worth seeking out.</p>
