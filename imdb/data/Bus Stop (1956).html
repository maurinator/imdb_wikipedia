<h1>Bus Stop (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Innocent rodeo cowboy Bo falls in love with cafe singer Cherie in Phoenix. She tries to run away to Los Angeles but he finds her and forces her to board the bus to his home in Montana. When the bus stops at Grace's Diner the passengers learn that the road ahead is blocked. By now everyone knows of the kidnapping, but Bo is determined to have Cherie.</p>
<p>Twenty-one year old Beauregard Decker, who owns his own ranch in Timber Hill, Montana, and his friend, Virgil Blessing, who is like a father to him, are heading to Phoenix, Arizona by bus for Beau to take part in the Phoenix World Rodeo Championship. As Beau has had no experience with women being isolated on the ranch, this trip only being the second time in his life that he has stepped foot off the ranch, Virgil believes this trip may be a good time for Beau to start thinking about women with the eventual goal of finding a wife. Virgil's idea of such a wife for Beau is a girl like Elma Duckworth, a young next-door type who boards the bus at Grace's Diner in southern Utah. But Beau, who wants to marry an "angel" and will know that angel when he sees her, immediately believes that that woman is Chérie, the performer at the Blue Dragon Café in Phoenix, she who also hustles for drinks from the customers on her boss' directive. Chérie, from River Gulch, Arkansas, decided to hit the road with no goal or destination in mind, and along the way figured her destiny was to be a Hollywood star. Beyond her beauty, Chérie is talentless and uneducated, even to the ways of the world, even though her outward appearance makes her look experienced. She has often been taken advantage of. Socially unaware and direct Beau, who figures he has no time to court, does whatever he needs to to get Chérie to go with him back to Montana as his wife after the rodeo has concluded, wanting to look experienced with women in the process. He ends up being single-minded in his pursuit of her. Despite being physically attracted to him, Chérie may have other things on her mind than marriage to a bully of a Montana cowboy.</p>
<p>A naive but stubborn cowboy falls in love with a saloon singer and tries to take her away against her will to get married and live on his ranch in Montana.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marilyn Monroe is so good here it's startling. Her Cherie (with the accent on the first syllable, remember) is one of the most lovable characters in the history of film. That the rest of the movie is rocky-going and her co-star is no match for her is unfortunate, but not fatal.Apparently the director, Joshua Logan, was able to create a relatively peaceful environment where Monroe could completely "let go" and allow her natural fragility and sex appeal to take over. When she's on screen it's impossible to take your eyes off her, not just because she's beautiful (what starlet from the 1950's WASN'T beautiful?) but because she's laying bare her character's soul for the camera (and in the process much of her own soul as well). She isn't just reading lines with various inflections or doing bits of business like so many actors do, she's bringing the character to life. Unforgettable is the moment where she finds herself perched on the shoulder of the crazy, lovestruck cowboy watching a parade and she's trying to pantomime to a friend in the crowd how she wound up up there. Or the way she keeps "shushing" the loud-talking bus driver so that he won't wake up the sleeping cowboy as she's planning her escape. Or the way she can't make eye contact or get her lazy backwoods accent (that is incredibly charming) to sound firm enough when she keeps trying to tell the cowboy to get lost. Her comic timing is just sublime and unteachable. Don Murray's performance as the cowboy, criminally and inexplicably Oscar-nominated, is cloying, two-dimensional and geared for the stage, not the intimacy of film. He needs to provide some hint of vulnerabilty before he's humbled in the fist fight with the bus driver, but he is tragically not up to the task. His Beauregard is the kind of loud-mouthed, uncouth buffoon that only a greatly skilled comic actor can make sympathetic, and Murray simply doesn't know how to finesse the comic moments and make them work. Monroe receives fine support from Arthur O'Connell as Beau's older, wiser friend Virgil Blessing, but this is her show all the way. She makes it a good movie, but one can't help imagining how much better it could have been had it been directed by someone like Kazan and co-starred possibly Rock Hudson.</p>
