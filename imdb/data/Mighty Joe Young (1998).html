<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mighty Joe Young is terrific family fare, and one of the better movies of 1998.  It is based on the immortal classic from 1947 of the same name about a young woman and her faithful 20-foot tall, 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.Great special effects featuring Joe are the real highlight of the film, especially the animatronics and CGI which truly bring Joe to life.There are also good performances, especially from Charlize Theron as the young woman, Jill, and Bill Paxton, fresh from Titanic, as the scientist who loves her.But, the real star is the title character, the Mighty Joe, who brings a wonderfully gentle screen presence, and is the true hero of the film.Highly recommended for children of all ages.</p>
