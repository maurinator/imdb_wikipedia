<p>An emotive journey of a former school teacher, who writes letters for illiterate people at Rio de Janeiro's central station, Central do Brasil; and a young boy, whose mother has just died in a car accident, to Brazil's remote Northeast, in search for the father he never knew.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Great movie, warm and bittersweet.  It somehow reminded me ofMy Life as a Dog (1985) because it more or less deals with thesame issues, but we move from the Swedish North to the sunnyBrazilian South.  Beautiful colors, great acting--Josue and Doramake a wonderful pair and they really foil each other out.  Almoststarts dragging a little before the end, but it picks up again.  I highlyrecommend.</p>
