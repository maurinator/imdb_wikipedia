<h1>Universe (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Beginning with a dramatization of the nightly work of an astronomer at the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario, the documentary film shifts to focus on the workings of the universe. A journey to the stars is depicted in animation and takes the viewer to the boundaries of the heavenly bodies: the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Pluto, to the farthest regions of space beyond the reach of the strongest telescope, past the Sun and the Milky Way into unfathomed galaxies.</p>
<p>A journey through the universe as it would appear to a space traveler beginning at the David Dunlap Observatory on Earth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short, done under the auspices of the National Film Board of Canada, holds up quite well in an area that can date in an instant.  The animation effects are exceptional and my only real problem was with the narrator who came perilously close to becoming a cure for insomnia.  Very well done, it was nominated for an Oscar for Documentary Short.  Recommended, with the caveat that later information renders some of this less useful on technical points.</p>
