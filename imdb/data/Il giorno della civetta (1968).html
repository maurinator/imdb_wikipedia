<h1>Il giorno della civetta (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rosa Nicolosi is not the widow of Salvatore Colasberna, the man murdered in the beginning of the movie, but she is in fact the wife of Paolo Nicolosi, the only eyewitness of the murder. Paolo goes missing the same morning as the murder occurs.</p>
<p>Based on the Leonardo Sciascia novel of the same title, this story deals with the difficulties facing a northern police officer investigating a Mafia murder in a small Sicilian town in 1961. Salvatore Colasbena, a construction supplier, was murdered # and buried under a blanket of tar # because he refused to join the Mafia-controlled roadbuilding group. His widow, Rosa, is investigated by the police, but honest Captain Bellodi comes to suspect Mafia boss Don Mariano Arena when he can find no witnesses, no evidence, only hostile obstruction by corrupt government influences. Captain Bellodi has no idea that his pursuit of the truth will stir up a hornet's nest. Powerful figures have a vested interest in ensuring that the very existence of the Mafia can be denied. The movie dramatizes the hold that the Mafia has on Sicilian life: the police, the judiciary, politics, and the Catholic Church. Everyone in the village is afraid to talk to Bellodi for fear they will be silenced forever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first great thriller by director Damiano Damiani, followed by many remarkable films in the 70s, such as "Io ho paura" with Gian Maria Volonte and "Un uomo in ginocchio" with Giuliano Gemma. "Il giorno della civetta" has a marvelous cast: Franco Nero just risen to stardom with "Django" (1966), Claudia Cardinale can be seen here a year before "Once Upon a Time in the West", and veteran tough guy Lee J Cobb. Sciascia's story about the murdered boss of a building company fits Damiano's way to illustrate his view on society: too many people are looking for the easy way out and keep their mouths shut. Simple, direct, honest - few films have so much credibility. Still, for an understandable commercial reason, Mrs Cardinale's role became bigger than it was in the novel.</p>
