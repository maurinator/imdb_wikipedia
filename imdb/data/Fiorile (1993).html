<h1>Fiorile (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While travelling to visit their grandfather, two children are told the story of a family curse that has lasted two hundred years. During Napoleon's Italian invasion, Elisabetta Benedetti fell in love with French soldier Jean - but while Jean was distracted, Elisabetta's brother Corrado stole some gold that Jean was guarding, and set the curse in train. The Benedettis become wealthy, corrupt and hated by their former friends, who rename them the Maledettis - the cursed. The childrens' grandfather Massimo is the last man to be directly affected by the curse - but will he pass it onto them?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like all the Taviani Brothers films, this one looks great, but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism, and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a "story". In actuality, this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film.</p>
