<h1>The Wrong Man (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>US merchant sailor Alex Walker (Kevin Anderson) is stranded in Mexico, penniless and wanted by the police. He meets and joins up with an unlikely couple - aging but likable shit Phillip Mills (John Lithgow) and young sexy, frustated wife Missy (Rosanna Arquette). The three develop a curiously inter-dependent relationship. Meanwhile, Police Captain Diaz and Detective Ortega are closing in and the plot circle is closed at Tapachula rail station amidst a stack of mistakes and wrong decisions.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kevin Anderson is the wrong man in "The Wrong Man". The story has nothing to do with the Hitchcock movie, but coincidentally Anderson is just as laid back as Henry Fonda, the star of that one. The skeleton plot is simple and neo-noir. Anderson, in Mexico where he has fled from a trial for second-degree murder (it was actually self-defense), is in the wrong place at the wrong time where a smuggler has been shot and killed. John Lithgow and Rosanna Arquette help him escape. Two Mexican policemen are the main ones after him, a younger inexperienced one and an older and wiser one. They add some comic relief.The chase is on but it really becomes a road movie of sorts in which character development comes first, and mainly those of the married pair Lithgow and Arquette who are both unusual characters. Both these actors have very juicy and extensive parts here, and they both deliver. Their roles are ambiguous enough for much of the film that you will be kept off balance by them. In addition, we get the feel of Mexico nicely as they move along from one place to another, and the music score complements this.This kind of movie requires patience. It does slow down and lose momentum, and it does make you wonder what the movie is about. The answer is that's it's about loneliness, personal attachments and their collisions with individual personality needs. It's about dreams people have. It's about love and letting go. It's about a woman's sexuality and what it does to men. It's about the complexity of the female of the species.This is quite a good movie.</p>
