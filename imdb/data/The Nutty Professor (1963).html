<h1>The Nutty Professor (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Nerd. Milquetoast. Klutz. These are just three of the many undesirable words that can be used to describe Professor Julius Kelp. But all that changes when the chemistry expert invents a potion that transforms him into a suave, sexy chick magnet, whom Julius aptly names Buddy Love. Unfortunately, there's one side effect: Buddy can't control when he'll change back into Julius, an event that always happens at inopportune times. How will Julius/Buddy resolve his Jekyll-and-Hyde dilemma?</p>
<p>Julius Kelp is a nerdy and not very handsome chemistry professor at small college. The mild mannered Kelp has been bullied all of his life and is now pushed around by his students, especially the football players. One of his students, the pretty Stella Purdy, encourages him to stand up to them but his approach is to develop a chemical solution that will turn him into a different man. What he develops turns him into Buddy Love, who Stella aptly describes as a rude and discourteous egomaniac. One thing he can't control however is when he turns back into Kelp, something that puts his secret in danger of becoming public.</p>
<p>Julius Kelp is an ugly chemistry teacher with no personal life. One day he creates something incredible! An elixir that transforms him into a totally different man, Buddy Love. He is very successful with women, and one of his students (Stella Purdy) falls in love with him. Of course nobody knows that this charming, cool guy is in fact Julius Kelp. Everyone is very excited with Buddy, but there is a problem. The elixir's effect doesn't last very long...</p>
<p>To improve his social life, a nerdish professor drinks a potion that temporarily turns him into the handsome, but obnoxious, Buddy Love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Further to my earlier review, I would wholeheartedly endorse the opinion of other reviewers that the original Lewis movie is superior - vastly superior to the crass Eddie Murphy re-make. Lewis's subtle points about Buddy Love(whom, I am unsurprised to learn, he loathed) are utterly lost in the Murphy version. If Lewis's movie fails as popular entertainment, it is because it makes extraordinary intellectual demands on its audience, requiring them to see beyond the surface glamour of Buddy Love to the moral rottenness and egotism within. Strangely enough, however, Buddy Love is not without pathos. There is enough of Kelp in him, together with the shakiness of his chemically-induced persona, to lend a faint suggestion of vulnerability. Perhaps even this is part of his satanic charm (he literally charms the pants off the college Principal). It is no coincidence that his calling-card number is "That Old Black Magic"!</p>
