<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>LOVE this short film!!I can't begin to say how great it is. It's so short, so simple, so quick witted and funny. Best short film I've seen by far. I love the acting, I love the camera. The ending is so clever you won't believe. You'll laugh your pants off.Not only is this a fantastic short film but it's available to watch free on YouTube so it's that much better. The overall aesthetics of the film is phenomenal: the colors, the cars, the costume, props. It's such a well rounded movie.All in all, a nicely compacted piece of cinema. If I had to describe this film in 3 words:Seamless, clever, satisfying!A DEFINITE recommendation to all you short film lovers.</p>
