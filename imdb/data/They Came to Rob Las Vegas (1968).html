<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an average to above-average heist film that is helped immeasurably by the lovely Elke Sommer's presence.  Once again, she wasn't able to do much with her character, beside being eye candy.  Gary Lockwood is staid, Lee J. Cobb gruff, and Jack Palance wired tight as we have come to expect.A 6 out of 10.  Best performance = Elke Sommer.  These late 60's crime pics were churned out ad nauseum, but the criminals' plan itself is fairly interesting.  Elke adds a measure of class with her beauty and poise that helps it plug along.  I remember seeing this at the drive-in on a double bill with THE WILD BUNCH.</p>
