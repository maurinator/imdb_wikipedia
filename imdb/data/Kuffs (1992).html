<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i just love this movie had not watch this in sometime, i had forgotten how good it was. i just laughed all the way though again slater is perfect in the roll of kuffs. it was a character tailor made for him. the endless banter to the camera is great and yes i no some people hatred it for that alone.each to there own.the cop story is your standard fare but its like ferris bullers day off with guns.it has good comedy good action and milla what more do you need i mean serious even the non widescreen DVD didn't distract me. and for me that is saying something. yes it is old school but you know thats its appeal it puts a smile on your dial for 90mins.</p>
