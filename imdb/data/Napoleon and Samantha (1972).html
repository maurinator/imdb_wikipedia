<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Determined boy runs away from his rural community rather than risk being placed in an orphanage, taking along his pet lion and little girlfriend for a journey through rugged terrain. Family film from Disney with nature-adventure asides never really gets going--mostly due to that sleepy lion, ambling through the picture as if drugged. The kids (talented Johnny Whitaker from "Family Affair" and wise-talking Jodie Foster in her first film role) are both good, even though they occasionally struggle with their delivery. Michael Douglas has fine, if colorless, supporting role as a well-meaning hippie-type who comes to their rescue. Younger children might enjoy it. ** from ****</p>
