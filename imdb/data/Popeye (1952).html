<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Popeye short takes a break from its usual villain Bluto and introduces a mouse who can't sleep because of Popeye's horrendous snoring. In this cartoon Popeye is almost the bad guy as he is in the wrong by preventing the little rodent from sleeping. As the mouse tries to put an end to this noise (that is getting really old), Popeye in return tries to stop the mouse from ever waking him up again. As a mouse trap backfires with the hilarious cleverness of the mouse, Popeye goes on a Tom and Jerry like chase around the house until he traps the little guy in an old spinach can. The story takes an ironic turn when the mouse uses Popeye's usual magic spinach to his own advantage and escapes making him victorious.</p>
