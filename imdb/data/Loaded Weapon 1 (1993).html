<h1>Loaded Weapon 1 (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An LA detective is murdered because she has microfilm with the recipe to make cocaine cookies. A "Lethal Weapon" style cop team tries to find and stop the fiends before they can dope the nation by distributing their wares via the "Wilderness Girls" cookie drive.</p>
<p>In this parody of buddy-cop comedies, General Curtis Mortars and Mr. Jigsaw are lacing Wilderness Girls cookies with cocaine. It's up to Sergeants Jack Colt and Wes Luger, as well as Billy York informant Becker, to put a stop to this.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another offering from National Lampoon, this time a mock-up of the classic Lethal Weapon series. Amusingly, they're not the only victims of parody here. Wayne's World, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Basic Instinct, Chips, Silence Of The Lambs and several others have been incorporated into this wildly hilarious (loosely used term) collage of moments. Obviously, not to be taken seriously and only recommended if you're not expecting a movie that offers a deep-dwelling plot. But it's totally for you if you're into a belly-laugh or two. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is laudable and so is co-star's Emilio Estevez. There are countless cameos by many Hollywood stars and all seem to make the movie a little more entertaining in their own typical way. Definitley worth a rent...</p>
