<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not really *LOL*  but I do like her opening song.  The rest kind've stink, and only Billy Barty is really good in it... but he's good in everything! Definately for children.  They'll love it!  If you have children, and you aren't sure whether the story is too scary for them or not, just sit with them in your arms and let them bury their face in your shoulder.  They'll never need you to sit with them again!</p>
