<h1>Atlantis, the Lost Continent (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Greek Fisherman brings an Atlantean Princess back to her homeland which is the mythical city of Atlantis. He is enslaved for his trouble. The King is being manipulated by an evil sorcerer who is bent on using a natural resource of Atlantis to take over the world. The Atlanteans, or rather the slaves of Atlantis, are forced to mine a crystalline material which absorbs the suns rays. These crystals can then be used for warmth. The misuse of science has created weapons out of the crystals that can fire a heat ray to destroy whatever it touches.</p>
<p>3,000 years ago, a Greek fisherman escorts a shipwrecked Atlantean princess to her home on an advanced eighth continent... beyond the "Pillars of Hercules."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Yes, yes. Actually, I encountered this movie first as a "comic book based on the movie" when I was 11 years old (in 1961). That comic book really made an impression on me! (Money well-spent from my paper route). Anyway, the part I like best is where the Atlanteans are making men into beasts by grafting snouts and horns onto them. Impressive!  I can't work out whether its "Island of Dr Moreau meets Ulysses" or "Pinochhio meets Jason and the Argonauts". However, all of that doesn't really matter.  Let's just say they don't make em like this no more. Stiff, Biblical-epic-style acting abounds.Three cheers for George Pal!</p>
