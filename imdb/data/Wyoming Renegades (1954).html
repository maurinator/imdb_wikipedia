<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brady Sutton {Phil Carey}, once a member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang, returns home to Broken Bow after serving three years in jail. Wanting a fresh start, he finds the town are unwilling to believe he has gone straight; only his girlfriend, Nancy Warren, and a stranger, Charlie Veer, are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. Things turn bad when Cassidy and mob turn up to rob the town bank and Brady is believed to have been part of a set up. Forced to go on the run with Charlie, can Brady clear his name? Or is he destined to forever be an outlaw as part of Cassidy's crew?Directed by Fred F. Sears {Earth vs. the Flying Saucers}, Wyoming Renegades has no stars of note, no real pedigree and a pretty mundane script. It is however enjoyable enough if one can get past the bad acting and the suspend disbelief ending. The story, although a familiar one of a bad guy trying to go good, is just about interesting enough to hold the viewer for the short running time of just under 75 minutes. Putting yet another spin on the Butch Cassidy {Gene Evans, great voice, bad actor} story, the film is at least offering up insight into a gang dynamic. And of course there's a little romantic angle {Martha Hyler solid enough and with nice hair} to keep things spicy in the last quarter. Decent enough location work comes from Iverson Ranch in California and Douglas Kennedy {The Last Wagon} as Veer earns his wages. 5/10</p>
