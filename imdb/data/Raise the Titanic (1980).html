<h1>Raise the Titanic (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of Americans are interested in raising the ill-fated Ocean liner Titanic. One of the team members finds out the Russians also have plans to raise the ship from its watery grave. Why all the interest ? A rare mineral on board could be used to power a sound beam that will knock any missile out of the air when entering us airspace.</p>
<p>The American military have a experimental defense system that requires an extremely rare mineral in order to work. Investigations prove that the only known source of this mineral is in the Soviet Union, but it is known that around the turn of the century a miner exported some of the mineral. Hopes are dashed when it is learned that he transported the mineral aboard the Titanic. But perhaps the Titanic can be salvaged.</p>
<p>To obtain a supply of a rare mineral, a ship raising operation is conducted for the only known source, the Titanic.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Special effects in 1980 weren't what they are in 2002 obviously. This film is rather laughable in terms of pyrotechnics when you compare it to, let us say James Cameron's film (by the way this film was made five years before they found the real Titanic so they had no way of knowing the ship broke in two before it went down). I saw this film as a kid and enjoyed it (I enjoy anything having to do with the Titanic). I remember that summer of 1980 there was a big ad build up for it, the last great human adventure is about to begin. This is a good suspense film, although they would have been better off following Cussler's novel more closely especially in character develpment. Cussler was reportedly so angry at this film he forbid them to make anymore from his novels which is a damn shame. Dirk Pitt is a fine hero in the James Bond mold. The scene where the ship is "raised" is handled rather well. I read something that was kind of funny, the producers spent a fortune building an elaborate studio tank for the model they "raised" then found out they didn't make it big enough. Anne Archer is rather wasted in this film, shes a fine actress who deserved better. The great Alec Guiness has an amusing cameo. He was always such a loveable old ham.</p>
