<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This top-notch comedy western is both entertaining and unforgettable. Its stellar cast of veteran American actors present a magnificent example of ensemble acting. Burgess Meredith in particular turns in a virtuoso performance. Henry Fonda, Joanne Woodward and Jason Robards anchor the film with delightful portrayals. The surprise plot twist at the end does jar the emotions a little, but is in keeping with the fun and mischievous spirit of the film. Definitely more stylish and funnier than "The Sting". Action, adventure, comedy, suspense ----- this well-crafted tale has it all. It deserves the term "classic".</p>
