<h1>The Raging Tide (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A San Francisco hood is rubbed out by rival Bruno Felkin, who himself reports the crime to Homicide Lieut. Kelsey in an alibi scheme which fails. To escape, he stows away on a fishing boat. At sea, skipper Hamil Linder receives Bruno kindly, teaching him fishing; Bruno enlists Hamil's wayward son Carl to tend his slot machines. Then Carl takes an interest in Bruno's girl Connie. Climax in a storm at sea.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not truly a Film Noir, "The Raging Tide" works pretty well as a good B-movie. There are fine performances from Richard Conte, Stephen McNally, Alex Nichol and Shelley Winters. Charles Bickford doing a Swedish accent is a bit hard to swallow, but he has been great elsewhere. The film opens with a very noirish sequence and may disappoint those looking for a real entry in that much-discussed, hard-to-pin-down genre. But there is enough melodrama to entertain all but the most demanding viewers.</p>
