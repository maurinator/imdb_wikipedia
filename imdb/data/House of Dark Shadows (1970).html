<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Intelligently done, but bloody and violent story based on the hit TV show Dark Shadows from the late 60s.  The plot revolves around vampire Barnabas Collins, who finds a cure to become human again so he can wed a beautiful girl.  Genuinely creepy atmosphere, beautifully filmed and surprisingly first-rate acting by cast.</p>
