<h1>Soldier in the Rain (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sentemental military comedy revolves around two contemporary army buddies, Master Sergeant Maxwell Slaughter (Jackie Gleason), a smooth operator, who supply Sergeant Eustis Clay (Steve McQueen) idolizes and hopes will join him as a civilian in a private business enterprise. Clay endeavors to be a player in the military, just like Slaughter, but it seems as though Clay still has a lot to learn from his mentor. They are joined by Tuesday Weld as a shrill dizzy blonde teenager named Bobby Jo Pepperdine and Tony Bill as bumbling Private First Class Jerry Meltzer, McQueen's screwball sidekick.</p>
<p>The bond of friendship between a worldly-wise Army Master Sergeant and his naive worshiper.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a comedy, drama, buddy movie, love story, tear jerker and coming of age film, all rolled very nicely into one very entertaining film. Gleason usually the comic, is brilliant as Maxwell Slaughter, demonstrating his underappreciated dramatic talents.  McQueen, in a rare comedic role, shines also.  As a pair, they truly can "rule the world".  I give it 10 stars out of 10.  A classic, and one of the best films no one ever heard of.</p>
