<h1>9 to 5 (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Meet Franklin Hart ('Coleman'). The biggest 'sexist egotistical lying hypocritical bigot' boss on the planet. He thrills in taking advantage of his head female office staff; humiliating, downplaying, and condescending against them whenever conveniently possible, particularly his top assistant Violet ('Tomlin'). Long exhausted over his gruesome bullishness, Violet, alongside coworkers Doralee ('Parton') and Judy ('Fonda') comprise comical methods of "doing him in", when a freak incident occurs. They then manage to kidnap Hart and trap him in his own house, while assuming control of his department, and productivity leaps. But just how long can they keep him tied up?</p>
<p>Three female employees of a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot find a way to turn the tables on him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this movie on HBO around 1981.  Now, as I re-watch it again for the 20th time, it still has me laughing at all the hysterical lines, "....change you from a rooster to a hen....", "....gruesome but cute....", "It looks just like Skinny & Sweet....I might as well save them the trouble and give them the rat poison....", and all the rest of this wildly funny movie.This movie is timeless.  Including all the actors who are the perfect choice for this movie.This comedy is a definite 10 out of 10!!!!</p>
