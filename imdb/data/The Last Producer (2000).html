<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Burt Reynolds plays an aging Hollywood producer. Knowing that he is soon going to die or not to have anymore importance, he bets all he has, all his love for the cinema, all his strengh, in doing his last movie, his best work, something for which he wants the people to remember him by...</p>
<p>An old-time mogul struggles to reenter the club where power and money make the rules.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Burt Reynolds was so wrong in this part.  We are supposed to believe he is an over the hill producer but his "plastic surgery" leads us to believe he is in much better shape.Would have been a good story with the right direction and cast.</p>
