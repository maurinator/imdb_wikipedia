<h1>The Ruling Class (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A member of the House of Lords dies in a shockingly silly way, leaving his estate to his son. Unfortunately, his son is insane: he thinks he is Jesus Christ. The other somewhat-more respectable members of their family plot to steal the estate from him. Murder and mayhem ensues.</p>
<p>Following Lord Ralph Gurney's accidental death, his son Jack Gurney inherits his estate including his title, the Earl of Gurney. Jack has been away for seven years, having no contact with his extended family during that time. He believes he was at a monastery. In reality, he was in a psychiatric hospital as a voluntary patient - voluntary at his father's request - as, as a paranoid schizophrenic, he believes that he is Jesus Christ in leading a movement for eternal love, the latter issue of all men being equal which may be more problematic for his family who are part of the so-called ruling class than his belief of being God. In his own words, when he prays to God, he hears himself. Any of life's problems he places inside his virtual "galvanized pressure cooker". His paternal uncle and his family are most concerned about Jack taking over the peerage and the vast estate, and what that will do to the historic Gurney name. Competing interests in the family work toward two opposing possible options to deal with the situation: to have anyone that they can manipulate with a Gurney name take over, at which time they can recommit him for good; or to see if his long standing psychiatrist at the hospital, Dr. Herder, can cure him by getting him to face reality. Jack may, however, throw them all for a loop.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>British `dark comedy' was possibly as its zenith with this rich Peter O'Toole offering by director Peter Medak. O'Toole is Jack Gurney, the youngest and `somewhat eccentric' heir to the House of Gurney.  He suddenly finds himself being forced by his late father's will into taking up his role in British society - assuming the family seat in the House of Lords.  The biggest problem is not that the late Earl of Gurney has just accidentally hung himself wearing a cocked hat and a ballet skirt, or that Jack has just released himself from `hospital' where the doctors were treating his `nerves.'  No the biggest problem is that, on a good day, the new 14th Earl of Gurney thinks he's Jesus Christ and, on a bad day, he thinks he's Jack the Ripper!And if that mix of the macabre doesn't make you chuckle, try this unexpected twist.  At several poignant moments throughout the film, the cast will suddenly break from straight-faced dialogue into a full-blown, song and dance numbers, some of which would make Busby Berkley proud.  In one case, the tune of `Connect 'dem Bones' is ushered up to punctuate a scene with O'Toole lecturing the local gentry about the need for capital punishment. Herein lies one of the big reasons why this film is so off-the-wall and refreshingly funny.For my money, this is one of the most original, thought-provoking and honest critiques of the British class system ever to be put on film.  O'Toole is simply mesmerizing as he juggles Jack's multiple personalities, the funniest of which is Christ or, as he prefers it, `J.C.' It's hysterical to watch the cumulative effect of J.C.'s `touched' outlook on the members in his stuffy, conspiring family who are out to get Jack committed permanently.A true `Must See Film' for anyone who enjoys a juicy, sardonic, intelligent black comedy, especially when the topic focuses on the silly pomposity of the British upper classes.</p>
