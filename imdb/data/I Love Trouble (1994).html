<h1>I Love Trouble (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Veteran reporter Peter Brackett is enjoying new found fame after his book, "White Lies" is published. When he is asked by his newspaper "The Chicago Chronicle" to report on a train crash, he notices new reporter Sabrina Peterson. Brackett's complacency gets rudely shocked by Peterson's report for the rival "Chicago Globe." What follows next is a mad race between the reporters who then cook up possible events that lead up to the crash. After an initial spate of mad reporting, both settle down to get the facts straight, which leads them to uncover opposing information. When each gets setup to be killed at the same place, they escape, and then agree to work together. While they initially do not trust one another, they eventually come to work together to uncover the truth behind the train crash.</p>
<p>She's green and eager. He's seasoned and jaded. They're reporters for rival Chicago newspapers assigned to cover the same story. He offers tips and advice; she scoops him. Then, their snappy patter, repartee, and ripostes get romantic even as their competitive juices overflow. Will corrupt scientists at a chemical company whose goats give cancer-causing milk kill the cub and the columnist, or will they escape with their lives and their by-lines to hear wedding bells?</p>
<p>Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson are two competing Chicago newspaper reporters who join forces to unravel the mystery behind a train derailment.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bland and unimaginative but many films are that what really drags this down is not the lack of chemistry between the leads but the transparent loathing they have for each other. The production of this was notoriously contentious between Roberts and Nolte and their utter abhorrence is something that seeps out of every frame of the movie. Sometimes that can fuel a set and make the picture better, as it did on I Married a Witch where Veronica Lake and Fredric March's mutual animosity somehow translated into a kinetic on screen chemistry, such is not the case here however it just makes an already weak picture that much worse. A good supporting cast and decent production values aren't enough to save this turkey. It stinks!</p>
