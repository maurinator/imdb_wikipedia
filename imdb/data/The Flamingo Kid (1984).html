<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At first glance, 1984's "The Flamingo Kid" looks like a coming-of-age beach flick. What occasionally attracts me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the babes. It brings one back in time to the carefree time of his/her coming-of-age years. What surprised me is that "The Flamingo Kid" is more than just a youth beach flick.The story takes place in the early 60s where 18-year-old Matt Dillon, a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the beach club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blond and becomes fascinated by a new mentor, fast-talking businessman and cardshark Richard Crenna.Crenna convinces Dillon that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Dillon moves out of his house and cancels his college plans it naturally creates some serious friction with his father. Will Dillon go on to become the next generation's fast-talking businessman/cardshark in the mold of Crenna or will he see the error of such an enticing lifestyle? Almost the entire film was shot on location at an Atantic beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Dillon's girlfriend in the story, Janet Jones. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.The bottom line is that "The Flamingo Kid" offers everything you'd want in such a film and more, including a truly interesting story in which you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there's NO RAUNCH. In addition the soundtrack includes numerous early 60's hits like "Runaround Sue," etc. What's not to like? Runtime: 100 minutes GRADE: A-</p>
