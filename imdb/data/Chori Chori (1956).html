<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That Raj Kapoor and Nargis made a great on screen couple is corroborated by this "It happened one night" inspired flick. Nargis is near perfect as the snobbish heiress on the run. She runs away from a caring father who puts his foot down when she wants to marry a playboy (Pran). Enroute she meets Raj Kapoor, a reporter who wants to do an exclusive on her journey. After the initial bickering and animosity, they fall in love. And after a big misunderstanding , everything gets sorted out in the end. Shankar Jaikishen come up with a score which has a winner in very number. Raj Kapoor is excellent and so is Nargis. Very very watchable.</p>
