<h1>Boris Godunov (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Action happens at the end of the 16th century, on the eve of "time of troubles". The main character of this historical tragedy - the Russian tsar Boris Godunov who has ascended to a throne after Ivan the Terrible after tragic events: death of the eldest son of Grozny Fedor and death of the young tsarevitch Dimitrii.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even all the years since this movie was made have not diminished what a powerful production it is. The number of sets that are either faithful reproduction or on actual location make the film a wonderful viewing experience. The music, of course, has always been one of my favorite. Even though I prefer the Rimsky-Korsakov version as being more operatically dramatic, this second version of Mussorgsky gets cut down in some instances (Pimen's monologue, the inkeeper song shortened, Boris' children's songs cut down or out) but none of this robs the spectacle that is presented to you as a film of the opera.</p>
