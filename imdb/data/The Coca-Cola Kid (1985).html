<h1>The Coca-Cola Kid (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An eccentric marketing guru visits a Coca-Cola subsidiary in Australia to try and increase market penetration. He finds zero penetration in a valley owned by an old man who makes his own soft drinks, and visits the valley to see why. After "the Kid's" persistence is tested he's given a tour of the man's plant, and they begin talking of a joint venture. Things get more complicated when the Coca-Cola man begins falling in love with his temporary secretary, who seems to have connections to the valley.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lots of local (Australian) colour and fun being made of corporate America. This is what we like. :-)It's about 10 years since I last saw the film and I still sometimes finding myself humming the song, "choke back the tears when there's no Coca-Cola".Not a great film, but another welcome Aussie comedy.</p>
