<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>*The cast: Antonio Banderas : Art / Bart DodgeDaryl Hannah: Liz KernerMelanie Griffith: BettyJoan Cusack: Gloria Eli Wallach: Sheldon*The story: Art Dodge is an art swindler. He looks at the death announcements in the papers. At the day of the funeral, thÃªn he goes to the family and says that the dead person had bought a painting of him a few weeks before he died. At that moment, he meets Betty a rich woman who divorced the same man twice. They fall in love with each other, but love becomes complicated when Art meets Betty's sister... he is deeply in love with her too. So he decides to transform himself in Bart (his twin brother) and then you get some humoristic moments, which aren't very funny at some moments. Sheldon is the father of Art. Joan Cusack is the employee of Art.An interesting note is that Melanie and Antonio fall in love on the set, and they married and had 1 child, Stella Banderas. *Appreciation: This film is too confusing and although Daryl Hannah played her part wonderfully, the film has something of a disaster. Although the actors did their best to make a comedy. A catastrophe occurredBut don't forget that alL these actors had done some wonderful acting. Some examples; Melanie Griffith: Cecil B. Demented -- Daryl Hannah: Steel Magnolias -- Antonio Banderas: Philadelphia and Eli Wallach: the Misfits.Sadly they made this time a wrong choice... Mostly I like the movies that I saw and on the whole I give good comments about them. But this time I can only say that this film was a big disappointment and I hoped that it would have finished quickly. However I didn't lose my faith in the actors because it was just the wrong script that didn't work. Rating: 5,5 /10</p>
