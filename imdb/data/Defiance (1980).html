<h1>Defiance (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tommy takes up temporary housing in a New York neighborhood plagued by a violent gang called the Souls. Tommy is waiting for his next assignment as a seaman and though he tries to avoid the gang and his neighbors, it does not work. Soon he is battling the Souls and not only changing their attitudes, but the attitudes of his previously intimidated neighbors as well.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This entertaining but often overlooked film stars Jan-Michael Vincent as a seaman who must temporarily reside on the tough, crime-filled and gang-infested streets of New York, where he is persuaded by fearful residents to join them in their war against "The Souls," a local Puerto Rican gang led by Angel Cruz (played by the underrated Rudy Ramos, who would later work on "Quicksilver" (1985) with Kevin Bacon). "Defiance" was filmed mostly in New York's East Village (specifically on 12th Street between Avenue A and B) at a time when street gangs did in fact control that particular area of Lower Manhattan. This film brings to mind the highly controversial release "The Warriors" (1979), about a group of young fighters framed by a rival gang. Director John Flynn is dead on with the emotional aspect of the film, capturing the heart-wrenching struggle between good and evil, the romance between Tommy (Vincent) and Marsha (Theresa Saldana) and the brutal and poignant deaths of two characters - Whacko (Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi in "The Godfather" (1972)) and Abe (Art Carney). Highly recommended for cult film enthusiasts. I would love to see a DVD edition in the near future by MGM/UA (formerly Orion).</p>
