<h1>Breakout (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Drama set in an Italian prisoner of war camp during World War 2, where a group of British soldiers find their plans for escape thwarted by a mysterious traitor in their midst.</p>
<p>In 1943, an Italian-administered POW camp for captured Allies goes through a series of failed escapes only to culminate in a daring plan for a literally-dramatic mass escape.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just watched it on Channel 4 and loved it, very good cast and overall very enjoyable.Full of great actors including Richard Attenborough and Tony Todd A bit different from the usual escape movies, in that there's some intrigue and tension caused by a informer within the British ranks this results in the deaths of 4 British prisoners before they finally work out who it is.I do like the 50/60 British films and this is another that i will definitely watch again.</p>
