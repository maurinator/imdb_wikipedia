<h1>The Pajama Game (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Employees of the Sleeptite Pajama Factory are looking for a whopping seven-and-a-half cent an hour increase and they won't take no for an answer. Babe Williams is their feisty employee representative but she may have found her match in shop superintendent Sid Sorokin. When the two get together they wind up discussing a whole lot more than job actions!</p>
<p>Myron Hasler, Vice-President of the Sleeptite Pajama Company, hires Sid Sorokin, new to town, as the company's new factory superintendent, with who the union workers on the floor will have to deal. Sid, in negotiations with the union, primarily has to deal with "Prez", the union President, and Katie Williams - Babe to her friends - the chair of the union's grievance committee. Babe does her union job well as she can tell how legitimate her member's claims are and how hard to push for them against management. Despite their professional management-union struggles, both Sid and Babe are attracted to each other, something that Sid is more willing to recognize than Babe. But their professional lives and their personal lives may not be able to mix, especially as the union has an outstanding grievance for an across-the-board 7½¢ per hour wage increase, which would bring their wages in line with the industry standard. Despite the company doing good business, Hasler has thus far refused them the raise, blaming the Board of Directors who have to approve it. This standoff could ruin any chance of a personal relationship between Babe and Sid, unless this problem is resolved, which doesn't look like will happen without drastic measures on one or both sides.</p>
<p>An Iowa pajama factory worker falls in love with an affable superintendent who had been hired by the factory's boss to help oppose the workers' demand for a pay rise.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even with three numbers from the Broadway production missing, and even with some lyrics sanitized for middle-America, "The Pajama Game" remains one of the most successful stage-to-screen transitions.  Except for Doris Day stepping in for Janis Paige, all the principals of the Broadway production are also aboard.  You can compare for yourself Day's performance to Paige's (if you can get your hands on the original cast recording) but it's not hard to understand the producers' choice to go with at least one movie box office name.  In old man Hasler's words, it's a "COMPROMISE!""The Pajama Game" is (with one unfortunate exception) unapologetically stagy.  And why apologize?  By keeping the feel of a stage production the movie preserves the flavor of the  performances.  Reta Shaw and Eddie Foy Jr. team up for a winning soft shoe routine in "I'll Never Be Jealous Again."  "Racing With the Clock" benefits from dolly shots that open up the number without closing out the visual ironies.The unfortunate exception is "Once a Year Day," which takes to the not-so-great outdoors to destroy a once-great production number.  The legendary Bob Fosse choreography is badly served by a multiplicity of camera angles that actually dilute the dancing.  Oh, well.Luckily, there is "Steam Heat," completely undiluted, offering Fosse as one of the dancers.I am now about to make myself feel very old by saying (oh, dear):  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  But, you see, they can't because Broadway doesn't make 'em like this anymore except in revival.  Wait, let me sing it: "The nostalgia game/ is the game I'm in/ And I'm proud to be/ in the nostalgia game/ I love it..."And I love this movie.  Don't miss it if you can.</p>
