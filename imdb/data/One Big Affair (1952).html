<h1>One Big Affair (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jean Harper, a Pomona school teacher on vacation, is taking a bus tour through Mexico. Bored, she misses the bus and soon finds herself looking at Jimmy Donovan...30 years old and six feet high, and she thinks he is better to look at than ruins 1000 years old and 900 feet high. He is a high-priced divorce lawyer, also on vacation, and bicycling his way to Acapulco to "stay out of trouble." Thus begins a tour of Mexico by bus, bicycle, ox-cart and by foot and, before they reach Acapulco, he is accused of kidnapping Jean and both become the object of a nation-wide search. They also get adopted, along the way, by a whimsical Mexican orphan boy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Certainly not a work of art, but a little underrated. The story is thin and contrived, but really no more so than many highly regarded films. The writing has some nice moments and is pretty amusing in parts, especially the scenes involving the "Mexican cousins." This was the first film I have seen with Evelyn Keyes. She is compelling in an unusual way. Reading some background about her made it all the more interesting. Regarded as a perennial B- movie actress, she certainly had a fascinating Hollywood life, and her performance here is never bad and at at times very appealing. The movie also features some good character performances, especially the boy-crazy Mary Anderson and the very-Brooklyn Connie Gilchrest. All in all, an entertaining movie in my opinion. They can't all be award winners, and this one isn't, but it is light and pleasant.</p>
