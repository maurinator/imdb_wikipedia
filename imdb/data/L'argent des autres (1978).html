<h1>L'argent des autres (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bank executive Rainier allows his firm to deliver adventurous investor Chevalier d'Aven a huge loan, with what he thinks is his employer Mirement's total backing. Chevalier's business proves indeed to be disastrous, which forces the bank to cover up its high deficits. News of the scandal breaks out, and the bank now sees Rainier as the one being responsible for it - he is laid off. Wife Celine and union representative Arlette suggest he should sue his former boss.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Christian de Challonges has always been drawn to the fantastic.One of his works ("l 'alliance" probably his best) is pure fantasy ,another one ("Malevil") tackles sci-fi with mixed results.Even "le bel été 14" sometimes verges on something eerie."L'argent des autres" is a different matter since it reportedly tells a true story.However Challonges' treatment is downright disturbing.The scene where Trintignant is dismissed is given a supernatural treatment in a candlelit room.Another when he is waiting for a new job in a huge white room recalls Kubrik's "clockwork orange" .The questioning he's subject to when applying for a new job is icily impersonal ,you'd think that those people aren't flesh and blood ."L'argent des autres" ,nevertheless does not really interest me.Only the scene in the courtroom where the small savers discover that they've been fooled really moves me.After all "l'argent des autres" means "the others' money" and the others are those small investors.Biggest flaw: Challonges reduces Catherine Deneuve to an extra.</p>
