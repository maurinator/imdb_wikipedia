<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I first watched this film, I really wasn't sure whether I liked it or not but after careful thinking and being honest with myself I have to admit that I like it.  I have never seen such a tender portrayal than the one played by Robert Preston.  He is in rare form.  I was also very moved by Jean Simmons's character and the interaction she had with the other characters, especially the ones dealing with God, life and death. Aline MacMahon was a real inspiration in this film as Aunt Hannah--I had never before seen her in a movie to my knowledge and yet I really had and still do have the feeling that no one could have played Hannah as well as Miss MacMahon did.  This film is about life, its ups and downs, tragedies and triumphs, reality and the choice of giving up or going on.  This one's a real treat and blessing!</p>
