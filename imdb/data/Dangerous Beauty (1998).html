<h1>Dangerous Beauty (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 16th century Venice, courtesans enjoy unique privileges: dressed richly in red, they read, compose poetry and music, and discuss affairs of state with the men who govern the Republic. When Veronica Franco comes of age, she cannot marry Marco Venier, whom she loves, because she is well born but penniless. Her choice: cloister or courtesan. She steels her heart, and with beauty and intelligence becomes the best. She's a heroine when she helps convince France to aid Venice in war with Turks, but when plague descends, the Church charges her with witchcraft. At her inquisition, she must match wits with an old rival, speak for all women, and call courage from Venier.</p>
<p>A Venetian courtesan becomes a hero to her city, but later becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While there have been several recent films about courageous women of the past whether true or imaginary, Dangerous Beauty, a quality effort with individuality, is a welcome addition to this group. A story of some historical sweep, wit and romance, we are first drenched in the sunlight and beauty of Venice. As the film builds I was impressed by the talent, charm and strength of the hero, Veronica Franco, poet and courtesan. Through two amazing events she saves Venice twice first by getting help to defend itself from invasion and later by standing up for its spirit of independence. Intertwined with this is a touching romance made bitter sweet by the pressures of arranged marriages, the terrible limitations upon women and the twisted power of envy. This film works on many levels, the photography and music are top notch as are the settings and costumes. The acting is fine including the main roles played by Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell. (Just don't expect Blanchette and Joseph Fienes.) If you like historical dramas with romance, intrigue and lovely scenery then I strongly recommend Dangerous Beauty.</p>
