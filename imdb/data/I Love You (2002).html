<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I Love You is a 4 minute short film produced by 824 Pictures. Apparently it's also the third in a collection of shorts. It's beautiful to look at, the editing is good and the imagery and presentation is great. An excellent piece of film-making it is, but what it lacks is a concise story. Although lacking a concise story, it's hard to hold that against a 4 minute short.I Love You takes place in a bathroom where a man and a woman converse. However, you can't really call it a conversation as the only phrase ever muttered is 'I love you'. The almost never-ending phrase repetition, coupled with quick cuts, blends the way an acid trip might and although the inflection differs from anger, to laughter or maybe even sincerity, it's still repeated almost to death. This, I imagine, is the point. But here's the problem: where do you take it now? And without ruining the 'story', I'll just say that it gets sinister and wicked, and ultimately confusing. Perhaps it was intended to be a metaphor of our life and love, or perhaps it was just a cheap shot for shock factor. I took it as the latter.All in all, I Love You was really interesting to look at and watch. Now that phrase might sound repetitious but I mean exactly that: the color and shot composition were beautiful and the editing was cool to watch (plus the girl is a cutie). However, 4 minutes may actually be too much time for this particular point to be made. Regardless, it held my attention to the end.3/5 Little Guys -</p>
