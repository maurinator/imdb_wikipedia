<h1>The Critic (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mel Brooks is an old man watching abstract animations. He doesn't understand them, so he heckles with strange commentary, to the annoyance of those around him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Oscar-winning 4-minute cartoon beat the recently-viewed AUTOMANIA 2000 (1963), which I had rated ***1/2! That said, it is a classic and undeniably original. The premise could not be simpler: a grumpy critic on the soundtrack  voiced by a pre-stardom Mel Brooks!  assesses a variety of shapes that come up on the screen. He is understandably exasperated by their constant striving for attention or, if you like, to create meaning (which is often indecipherable anyway!) out of nonsense. It is a pretty sharp and witty jab at art-house cinema, then in something of a worldwide creative peak, which found the adulation of intellectual film reviewers but were deemed pretentious by  and went over the heads of  mainstream American audiences. Conversely, however, this can also be seen as an indictment of the unsophisticated tastes of casual moviegoers.</p>
