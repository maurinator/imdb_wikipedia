<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Fugitive is the biggest heart-pounding thriller I have seen in a while (and the best one this decade).  The story revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford to pythagorean procision.  Kimble is accused of killing his wife and is chased all over Chicago by Marshalls while looking for his wife's one armed killer.  One of these Marshalls is Samuel Gerarg (Tommy Lee Jones terrific and Oscar nod performance) who after a while believes he is innocent. Spectacularly done in the tradition of crime/drama thrillers with Ford and Jones working better together than ever before.  I found this film to be the best film experience of the early 90's, and hopefully you will too.  A++</p>
