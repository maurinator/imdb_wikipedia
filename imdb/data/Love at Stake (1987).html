<p>In this spoof inspired by the Salem witch trials the town's mayor and the judge agree to sentence several innocent townspeople to death for witchcraft in order to confiscate their land for themselves. However, sexy real witches show up.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is hilarious! I can't believe it only rated 4.8/10! This is definitely a "B" movie, but there are a lot of very good "B" movies out there. I mean, every scene is funny. Anyone who enjoys "neo-slapstick" comedy should LOVE this, especially fans of Monthy Python, the "Fletch" movies, or even Benny Hill, will love this movie! And hey, it has John Travolta's wife in it & Barbara Carerra (sic?)! Not to mention, "Doug" McKenzie from the Great White North. I can definitely tell there is some SNL influence here. The old lady (mother of the struck-blind preacher) is hilarious, not to mention the songs! Definitely rent this movie if you haven't seen it. And if you have, BUY IT, if you can find it!</p>
