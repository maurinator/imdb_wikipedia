<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great gritty low budget movie from a fabled small boutique studio Allied Artists which had a great run with films such as Love In The Afternoon, Friendly Persuasion, El Cid, Papillion and Cabaret, et al and film directors such as William Wyler, John Huston, Billy Wilder and stars such as Ava Gardner, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn, Steve McQueen, Sophia Loren. Young Dillinger is a wonderful movie directed by Robert Wilson who also did a fine racetrack drama at Warner Bros called Wall of Noise that starred Ty Hardin, Dorothy Provine, Ralph Meeker and Suzy Pleshette. Robert Wilson cast his movies well! In Young Dillinger, Nick Adams and Bob Conrad star along with former Ms America Mary Ann Mobley and a great cameo by Victor Buono. There isn't much more to say about this fine film but to see it if and when you can!</p>
