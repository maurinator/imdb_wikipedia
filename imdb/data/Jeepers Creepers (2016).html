<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That was...wow... I ... I loved it! I thought that this episode would be dull after last week's awesome episode, I was wrong! There's a lot of shocking moments in this episode. Brooke is one of the best characters in this episode. Audrey and Noah's scenes are amazing! Bex and john are the two best actors on this show. No Eli this week, Maybe that's a good thing. Willa didn't bother me in this episode..Best character this episode = Audrey/Noah. .Worst character this episode = Aunt Tina. .Best scenes = Audrey and Noah's .Worst scene = Aunt Tina and Mayor Maddox</p>
