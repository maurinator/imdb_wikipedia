<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Leo is a 28 year old writer who doesn't have any friends because he finds normal people too shallow and so he hasn't found love. After an arguing with his mother he leaves into the night where he accidentally meets a group of poets, artists and philosophers who drag him to a subterranean bar where Yuri, a vagabond poet, introduces him to Mardou a beautiful blonde girl. Leo goes with the young beatnik group to every subterranean bar in San Francisco. Immediately Leo and Mardou fall in love with each other and he promises her a life together forever but their love starts to strangle Leo's ability to write. One night, out of rage, Leo snaps and has an affair with Roxanne. Mardou disappears for four days because she thinks Leo is very childish, which takes Leo to heavy drinking until she re-appears with the news that she's pregnant and they declare their love with each other by leaving the new bohemian group to be alone and start a normal life together.</p>
<p>A love story between two misunderstood new bohemians who don't even understand themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hooray I thought, another San Francisco movie that TnT shows from time to time and I can't think of a better place to set a beat generation based production than here. The good news is that there is plenty of location shots set around the North Beach/Telegraph Hill exteriors but bad that most of the interiors are the usual Paramount style back lots that just oozes, well, not authenticity anyway. the acting style is labored and theatrical almost like pantomime and if you think of a less plausible West Side Story with the singing removed you would be pretty close to what can be seen here. The acting particularly from the female lead is over the top whiny and mostly unsympathetic making this a movie to watch but with the sound turned down.</p>
