<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great kung fu movie once you get the opening done with. The storyline is fairly confusing in the beginning, but that passes with time. The fight scenes are neat to watch, but they get exponentially better as time goes on. The fight with Gordon Liu (36th Chamber) is good and the final fight WAS FANTASTIC! This isn't a movie to sit down and watch for the stimulation. The character development isn't as good as FIVE VENOMS, or SWORDSMAN II, but it's fair. The weapons fighting is just unbelievable in the last fight scene. All in all, if you are a fan of kung-fu movies, get around to checking this one out. The three-section-staff work is even better than in 36th Chamber.</p>
