<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two twelve-year-old boys, Romeo and Gavin, undergo an extraordinary test of character and friendship when Morell, a naive but eccentric and dangerous stranger, comes between them. Morell befriends with the two boys and later asks them to help him pursue Romeo's beautiful elder sister. He gradually becomes more violent after she rejects him ...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>To say Paddy Considine played the role Morell is a GROSS understatement. The director made wise choice in casting the part. Morell, the town weirdo, wasn't just an important part of the movie, HE WAS THE MOVIE!!! From his first scene to his last, the character grabs your attention and never let's go. Whether it's his of the wall (and mostly unintentional) humor, or his dark yet tormented behavior, Morell (Considine) clearly establishes himself as an integral part of the film. Consinde's ability to generate humor, fear, disdain and sympathy for Morell, makes him a talented actor to watch for in future projects! I highly recommend this film.</p>
