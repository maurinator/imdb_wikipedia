<h1>Monster on the Campus (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A college professor acquires a newly discovered specimen of a prehistoric fish. While examining the find he is accidentally exposed to it's blood, turning him into a murderous Neanderthal.</p>
<p>Professor Donald Blake, a paleontologist at Dunsfield University, finally receives a rare fish, a coelacanth, from Madagascar. This species has remained unchanged for a million years and is in effect a living fossil. The animal arrives frozen but after accidentally cutting himself on the creature's sharp teeth, Blake puts his hand in the melted ice water. Later, Molly Riordan is found dead in Blake's backyard. The police initially suspect Blake but fingerprints suggest that there was a third person at Blake's house. Blake's contact with the fish transforms him into a hideous creature, a prehistoric man - and soon dead bodies are appearing on campus.</p>
<p>The blood of a primitive fish exposed to gamma rays causes a benign research professor to regress to an ape-like, bloodthirsty prehistoric hominid.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A previous commentator writes that: "The story is totally ludicrous and a feeble, shameless attempt to promote evolution. Only a leftist loony would believe this stuff."Just to set the record straight, the concept of "evolution" promoted by the film is a gross distortion of actual evolutionary theory, suggesting as it does that evolution involves some sort of mystical forces and that certain so-called "living fossils" contain some sort of substance which somehow counteracts these forces. None of this actually makes in any sense, however, in terms of the actual science. To sum up, evolutionary theory is perfectly valid science, and there's nothing particularly shameful about promoting it as science, contrary to what the above poster might think. OTOH, the movie's conception of what evolution actually means is just plain silly.</p>
