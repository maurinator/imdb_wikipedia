<h1>Prehistoric Women (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tigri (Laurette Luez, working her way up to Bomba and Bowery Boys films) and her stone-age girl friends hate all men, but realizing they are a necessary evil, capture some for potential (strictly business, no recreation allowed) husbands. Engor (Allan Nixon, working his way down to the Mesa of Lost Women) escapes and, in his travels, discovers fire. This comes in handy later, after he has been recaptured by the women, when he drives off a dragon, or something, with his new discovery. This little feat has the effect of making the women realize their rightful subservient position, and he and Tigri have a primitive (non-catered) wedding, and go off to start a new tribe of fur-wearers.</p>
<p>Sadly, I just watched "Prehistoric Women" (1950). The listed plot summary is correct but incomplete. It may (or may not) be worth adding that after inventing fire, Engor (accidentally) roasts his fresh catch from a hunt and thereby invents the first outdoor BBQ. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>A civilization of gorgeous cavewomen abduct men for mating purposes. One of their victims is Engor, who seems to be smarter than the rest of the men. He discovers fire, battles a monstrous giant and attempts to win the hand of the prehistoric queen.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Comparable, I think, to Wiesmuller's Tarzan flicks, Prehistoric Women is honestly kind of good. The voice over, done documentary style, helps. The segments done with stuffed animals are hilarious by todays standards. Its like Tarzan wrestles Lavern and Shirley's BooBoo kitty. The prehistoric women? Champions of women's liberation and really pretty both at the same time. The photography? Decent given what they had to work with back then. The plot? Hey, there actually IS one. Even a sub plot. Characters? They function. Especially the nine foot tall rampaging giant, who is so obviously misunderstood. I'm kidding. But I'm NOT kidding when I say that if you like Tarzan style flicks from that era you'll enjoy Prehistoric Women.</p>
