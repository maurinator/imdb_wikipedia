<h1>Fire Down Below (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Trough a dodgy middleman, Salmoneus buys the forbidden treasure which king Ores received from Hera as a reward and test before Hercules deposed him. Each time pieces sold 'in sacrilege' turn up, Hera's henchmen have an excuse to strike. Hercules takes them on, even the terrible Pyro, who consists on rapidly moving fire.</p>
<p>Salmoneus is set up with treasure stolen from Hera. When Hercules convinces Nemesis that Salmoneus is innocent, Hera sends a deadly creature of fire to eliminate all three of them.</p>
