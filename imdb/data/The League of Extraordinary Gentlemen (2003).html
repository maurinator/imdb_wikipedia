<h1>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Renowned adventurer Allan Quatermain leads a team of extraordinary figures with legendary powers to battle the technological terror of a madman known as "The Fantom." This "League" comprises seafarer/inventor Captain Nemo, vampiress Mina Harker, an invisible man named Rodney Skinner, American secret service agent Tom Sawyer, the ageless and invincible Dorian Gray, and the dangerous split personality of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p>In this adventure, the Fantom is trying to start a World War, and be at the head of it. The Fantom has highly superior weapons to the normal weapons of that day, and he also has extreme cunning, as we see by his tricking the countries into suspecting each other for war-mongering. A supposed loyalist to her Majesty's Empire is sent to fetch Allan Quatermain in an effort to track down the group who is trying to start the war. In a private and secret meeting, Quatermain meets who he is to be teaming up with on this mission. He is accompanied by Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Rodney Skinner, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Henry Jekyll (also Mr. Edward Hyde). Soon into their adventure they discover that the Fantom is behind these attacks, but there is more to this war than battle and cunning.</p>
<p>It's 1899 and 'The Fantom' is trying to start a World War. The job of preventing this from occurring is given to Allan Quatermain. During the briefing with 'M', Quatermain discovers that he will be working alongside a host of various characters, from the Invisible Man and Captain Nemo to Dorian Gray and Dr. Henry Jekyll). Together, they are the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.</p>
<p>In an alternate Victorian Age world, a group of famous contemporary fantasy, SF and adventure characters team up on a secret mission.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Based on the graphic novel of the same name (as noted in the credits), it's no surprise at all to see the movie using similar lighting, colours and action that one would expect to find in a comic book.  The characters are engaging enough, thanks more to the special effects than the actors and the roles they were given.  The far more interesting character of a drug-addicted, wasted Allan Quartermain was sadly watered into the "tragic hero" the Connery plays so well.  Other characters were seemingly better played by their CGI counterparts than the actors supposedly playing them - but one should expect two-dimensional acting in a comic book, and that's exactly what you get. The action is exciting, and a bit intense, if almost too frenetic at times. It's difficult to see all the action at the speeds it's shown, especially with the numerous cutaways to other fights.  Nemo's fights would have been among the most spectacular, had they been slowed down to a speed a normal human could see.  Still the violence is great and appreciable, although with comic-book-like regularity, seldom fatal. If you're a Connery fan, you may find this passable, though not much different from his role in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  Fans of the graphic novel will be sadly disappointed at the startling alterations of their characters, and of course, unsurprised by the "twist" in the middle. Still, it is an enjoyable (if long) two hours, and the attention to detail of the sets, costumes and scenery make it almost worth it alone.</p>
