<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are two movies I have seen in which every line is good and that I can watch dozens of times without becoming the slightest bit bored.  Those are The Big Lebowski and Popeye.  I just saw Popeye recently for the first time in about twelve years and I can still recite it line for line from when I was a kid.  I must have watched it fifty times (It was my babysitter). After I recently watched it, it was on again later that night and I watched it all the way through again.  It's a fantastic movie and I'm blown away that the user rating is so low.</p>
