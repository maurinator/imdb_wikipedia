<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wonderfully executed anime classic.It is a darker anime tale aimed towards a more mature audience.  I enjoyed the amazing realism of this film.  The attention to detail is definitely enjoyable to see.The DVD has a rather enjoyable documentary on the making of the film.  Any fan will enjoy the structure and content of the documentary.  It is quite informative on the process of making the film.Like most Anime, there is a lot of character development and dialogue mixed with stunning visuals.I think the most captivating element that this film has to offer is its creative "cinematography" and attention to detail.  There are numerous memorable shots in this film.This is not an anime for everybody.  Attention to story is critical and I am guilty of rewinding certain areas just to keep up with the story.Thankfully this is not a mindless science-fiction/anime tale filled with crazy action sequences.  The Ghost in the Shell proves to be quite philosophical in nature by questioning the meaning of life.I would love to venture deeper into this story and its message but I think it is better for you interpret it on your own.  Remember to watch this movie with your heart, not with your mind.  Reflect on it later.  This is the best way to enjoy this type of film.</p>
