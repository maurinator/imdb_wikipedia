<h1>My Bloody Valentine (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>There's a big valentine-party planned in the little coal mining town of Valentine Bluffs, Nova Scotia. It is the first Valentine's Day party in 20 years, because then there was an accident in the mine, and the accident happened because the men responsible for the security was at the party. The sole surviving miner, named Harry Warden, later killed them, and told the town NEVER to arrange a Valentine's Day party again. The party begins, and so does the killing...</p>
<p>On Valentine's Day 20 years before, an explosion of methane gas took the lives of a group of coal miners working in the Hanniger Mine near the small Nova Socia town of Valentine Bluffs. The accident occurred because supervisors left their posts to attend the annual Valentine's Day dance. A year afterward, Harry Warden - the only survivor of the accident - retaliated by killing the two supervisors, and leaving a terrifying warning never to hold another Valentine's Day dance. Now, a group of young adults decides to hold another dance, despite warnings. When a blood-soaked heart arrives at the police station, accompanied by an ominous message, the dance is canceled. But a Valentine party is held in its place... at the coal mine, and it isn't long before the town's young people begin dying violently. It appears Harry Warden has returned to punish those who did not heed his warning...</p>
<p>A decades-old folk tale surrounding a deranged murderer killing those who celebrate Valentine's Day turns out to be true to legend when a group defies the killer's order and people start turning up dead.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i had seen this film a couple of times back in the day and had always thought it was a alright 80's slasher but was disappointed by some acting and the gore value, well recently they had released a special edition extended cut of the movie so i picked it up just cause i collect old school horror and thought it would be an alright piece to my collection, well little did i know i was right, there is so much gore that was taken out of this film i was in shock and dumbfounded to know that for 30 years no one has actually really seen this movie. the gore in this is so well done for an 81 film you can definitely tell they were all thinking they had to one up the first Friday the 13th. its a shame the mpaa are such bastards it makes you wonder how many movies you've seen that they butchered like this one. and you leave that movie thinking it was crap when really it was a classic horror that was just heavily edited. well thank god for DVD so if you see the special edition at your store i suggest buying it if your a old school gore fan there is some sick ass special effects that im sure most of the budget of the film was spent on.</p>
