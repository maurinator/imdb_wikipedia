Mary Reilly is seduced by the educated Dr. Jekyll and by the reckless and violent Mr. Hyde."Mary Reilly" is a dramatic and romantic view of the classic story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde through the eyes of a housemaid. The plot is developed in slow pace and is not exactly an horror movie and maybe this is the reason that many viewers did not like this movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Segredo de Mary Reilly" ("The Secret of Mary Reilly")</p>
