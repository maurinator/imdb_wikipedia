<h1>Earth vs. the Spider (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A shy, obsessive comic book fan gets injected with an experimental serum of a lab that is studying how to give humans the abilities of spiders. At first he develops minor abilities such as increased strength, which allows him to fight local criminals and bullies, thus living out his dream of being a superhero, and impressing his attractive next-door neighbor. Things start to get more odd when he is able to shoot webs out of his abdomen. Then he loses control over the force with which he applies his increasingly deadly abilities, as well as his judgment to discern between criminals and jokesters. His dream becomes a nightmare when he starts growing large spider body parts, he's in constant pain, and he develops a nearly insatiable hunger. A detective with a traumatized wife begins investigating when bodies covered in cobwebs and spider venom start piling up.</p>
<p>When a young security guard (Devon Gummarsnall) witnesses his partner get killed he decides to inject himself with a serum hoping to become his favorite comic book hero. When he goes to sleep at night every time he gains a new ability or spider body part which has him in pain. He begins to realize that he may not be becoming what he thinks he is</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow, this movie is just awful.  First off, the spider isn't really vs. the world, the spider goes against Dan Aykroyd (giving a lazy performance). Secondly, the film has lousy special effects, and even worse voice acting.The disappointing thing is, the film actually had me hooked for the first little bit.  I like the concept of a man who thinks he is going to become a super hero, but ultimately ends up becoming a super villain.  It's just too bad the villain is lame, and the hero is....well Dan Aykroyd.2/10</p>
