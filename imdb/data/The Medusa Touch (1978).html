<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Medusa Touch" is a typical seventies "devil conspiracy" movie like the popular "The Exorcist" and "The Omen" series combined with the typical paranoia and disaster movies between "Earthquake" and "Airport". The late Richard Burton plays an obsessed psychic who tries to convince a psychiatrist (Lee Remick) of his demonic power to kill people and to cause disasters just by the strength of his thoughts. Being a victim of an assassination and a coma patient in a hospital, his mad thoughts are causing even worse attacks on buildings that are causing the death of hundreds of people. French cop Lino Ventura, working as a guest policeman in London, tries to find out the mystery of Burton's dark life.Although there's not much action, this horror movie is thrilling and dominated by the convincing performances of the actors. There is a sinister atmosphere of terror and paranoia all around, and you expect the unexpected in every single moment. A fine psychological terror movie in typical seventies style that is worth being watched!</p>
