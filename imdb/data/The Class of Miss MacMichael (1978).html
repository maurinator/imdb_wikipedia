<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think I just sat thru the worst movie ever made. If you are a sucker for dedicated teachers gaining the trust and respect of social misfit students such as To Sir With Love or Up the Down Staircase like I am, you are going to be shocked. There is absolutely nothing to recommend. This movie is just plain insulting. What school has cleaning a cesspool of excrement as a class project. And there really isn't anything worse than making fun of socially retarded students who break wind,a student who flashes his -well you know, and gets a mouse trap castration and another student who thinks he's a gorilla in Africa!. I could go on, but this film is not worth 1000 words. What possessed Rosalind Cash and Michael Murphy to go to England to make this film? For that matter, why did such accomplished actors as Glenda Jackson and Oliver Reed  subject themselves to this atrocious excuse for a comedy? I wonder what they looks on everybody's face was when the film was premiered? Thankfully, this movie was not on AFI's 100 Funniest Films of All Time list. For that, we should just give thanks</p>
