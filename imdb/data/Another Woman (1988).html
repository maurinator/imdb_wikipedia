<h1>Another Woman (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Having recently turned fifty, Marion feels that she has led a so far blessed life. The well-respected Dean of Philosophy at a women's college, she is currently on sabbatical to write her latest book. Although her first husband Sam died tragically fourteen years ago from a mixture of alcohol and pills, she has recently remarried to Ken, who, married at the time, pursued her, while Ken's writer friend, Larry, also professed his love for her. She has a good relationship with her step-daughter Laura, seemingly better than Laura has with either Ken or Laura's own volatile mother, Kathy. Between her and her brother Paul, Marion always had the attention of their academic father. And she and Ken have a wide circle of friends with who they regularly and willingly socialize. But a series of incidents with these people in her life makes Marion wonder about the decisions that she's made, most specifically whether her cerebral and judgmental nature has been alienating to those around her. One of these incidents is the surprise reunion she has with her best childhood friend, an actress named Claire. But arguably the most illuminating incidents involve encounters with Hope, a despondent patient of her workspace neighbor psychiatrist, whose therapy sessions Marion can hear through the building's ventilation system. The questions become if Marion will fully be able to comprehend the extent to which these decisions have negatively affected her life and relationships, and if so if she can make the necessary changes at this stage in her life path to be more fulfilled.</p>
<p>Marion is a woman who has learned to shield herself from her emotions. She rents an apartment to work undisturbed on her new book, but by some acoustic anomaly she can hear all that is said in the next apartment in which a psychiatrist holds his office. When she hears a young woman tell that she finds it harder and harder to bear her life, Marion starts to reflect on her own life. After a series of events she comes to understand how her unemotional attitude towards the people around her affected them and herself.</p>
<p>Facing a mid-life crisis, a woman rents an apartment next to a psychiatrist's office to write a new book, only to become drawn to the plight of a pregnant woman seeking that doctor's help.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just watched this last night, and I've been thinking about it all day.  What an amazing film!  So poignant, so subtle.  A woman re-evaluates her life and begins to lament the choices she made years ago.  Such a simple premise, such immense possibilities.  This film demands a lot of its audience.  There is no humor, no action, and very little plot.  Most people won't be into this at all, I imagine, which is a shame.  This film offers a really wonderful perspective on a subject that is so very rarely addressed in films today: aging.  This film is about a woman taking stock of her life at the age of fifty.  She looks back, she sees the choices she made and how they turned out.  She sees the compromises she made to get where she is today (very successful, head of a philosophy department, about to write another book), and she begins to appreciate, for the first time, what those compromises cost.  This is, in my opinion, the central tragedy of human existence.  You only get one shot at life, and no one ever tells you how to manage it.  So, you make mistakes, and one day, when you're fifty, you've finally learned enough to start making the right choices.  But, by that time, is it too late?  This film doesn't answer that question, at least not for its central character.  But it does offer hope.  The film is propelled by several dynamite performances.  But, even in such a crowded field of great performances, it is not difficult to pick out Gena Rowlands, who gives an unforgettably nuanced performance as Marion, the film's central character.  You may notice that this film is propelled by a number of coincidences.  Every chance encounter, however, has an eerie relevance to Marion's soul-searching.  It may look contrived, but it isn't.  These aren't coincidences at all.  The pregnant woman, played by Mia Farrow, is instrumental in setting up each of these 'coincidences', and that character's name is Hope.  I was half-expecting a "Fight Club" revelation at the end, but it never came, which is good.  This film could stand both ways, and it's better for the director to leave the audience to consider the relationship between Hope and Marion on their own.  Like I said, I've been thinking about it all day.</p>
