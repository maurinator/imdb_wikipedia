<p>After his girl leaves him for someone else, Herbert gets really depressed and starts searching for a job. He finally finds one in a big house which is inhabited by many, many women. Can he live in the same home with all these females?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For good, clean, family laughs, I highly recommend this film.  Skits and cameo appearances fill this delightful entry into the Jerry Lewis film library.  An amazing set is the center piece for this film, with lavishly decorated rooms.</p>
