<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very fine western from the days when MGM ruled Hollywood. It was the premier studio in Hollywood with a great staff of technical professionals and a group of young contract players all of whom would reach stardom, some super stardom: George Peppard, Paula Prentiss, Richard Chamberlain, Yvette Mimieux, George Hamilton, Linda Evans. Jim Hutton, Dolores Hart ( who would become a cloistered nun!) and Luana Patten. et al MGM also had the best and biggest back lot in the Industry and instead of making it a money making venture as Universal did with its back lot, MGM sold the back lot to real estate developers!George Hamilton and Luana Patten of the MGM stock company join Richard Boone in this great tough western. Richard Chamberlain has a small pivotal role but soon would become very famous as Dr. Kildare and reap in more fan mail per week -15,000 letters-than Clark Gable did at his peak at MGM! Richard Chamberlain for a few years was MGM's biggest star.See this movie and enjoy a scenic western with a fine cast.</p>
