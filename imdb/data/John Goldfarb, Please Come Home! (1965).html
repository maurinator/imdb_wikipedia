<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Watching this movie mad me laugh when I was 9 and memories of it still make me laugh today! Not many movies have that ability. It is nonsensical at times. But that was what made it a great movie! I wish they would come out with it on DVD. America needs a good old fashioned laugh movie... Bright colors and funny gags and all. For all of the advances they have made in the movie industry, movies like John Goldfarb stand out as clear, bright and yes maybe a bit unreal. The harem dancing was so funny. I can remember my sisters trying to dance like them. It was a movie the whole family could watch and not worry about certain words...... Virtual Reality comes to mind. haha We lose ourselves enough in the cyber world as it is. John Goldfarb brings us home... Even if he had to get lost to do it.</p>
