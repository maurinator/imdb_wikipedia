<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even if you're not a fan of the great Tim Roth, "Captives" is a must see film.  The story draws you in, along with the strong believable performances by Roth and Julia Ormond. The strong chemistry between those two is electric you can literally feel the sparks.  Bittersweet and touching, but alsosuspenseful.  Be sure to check out this drama.</p>
