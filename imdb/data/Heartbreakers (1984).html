<h1>Heartbreakers (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Blue and Eli, two friends, have problems with women. Blue, a yet-to-be discovered painter is left by his longtime girlfriend, because she considers him too immature for a longlsting relationship. Eli on the other hand, who works in his father's aerobic suit business, is still searching for a woman who is interesting enough to spend more than one night with her. Their friendship is put to a severe test as both fall in love with Liliane, Blue's attractive new gallerist.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stylishly directed, very well-acted, offbeat, adult film with good, complex characterizations and a terrific music score that pushes it forward. The only problems are a certain lack of direction (in the sense of destination and purpose), and some implausible scenes (the behavior of the French woman is rather totally unrealistic). Still, the film is never boring and deserved better than it got from the public.    (***)</p>
