<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mary Beth is a marine biologist that gets annoyed when a dog called Zeus stows aboard her research boat. Nevertheless she is intrigued when the intrusive canine makes best-friends with her captive dolphin, Roxanne. She falls in love with Zeus's owner, Terry, a musician who rides a bike.</p>
<p>This is a movie about a marine biologist, Mary Beth, who is a single parent and leads a hectic life with her two impossible daughters, Judith and Nora. She, along with her partner Becky, are trying to study and save a beautiful dolphin named Roxanne. Unfortunately, Mary Beth's greedy partner, Claude Carver, tries to capture the dolphin and sell her. Zeus, Terry, and Jordan's dog stow away one day on one of Mary Beth's boat trips, which really annoys Mary Beth. However, when she finds out that the dog and the dolphin can do "interspecies communication," she is intrigued and curious. She meets Terry, the single father of Jordan, and they go out. In the end, it's a race to save the dolphin and Zeus, who was kidnapped by Claude.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this on a bus returning from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Unfortunately, by the time the guide got it going we only saw about 45 minutes of it before we got back to Orlando. I had enjoyed it immensely and wanted to see how it turned out. Fortunately over 12 months later Sky got around to showing it and I was delighted that it was as sweet as I remembered. I'm usually a bit of a cynic with "family" movies, but, this had such a nice feel about it and on a miserable British winter day it was a great tonic. I had often wondered what had happened to Steve Guttenburg and he turned in a nice performance as did Kathleen Quinlan. The kids were good too, not sickly sweet and nauseating as some movie kids are. As for the comment about the kid with the Goth look, you have no clue about teenagers, she came across as a typical one. The animals were good too and all in all it was a nice easy to watch movie and I'd rather watch it 10 times than have to sit through "Big Momma's House 2" and it's ilk just the once. 7 out of 10.</p>
