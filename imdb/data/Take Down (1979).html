<h1>Take Down (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ed Branish, a snooty English teacher who finds his situation at Mingo Junction High School far beneath him and barely tolerable, flaunts his air of superiority over all (including his supportive wife) by frequently spouting platitudes from literary masters to validate his often contemptuous viewpoint. His habit of having as little to do with his school as possible finally gets the better of him when his light schedule makes him the only staff member available to supervise the newly formed wrestling team. Cornered, he lashes out at the first student to cross his path - Nick Kilvitus, a reserved 185 lbs. senior who's embarrassed by his near-poverty social status and who's also missed a lot of classes lately. No one realizes Nick's been filling in for his alcoholic father at a steel mill (hauling I-beams) when his dad's too drunk to show up (which is all too often, and which also keeps Nick busy at night fishing his embittered father out of bars - to be carried home (Fireman's Carry style) across town because they don't have a working car). Nick hopes he can make up the missed school work in Ed's class to graduate in Spring but instead gets a tongue-lashing on how he should be held back as an example of the consequences of laziness and irresponsibility. Fortunately, because of the wrestling team, both will cross paths again and discover they each have much more to them than what they were previously aware.</p>
<p>An unqualified teacher finds himself saddled with coaching duties after a small group of high school seniors form a wrestling team in a last ditch effort to end a 9-year losing streak against a rival school.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vincent Roberts shines as Bobby Cooper, Maureen McCormick's brother.  He shows a sense of shyness, sensitivity, and vulnarability when he finds out that he is sick.  He decides to quit the wrestling team just before they must wrestle their arch-rivals Rockville.  He makes a touching speech to Nick (Lorenzo Lamas) when Nick gives up on the team.  Bobby would give anything to go back and he can't.  It is a touching and somewhat sad tribute to this actor whose career was cut short.  His death at the age of 21 has saddened me very much.</p>
