<h1>The Icicle Thief (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The director Maurizio Nichetti is invited by a TV studio to introduce a screening of his best-known film, the neo-realist classic 'Ladri di saponette'. But Nichetti is horrified to discover that his black-and-white tale of life in poverty is constantly interrupted by garish colour commercials, and even more horrified when a power cut in the studio causes film and commercials to be mixed up -a glamorous model finds herself in the arms of an unemployed pauper, while his wife finds herself in consumer heaven. So Nichetti has to break into the film to try to sort everything out</p>
<p>A movie resembling Bicycle Thieves (1948) is shown on TV, but the real-life world gets muddled with the film and the TV commercials.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Maurizio Nichetti is a guest on a TV show. He shows his film which is reminiscent of the neo-realist Italian classic 'The Bicycle Thief' except the man steals a chandelier for his wife. The film is shown along with the commercials. Nichetti is angry that his dialog is cut up by the commercial break and the commercials start effecting the movie. After a power outage, the film and commercials get completely mixed up and Nichetti goes into the screen to tries to fix it.The black and white movie isn't terribly interesting other than for cinephiles. It gets more and more wacky as the people from the commercials interact with the movie characters. It turns into a little crazy surrealist fun.</p>
