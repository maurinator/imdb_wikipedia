<h1>Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Another spoof from the mind of Mel Brooks. This time he's out to poke fun at the Dracula myth. Basically, he took "Bram Stoker's Dracula," gave it a new cast and a new script and made a big joke out of it. The usual, rich English are attacked by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day.</p>
<p>Mel Brooks' parody of the classic vampire story and its famous film adaptations.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film is not vintage Mel Brooks and it has some obvious flaws, but it is nonetheless a true joy to watch and is sure to make you smile.  My main problem was that it did not meet my initial expectations.  Young Frankenstein is CLASSIC Mel Brooks.  It is a flawless film parody of the Frankenstein myth.  I went into seeing Dracula:  Dead and Loving It with extremely high expectations and was a bit disappointed.  The film, however, is a good film and a good parody of the Bram Stoker classic  It is not as good as Love at First Bite, but has many excellent moments.  Some of the highlights are Leslie Nielson, with whom the torch of modern comedy rests safely for being absurd yet sublime in his characterization, his superb imitation of Bela Lugosi's mannerisms and speech enhance his comedy. The film also is surprisingly faithful; to the novel and has many inside jokes.  Harvey Korman, Peter MacNicol, and Mel Brooks all lend a hand in the lunacy.  The setting is surreal and gives the picture a Hammeresgue quality. A must see for horror fans who  like a good belly laugh!</p>
