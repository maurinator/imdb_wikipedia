<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was made by Ruy Guerra, one of the pillars of the "Cinema Novo" - a movement in Brazilian Cinema that changed radically the esthetics of Brazilian films. Its major directors were, among many others, Glauber Rocha, Ruy Guerra, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Luis Sergio Person, to name only a few.The "Cinema Novo" was influenced by the Italian neorealism and the french "Nouvelle Vague" but achieved its own identity. During the 60s such classics as "Terra em Transe" by Glauber Rocha, "Vidas Secas" by Nelson Pereira dos Santos, "SÃ£o Paulo" S.A." by Luis Sergio Person etc.. came into being."Os Deuses e os Mortos" was released in 1970 when a second and still more radical movement was sweeping the Brazilian cinema, known as "Udigrudi" (brazilian joking translation for underground) that subverted radically the narrative structure of the traditional film. "Os Deuses e os Mortos" was born in this context.The first films made by Ruy Guerra can be considered examples of the classic "Cinema Novo": "Os Cafajestes" (1962) deeply influenced by the "Nouvelle Vague" but nonetheless revealing a strong personality and "Os Fuzis"(1964) where Ruy Guerra drank from the neorealist source and also one of the mainstays of the "Cinema Novo".Now "Os Deuses e os Mortos" (1970) with its luscious colors and its surrealist narrative is what we could call a psychedelic film. I don't remember many things of the film. I know that I was deeply impressed and tried to see it again. It describes (as far as I remember) the fights of the landowners in Bahia during the 30s. I recall fights, many fruits, banquets, faces painted in white (am I mistaken?) and colors, many colors. I was completely taken by surprise!And this film is almost forgotten! No VHS or DVD copies on the market. No one mentions it. "Make a grave for the unknown soldier" sings Jim Morrison, and I say "release a DVD of the forgotten film". I mean of course "Os Deuses e os Mortos".</p>
