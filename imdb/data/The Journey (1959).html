<h1>The Journey (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Budapest 1956. A group of Westerners try to leave the city when Soviet military occupy the country. But the airport is closed down and they have to take a bus to the border. At the border they are stopped by red tape - and Major Surov. The reasons are sketchy, but it seems that the major is romantically interested in one of the westerners, Diana Ashmore.</p>
<p>1956. The Soviets have appropriated Budapest Airport, in the process stranding many travelers trying to get in or out of what is now war torn Hungary. After several days, Aeroflot has decided to bus some of those trying to leave Budapest 250km to safety in Vienna, where they will make alternate travel arrangements to wherever their ultimate destination. In a busload of sixteen - fourteen adults and two children - of various nationalities, most of the passengers are most concerned about Henry Fleming, an Austrian born British national who seems to be ill with what is assumed to be the flu, which may further delay their travels. Of the other passengers, soon to be divorced Lady Diana Ashmore, another British national, has taken it upon herself to be Fleming's caregiver as the two had traveled together out of coincidence on the latest leg of their travels to get them to Budapest Airport. In reality, Fleming is Paul Kedes, a Hungarian national, trying to get out of the country, his "illness" an untreated gunshot wound to the right shoulder. He was imprisoned by the Soviets in 1952 for fighting for the Hungarians as he considered his national duty, a measure the Soviets charge to be counter-revolutionary, and had just been released. He and Diana have known each other for five years, she having run into him in Budapest by accident. The two have long been in love and are planning to get married, with Diana now willing to do anything, including kill, to get him to safety outside of Hungary. They almost make it across the Hungary-Austria border, when the bus is detained 2km inside the Hungarian side of the border by Soviet Major Surov, who uses the pretense of needing to reissue travel documents to the sixteen to keep them in Hungary for what is an unspecified period of time. The longer the hold up, the more precarious the situation for Paul and Diana as the reality of their situation may be discovered. If Surov or the Soviets find out, they could execute them. If the other passengers find out, they will have to decide what to do with the information, as they too could be charged with aiding and abetting who would be considered a fugitive. Beyond his professional duties, Surov may have ulterior motives for detaining the sixteen, or in reality wanting to detain only one, he as a man whose neighbors in this town have changed their opinion of him overnight solely because he is a Soviet.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, a group of international travelers are stranded at Budapest airport. They are told they will have to take a bus to Vienna, several hundred kilometers away. The trip is uneventful but on the Hungarian side of the border they are stopped by the Soviets and forced to stay in a hotel until their clearance to leave the country is received. Soviet Major Sorov is genial and treats them well, but rightly suspects that they may not all be foreigners. He takes a particular interest in a British traveler, Diana Ahmore, and the others begin to feel they are being kept there because of her. Throughout, Hungarian resistance fighters mount a futile campaign of resistance against their new oppressors.</p>
<p>A British woman trying to escape Hungary with her freedom fighter lover finds herself the obsession of a Communist officer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story). Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character.Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view, but she is a superb actress. She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey, Quo Vadis, and The Night of Iguana memorable.Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era.The film is also unusual in its casting--great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international than American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment.Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film, while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g. the last bus ride and the final kiss)But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (e.g., Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.</p>
