<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sam Whiskey is an all-round talent, but when the attractive widow Laura offers him a job, he hesitates: he shall salvage gold bars, which Laura's dead husband stole recently, from a sunken ship and secretly bring them back to the mint before they are missed. But how shall he manage to get several hundred pounds of gold into the mint without anyone noticing?</p>
<p>At the end of the Civil War, Sam Whiskey (Burt Reynolds) is seduced away from his career as a gambler by the lovely Laura Breckenridge (Angie Dickinson). She wants him to help her recover a quarter of a million dollars worth of gold bars which her late husband stole. The gold is aboard a sunken river boat in the River Platte in Colorado and must be recovered and restored to Denver Mint before the theft is discovered - which could destroy Laura's family name. Sam agrees to do the job for $20,000 and teams up with a local blacksmith and a buddy from the war. The team heads for the Platte, unaware that they are being followed by an outlaw who wants the gold for himself. Using a home-made diving helmet that will allow Sam to go beneath the river; but after the heroes retrieve the loot, the outlaw steals it from them. With some interesting weaponry, Sam manages to recover the gold and with his cohort rejoins Laura in Denver where he poses as a government inspector, enters the mint, and "accidentally" damages a bust of George Washington. He insists upon having it repaired and takes it back to his blacksmith friend, where the gold is recast into the shape of the bronze bust. When outlaw Rick Davis catches up with the trio, he mistakenly steals the original bust. Sam and company gain entrance to the mint and there recast the bust back into gold bars. The next morning Laura rewards the men with the promised $20,000 and Sam with her heart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's no mystery that Burt Reynolds is one of the most underestimated actors of our time. In this particular film, he gave us one of his best comedy-stilish acting ("no-one noticed it", he said) which makes this movie working. Burt's acting would be enough to make it watchable, but also Ossie Davis and Clint Walker fit well in their roles.For me the remarkable of this movie is a) the way it is directed and edited (it ain't dull for one second), although there are some silly situations (e.g. Burt firing with a machine gun to save his friends killing all his enemies without hitting his friends...), but hey, it's a comedy and it's not the story which is most interesting. It's the mood of the film and the way characters are portrayed. It contains a lot of fine jokes and dialogue ("I'm not riding this long way to bury your bird") and chemistry between Burt and Angie Dickinson is amazing. Also the more serious parts of the film (stealing the gold out of the fort) are working well.Also, there are some things which seem to be rare in a film: The fact that no-one of the "thieves" have intentions killing his buddies to keep the gold for himself. No, they even break in to return it back to the government! It's hardly believable, but it is that fact that make the film and these characters charming.I give it a 7 of 10</p>
