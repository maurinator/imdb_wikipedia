<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well done soap-opera theatrics where injured soldier, Jeff Chandler, falls for nurse Loretta Young and the two soon wed and have a lovely daughter. Sounds typical with a poor girl marrying a rich, handsome businessman like Jeff.The big secret is that Loretta was in jail as no one believed her innocence in the participation of a robbery.She never told Jeff about her former life. Years later, the guy who led her down this path, suddenly shows up one afternoon and kidnaps her with the child. After another robbery, there is a high speed chase and the guy is killed instantly. Loretta and daughter survive the wreck physically-but there are plenty of emotional problems as a result.An enraged Jeff accuses Ms. Young of being a tramp and immediately files for divorce and gains full custody of the child.Loretta takes a job as an entertainer for children's parties. Her sister-in-law comes has her come over. Since this is years later, the child does not know that Loretta is her mother. The kid has hangups. (Who wouldn't after all this?) Unexpectedly, Jeff comes home and there are fireworks.While we see many clichés here, the film is nicely done with Chandler showing that he was a good actor. His emotional outbursts are believable. Young is subdued but as always turns in a competent performance.The film was originally supposed to be called "Magic Lady," but there is no magic here. Just a tale of tell your entire background to your mate-to-be.</p>
