<h1>Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 2020, after the colonization of the moon, the spaceships Vega, Sirius and Capella are launched from Lunar Station 7. They are to explore Venus under the command of Professor Hartman, but an asteroid collides and explodes Capella. The leader ship Vega stays orbiting and sends the astronauts Kern and Sherman with the robot John to the surface of Venus, but they have problems with communication with Dr. Marsha Evans in Vega. The Sirius lands in Venus and Commander Brendan Lockhart, Andre Ferneau and Hans Walter explore the planet and are attacked by prehistoric animals. They use a vehicle to seek Kern and Sherman while collecting samples from the planet. Meanwhile John helps the two cosmonauts to survive in the hostile land.</p>
<p>In the year 2020, cosmonaut Marcia (Faith Domergue) orbits the planet Venus while five astronauts and a robot journey on the surface. Professor Hartman (Basil Rathbone) is also on hand to observe the exploration from a distance. The explorers are attacked by prehistoric beasts, and then lose their robot (and nearly their lives!) in a volcanic eruption. They discover signs of a lost civilization and an artifact indicating that the Venusians had looked human. But what of the strange singing sound they often have heard during their exploration? Do the anthropomorphic Venusians still exist?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>According to the trivia behind this movie, it was a Russian production re-dubbed for western audiences. It's a fun and pulpy romp to Venus, loaded with action, bizarre dialog and some even more strange humor. The costumes are cool and the robot is absolutely AMAZING. When they made Starship Troopers not too long ago, they should have kept the powered armor and patterned it after the robot. Instead they went for the big army look, full of extras and other silliness rather than Heinlein's original vision. Come to think of it, the other special effects in the movie are really good too. The little land speeder one of the teams cruises around in looks like it inspired George Lucas. I love watching this movie with my son, give it a shot!</p>
