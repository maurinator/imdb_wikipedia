<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a minor entry in Bunuel's Mexican period. It's a farce of sorts, that starts as a melodrama and ends up like a screwball comedy. There are some little Bunuel touches here and there, especially in the first half of the picture, but all in all this can't account among Don Luis' most personal films. Technically it is as usual superb. There's one elegant 20 year transition that takes place in the dark between the closing and opening of a cupboard and a puzzling breaking of the fourth wall at the end, when Don Quintin approaches the camera and talks to the audience before going back to the happy ending. I liked the idea of a cabaret called El Infierno decorated with flames and big puppet devils hanging from the roof. Only a man like Bunuel could come with such stuff.</p>
