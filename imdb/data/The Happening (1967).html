<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A rude awakening awaits a Miami gangster played by Anthony Quinn, as he is kidnapped, and then betrayed one by one by all the people he thought he could count on in life.Quinn does a beautiful job of playing someone who suddenly realizes just where he stands in the world, and who he real friends are.I guess this movie could be called a "dark comedy" in some regards, it nevertheless leaves you feeling good at the end as you see how masterfully Quinn's reassembles the pieces of his shattered world.</p>
