<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an excellent film with an outstanding cast, and a very authentic feel to the overall presentation.  Will Rogers, Jr. becomes Will Rogers, Sr. This is a good story about an outstanding "American" personality, and it should definitely be made available on video for all "Americans" to see, especially during these trying times when patriotism, honesty and goodwill could use a shot-in-the-arm. Hopefully it will be make the step to video in the very near future.</p>
