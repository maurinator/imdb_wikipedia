<h1>Foul Play (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When, unbeknownst to Gloria, a microfilm cassette is left with her by a dying agent, she becomes entangled in a complicated series of events. She's pursued by a dwarf and an albino, and becomes convinced that they are out to kill her. Finally, with the help of San Francisco detective Tony Carlson, she begins to turn the tables on her pursuers. It becomes clear that the nerfarious crew after her are plotting a dastardly deed indeed - to assassinate the Pope as he visits the city to see _The Mikado_. Gloria and Tony must race against time to prevent this terrible crime.</p>
<p>Ever since coming out of a failed marriage, San Francisco librarian Gloria Mundy has lived a reclusive life with no romance on the horizon. Encouraged by her friends who think she should start dating again, Gloria picks up a stranded motorist along the highway, he named Bob 'Scotty' Scott. The two make a date for later that evening. At that date in a dark movie theater, Scotty, with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, tells Gloria among other things that there's going to be a murder and to "beware of the dwarf", after which he dies. But before she can call in the authorities, Scotty's dead body goes missing with no one in the theater having seen him either dead or alive. As Gloria nervously wonders what is happening, a series of people including a dwarf, an albino, a Turkish looking man, and a man with a scar on his face, are chasing her seemingly wanting to kill her. All the while, she keeps on encountering this nervous little English-accented man who wants Gloria for another reason. The police are finally called in after a break-in at her apartment, where she thinks she's killed the man with the scar on his face. When SFPD Detectives Tony Carlson and 'Fergie' Ferguson arrive on the scene, they find Gloria unconscious with no dead body in sight. Despite both detectives thinking that her ramblings are pure hallucinations, Tony, attracted to her, decides to be Gloria's protector. But as more and more happens to Gloria, the mystery behind Scotty and his death becomes clearer. Scotty's death is only one element in a plot more vast than either Gloria, Tony or Fergie could have imagined.</p>
<p>A shy San Francisco librarian and a bumbling cop fall in love as they solve a crime involving albinos, dwarves, and the Catholic Church.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perky librarian Gloria Mundy (Hawn) has stumbled on to a plot to assassinate the pope. Now she has an albino, a dwarf and a scarfaced killer "after her ass."  She turns to Det. Tony Carlson (Chase) and together they crack the case. The plot, including the obligatory car chase through the streets of San Francisco, is totally by the numbers, but this movie has a lot of minor delights. Witty dialog and a brilliant supporting cast help a lot. As for the leads, Hawn was in her prime. Even in the bad seventies makeup, hairdos and clothes she is adorable. Chevy Chase doesn't have a lot to do, as the script gives most of the heroic moments to Hawn. Even so, he turns out to be quite a charmer.  I'd forgotten that, back when he was young and handsome, his bumbling schtick actually worked. The best part of seeing Foul Play now is spotting the multitude of 70's anachronisms.  Just a few that stand out: Gloria thinks nothing of picking up a hitchhiker. She's a non-smoker but lets someone light up in her car.  Chevy Chase's character, a police detective, smokes a joint now and then.  Ah, those were the days. If this movie appeals to you, I would strongly suggest "Silver Streak" (1976), another comedy/romance/thriller also written by Colin Higgins. These two films share a similar sensibility, and I'd love to see them at a revival house as a double feature.</p>
