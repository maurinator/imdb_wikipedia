<h1>Warlock (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Boston of 1691, a warlock is sentenced to death, but escapes magically into the future (our present), followed doggedly by the witch hunter. There he is searching for the three parts of the Devil's Bible, trailed by the witch hunter and the woman whose house he landed in. They must stop him, as the book contains the true name of God, which he can use to un-create the world.</p>
<p>A warlock flees from the 17th to the 20th century, with a witch-hunter in hot pursuit.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie actually is a pretty fun film with a lot more going for it than most people might think just looking at the cover.  Sands is perfectly cast as the warlock, an evil-to-the-core witch who works for nothing less than the uncreation of the cosmos.  Fighting him is an out-of-his-element witch-hunter who has chased him to the present (Grant) with a peculiar confidence.  He knows his enemy and knows what he needs to do to prevent the warlock from completing the Grand Grimoire, but is lost in the present. Tagging along is a modern-day girl who is acceptably portrayed by Lori Singer caught between the warlock's unbelievable powers, her newfound friend from the past with an obsession, and her now blasted view of "how things work in the real world."  Two things really make this film though.  The first is that the explanations that are given actually don't bog the momentum down (and the filmmakers decide to leave some things unexplained or give the most cursory explanations to catch the audience up in the wild ride that Kassandra (Singer) has found herself in) and that although both the warlock and the hunter have powers, they are closly matched and totally obsessed, making for a very interesting conflict.  There's also enough tongue in cheek to keep people interesting and to break occasional tension.  Very watchable - go and try it on for size.</p>
