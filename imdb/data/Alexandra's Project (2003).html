<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Steve is a man who has it all, a successful career, wonderful children, beautiful home and a loving wife. However, returning to his home after work on his birthday, he finds his house deserted and darkened with almost all the lightbulbs missing, all easy access outside cut off and a videotape waiting for him. Playing that tape, he watches a bizarre and grueling recording in which his wife explains her grievance with him, her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how he treated her in a way he would never forget.</p>
<p>A regular suburban family man comes home from work on his birthday to find a deserted house and a videotape waiting to be played...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie starts pretty powerful and suspenseful. But the problem is the twist in the story. And while others do talk about it here, I'm not going the spoiler road. But I will tell you, that everything falls apart with that twist. The main problem being that the viewers feelings have to change (for the characters). But it does not go the full way, so most actions seem ridiculous.Of course you could argue, that some of the things have been done in other movies, without any reasons (none that we are told or as slim as those portrayed here ... slim for the mayhem it seems to have kicked off). But we're not talking about other movies, we are talking about this one. The way the movie starts leaves a few things open. But the way it decides to go, is a path with no redemption. Still nicely done, but not my cup of tea.</p>
