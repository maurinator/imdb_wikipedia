<h1>Hell's Half Acre (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A woman who believes her missing husband is in prison in Hawaii on a murder charge travels there to see if it actually is him. However, he escapes before she sees him, when he hears that his current girlfriend has been murdered. The wife searches the slum area of Honolulu known as Hell's Half Acre for him, he searches for his girlfriend's killer, and his gangland associates are looking for the two of them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This flat-footed, full-of-holes feature is nonetheless fascinating because of its Honolulu locale and exotic characters.  Marie Windsor as Jesse White's wife and Philip Ahn's mistress?  Film noir nirvana!  And the Production Code vision of a hellish den of iniquity?  A crisply clean framework of lumber and whitewash enclosing gambling parlors and taxi-dancehalls!</p>
