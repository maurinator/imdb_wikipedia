<h1>Go for Broke! (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A tribute to the U.S. 442nd Regimental Combat Team, formed in 1943 by Presidential permission with Japanese-American volunteers. We follow the training of a platoon under the rueful command of Lt. Mike Grayson who shares common prejudices of the time. The 442nd serve in Italy, then France, distinguishing themselves in skirmishes and battles; gradually and naturally, Grayson's prejudices evaporate with dawning realization that his men are better soldiers than he is. Not preachy.</p>
<p>The most decorated unit in US military history, and made up of Japanese-American volunteers, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team fights heroically despite widespread prejudice from fellow soldiers. The 442 battles the Nazis while slogging through Italy, and suffering humiliation from their scornful commander, Lt. Grayson (Van Johnson), who eventually comes to see his men in a much more complimentary way. The film features many actual surviving WW II veterans of the 442nd Regiment.</p>
<p>The story of Japanese-American soldiers who fought in Europe during World War II.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This little-known film is an interesting dramatic study of real life Japanese-Americans who volunteered to fight for their country despite the interment of their families back in the 'States. Their amazing heroism and patriotism is shown in contrast to the rascism and general mistrust they are shown by white members of the US army that they encounter. Racial issues such as their treatment compared to German-Americans or Italian-Americans are dealt with, but not in a heavy handed way. The dialogue is surprisingly believable and interesting, and even amusing. The battle sequences are good but nothing like Saving Private Ryan - this is a 1950s film, after all. All WWII film buffs should make a point of seeing this film, which sometimes appears on the History Channel.</p>
