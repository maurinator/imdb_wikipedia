<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That quote from Milk Money above truly applies to this poor excuse for a movie; better to call it a flick, "movie" is too good for it.Paramount supposedly paid over $1 million for the script (there's a sucker born every minute).There is some decent talent here, but it is wasted, really wasted.The pretext for this mess is stupid, implausible, silly.It is not worth reviewing as a watchable film; needless to say, I didn't watch it all the way through.Do not go near this flick! You will embarrass yourself, like these actors embarrassed themselves making it!</p>
