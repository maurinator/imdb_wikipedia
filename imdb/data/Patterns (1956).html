<h1>Patterns (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the fierce and corrosive competition that exists in the executive branch of Ramsey & Co., a New York industrial colossus headed by Walter Ramsey, its cold, designing and ruthless chief. It is the saga, too, of Bill Briggs, his longtime second in command, who is swayed by human as well as technological values. And, it is the case of Fred Staples, a comparatively youthful industrial engineer brought in by Ramsey to succeed Briggs. The younger man's views and sensitivities are essentially the same as Briggs'. People are not merely units, they feel. But it is Ramsey's calculated pattern not to fire his aging aide but to create such untenable positions that he will be forced to resign.</p>
<p>Fred Staples is plucked out of a conglomerate's subsidiary and put into the executive suite at the company's headquarters. He's relocated his family to New York City and at first feels out of place. He strikes a friendship with William Briggs, the Vice President to whom he nominally reports. Staples is good at his job and the company's hard-nosed president, Walter Ramsey, is pleased with his choice. Staples has a crisis of conscience when Ramsey tells him that he's been recruited to replace Briggs, someone who has devoted his entire life to the company at the expense of his family life. Briggs knows what Ramsey is up to but digs in his heels and refuses to quit. Tragedy ensues forcing Staples to act.</p>
<p>When Fred Staples is recruited onto the board of a high-powered New York corporation, he finds his ethics and ambition at odds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This tight, intense little film has been rarely seen in recent years (although the original teleplay on which it is based was a huge hit.)  It's impact has been dulled slightly (mostly because it's ideas have been stolen for other countless TV shows and movies), but it's basic story is still as relevant as ever.  Heflin is a small town plant manager whose company has been swallowed up by Sloane's conglomerate.  Sloane moves him up to the executive level of the conglomerate and sets him up with a beautiful home, a fancy office and a top secretary.  Soon, however, Heflin realizes that his promotion may have more to do with leverage against one of Sloane's adversaries, his vice president, Begley.  Straight is Heflin's materialistic wife who urges him to succeed no matter what the moral cost.  Wilson is Begley's secretary who finds herself torn between personal loyalty and company loyalty.  The film is a curt 83 minutes and wisely unpadded with excess subplots.  The acting is uniformly strong.  Heflin is able to display a wide range of emotion.  Begley, often cast as overbearing boors, is able to show a more vulnerable side.  Sloane is the one who almost goes over the top.  He shouts wildly at the drop of a hat and doesn't allow anyone to finish a sentence.  One hopes that his type of management wouldn't be tolerated in today's world, but it very well may be.  Wilson comes across very solidly in one of her better screen roles.  She's given many quiet moments that display her internal struggle.  (She would later put a comedic spin on the whole office thing with her wondrous turn in "9 to 5".)  Straight is good, but isn't really a focal point of the story.  The film has a dim view of corporate America and the unsettling feelings in the office begin right away.  Though the times have changed, this story still holds value today and is an arresting work to watch.</p>
