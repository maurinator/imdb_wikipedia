<h1>Mad About Men (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gymnastics school teacher Caroline Trewella inherits a house on the Cornwall coast. In the basement/smuggler's cave, she discovers mermaid Miranda. The young women share a common ancestor and are remarkably alike in looks. While Caroline is away on a bicycling tour, Miranda has fun taking her place on land. With the help of her friend Nurse Carey, Miranda feigns an injury that keeps her wheelchair-bound... or more often needing to be carried by a man. And the ever flirtatious Miranda certainly knows how to attract all the men of the village!</p>
<p>Flirtatious mermaid Miranda swaps places with a schoolteacher who has gone on holiday. All is well until she falls in love with a human.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Peter Blackmore scripted this weak whimsical fantasy, a Technicolor sequel to 1948's black-and-white "Miranda" (which had been based upon Blackmore's play). Glynis Johns returns as the romantic-minded mermaid who swims in the waters off Cornwall; she chances to meet her human twin, a distant relative and school-mistress who is about to be married to a stuffy engineer. Blackmore clearly relishes the chance to open up his scenario and throw in some wild bits of humor--and Johns in a dual role is certainly an inspired idea--but most of the warmth from the first film is missing. Miranda's true identity is discovered by a jealous female, who hopes to exploit the siren on-stage during a charity benefit (!), while Caroline, Miranda's twin, has to rush home from a biking trip to save the mermaid from catastrophe. Faintly enjoyable and yet too much of a good thing, what with corny one-liners and Margaret Rutherford overacting like mad in a reprisal of her role as Miranda's eccentric nurse and confidante. Blackmore and director Ralph Thomas raise a big laugh or two, but their chaotic finale is a complete muck-up, and the film's editing and continuity are disappointing. ** from ****</p>
