<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of army personnel and nurses attempt a dangerous and arduous trek across the deserts of North Africa during the second world war. The leader of the team dreams of his ice cold beer when he reaches Alexandria, but the problems just won't go away.</p>
<p>Transportation unit personnel and two nurses are compelled to try a journey across a part of the desert that is dangerous in itself and also made more perilous by enemy unit actions. The idea is to reach Alexandria, where one of the rewards might be an ice cold lager - However, the journey, carried out in an ambulance of less-than-perfect state of maintenance and with the complications of a mysterious "hitch-hiker" is really not just a drive down the block. What with natural obstacles and the complications of a war situation, it becomes a hairy undertaking where all involved are tried to their limit.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a masterly example of how to make a film.  The plot is simple, how to get an ambulance from behind enemy lines to safety, but it's given such force and power by the characters thrown together to achieve this.  The alcoholic burnt out Captain, the solid Sergeant Major, the plucky nurse and the mysterious stranger.  The performances are somewhat mannered by todays standards however they are all excellent, especially Harry Andrews (who rarely gets a mention) but who is the solid rock that holds the other characters together.  Don't miss the original UK version, the shortened US version may be safely passed over.  This film shows it is possible to make an interesting war film with hardly any violence.</p>
