<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Craggy old Klaus Kinski lives with his awkward assistant Max on a space station, developing a female android. Max spends his time playing old arcade games and researching the human condition - (I heard somewhere that the external shots of the space station were done by creating a model station from a display case which used to house watches or jewelry!) Into this scenario comes band of escaped convicts on a space ship badly damaged during their escape ...There is humour in this film but it is of a very dark shade. The LACK of special effects ADDS to the "reality" of the film.A couple of really unexpected plot twists along the way - I rate it a "9" which is the highest I have ever given a film on the IMDb</p>
