<h1>Chance (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>'Chance' is a black comedy about how hard it is to find "the one". Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: "we're all out there looking for true love", which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she get's herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is "it".</p>
<p>Chance is a single, neurotic, 20-something woman living in Los Angeles trying to get by any way she can (waitressing, acting, etc.) Her one true goal in life, as her frequent narration to the viewers, are to find her 'Mr. Right'. The people in Chance's life are Simon, her slacker roommate and telemarketer whom has a crush on her, but is too much in denial to admit it to her or even himself; Rory, a struggling actor and Chance's ex-boyfriend with massive crush on her, but he's too boring for her to be interested; Milton is her creepy voyeuristic neighborhood whom lusts after her; Jack is a struggling singer whom Chance finds attractive, but unaware that he's gay; Guy is another person in Chance's life whose romance is cut short by an accident; Sara is a young and outgoing bisexual woman from Manchester, England whom after a one-night stand with Chance, ends up dead from a drug OD, or does she? And then there's Chance's mother Desiree who's even more crazy than Chance, and distraught over her husband Malcolm divorcing her to be with his personal secretary.</p>
<p>A young woman tries to find the right man to be with while dealing with her own life and family problems.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you're a mediocre actress with nothing to do, what else is there to do but poorly write a movie? Well, you can badly direct, produce, and star in it.A furious hurricane of wankalicious self-aggrandizement, Chance utterly fails at being compelling. The only reason a viewer could possibly watch this movie is through being a pre-existing fan of Amber Benson.I had the vast misfortune of seeing this project, which completely comes across as "it'd be really awesome if this random thing happened..." amateurism.The characters don't journey anywhere, and the only real acting came from James Marsters, who plays a man as only a woman could write one: emotionally vulnerable and feminine, as opposed to Amber Benson's own character, who fills all the masculinity of the piece.The editing was horrifying, as well. There is a scene wherein Chance is relating her thoughts about a guy she was seeing. He's dull. This is well pointed out, but then the interminably boring conversation keeps going. For a very long time.In short, it's a "screwball romantic comedy" that is decent for a class project in high school. But this tripe wouldn't cut it in the professional world.</p>
