<h1>Grand Theft Auto (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As an aspiring young thug, your mission in this video game is to perform odd jobs for the mob, picking up points along the way by committing random crimes ranging from auto theft to hit-and-runs to murder. After proving your worth on the streets of Liberty City, expert hoods can move on to terrorize the streets of San Andreas and Vice City. This game is notable for its free playing style, in which players don't actually have to complete any of the missions to win the game, instead racking up points by engaging in freestyle mayhem.</p>
<p>As a young street hustler you explore the free world of Liberty city while doing jobs and assigments.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember I once played this game for 5 hours straight and I still could not get past the first level. But for me, most of the time, I'm having so much fun killing people and smashing up cars that I don't care about the missions.It's also most fun to defect from your current gang and just kill 'em all off. This is one game that makes it look like so much to actually run people over. It's a pity that only the Playstation version doubles as a soundtrack CD but I gotta admit that is one cool radio station. These songs are rockin'. This is rather good considering it's only a game.The graphics are kind of poor tho and the gameplay doesn't change much from level to level but who cares?!?!</p>
