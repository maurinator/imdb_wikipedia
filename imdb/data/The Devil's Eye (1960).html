<h1>The Devil's Eye (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The devil has a stye in his eye, caused by the purity of a vicar's daughter. To get rid of it, he sends Don Juan up from hell to seduce the 20 year old Britt-Marie and to rob her of her virginity and her belief in love. She however can resist him and things get even turned around when Don Juan falls in love with her. The fact that he feels love for the first time now, makes him even less attractive to her and Don Juan returns to hell.</p>
<p>An actor presents a comedy in three acts. That story involves Satan who has developed a painful sty, which is the result of something tumultuous happening on earth. He learns from his advisers that that tumultuous thing is the pure chastity of twenty year old Nordic beauty Britt-Marie, the daughter of a vicar, she who is soon to be married to her longtime beau, Jonas. To get rid of his sty, Satan knows he has to get someone to defile Britt-Marie before her marriage, or else her purity could cause a ripple effect which would be disastrous for him beyond the sty. Satan pulls out the big guns in the form of Don Juan, who has been in hell for three hundred years and who Satan has punished with continually performing the act of seduction on women but never being able to complete the seduction to the actual act of love. Beyond Satan reducing his punishment, Don Juan agrees only if his longtime servant Pablo can also be sent to earth with him on this assignment. While Pablo can't help but try to indulge in some of earth's forbidden pleasures, Don Juan may find a slightly different soul in Britt-Marie than he anticipates and thus a slightly different challenge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a comedy in a more Shakespearean way than what an American would see as comedy. This drama/play begins in Hell where Satan is upset because he has a sty in his eye. It seems that if one were to get a virgin to allow herself to be despoiled before marriage, the eye would be cured. So the Devil sends the great lover, Don Juan, to perform just the task. He has been in Hell for over 300 years and embraces the challenge. He takes with him his Sancho Panza like character, and they invite themselves into the home of a vicar who has the lovely daughter and a hypochondriac wife who is hiding from the world. While Don Juan goes after the daughter, Pablo, the other guy goes after the wife. He has also been getting ready for as long as his master. They are accompanied by a demon who is sort of their chaperon since Pablo has been told not to mess around. What is interesting is that Don Juan is able to start making inroads immediately into the young woman who is ready to marry in a few days. What happens is a kind of commentary on faithfulness, adventure, religion, and any number of subjects. What is also interesting is how this invasion shows the cracks in the foundation and invites the characters to figure out how to deal with them. There are also a few slams made against the idea of heaven and hell and God and Satan. This is a really interesting film and probably good because Bergman can't turn off his talent.</p>
