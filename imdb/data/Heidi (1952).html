<h1>Heidi (1952)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I haven't seen this movie since I was a child but even then I preferred it over the Shirley Temple film.The version I saw was dubbed into English. Normally that irritated me (and still does, the rare times I see a dubbed movie--nowadays they're more often subtitled) but it actually made it easier to get into the movie because I didn't have to read any subtitles (and I don't know German). I read well above my grade level but it still would have been distracting. Now I probably wouldn't mind.This movie is much more faithful to the book than the 1937 version.Probably because it was filmed in Switzerland, where the story takes place, it has beautiful scenery. They didn't have use any back projections and sound stages for the outdoor sequences, something I noticed even as a child.I looked forward to each time it came on TV in the Los Angeles area, where I grew up. I don't why they stopped showing it unless it was because the Shirley Temple version, which began to be shown a lot at that time, simply displaced it. If so, it's a shame. I'd love to see it again (and again and again, just like back then).I was always fascinated with the story because my great-grandmother was from Switzerland and was a child at the time the book was originally published.</p>
