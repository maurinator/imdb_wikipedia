<p>From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a mammal metropolis where various animals live and thrive. When Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law. Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder.I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The World Without Any Exaggeration.Since This Movie is The Production Of Disney,it has to be perfect.</p>
