With about 22 assassins from all over the globe on his tail, Clouseau decides to find Dreyfus alone and put him back in the mental asylum.</p>

He then decides to recruit some of the best criminals in the world, and then kidnaps a noted English scientist and creates a device that can destroy the world.

Dreyfus threatens to use it unless Clouseau is exterminated, so reluctantly, 26 countries send their top assassin to kill the Chief Inspector. His clumsiness saves him again, and the assassin's attempts kill each other. In a conquest to save the world, Clouseau heads out to put an end to Dreyfus's terror once and for all.</p>
<p>Charles Dreyfus, who has finally cracked over inspector Clouseau's antics, escapes from a mental institution and launches an elaborate plan to get rid of Clouseau once and for all.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Inspector Clouseau...Commissioner Dreyfuss...Gerald Ford.  What don't you have in this movie?Funny film to watch again and again.  The chemistry is perfect between Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom.  There are so many jokes and laughs throughout, I usually pick up something new after each viewing, especially Clouseau's accent.  The castle scene with the dentist visit has got to be one of the funniest moments recorded on film.  You'd swear there really was nitrous oxide in the room.  I always get a chuckle from the apartment scene in the start.  I'd never knew how funny the use of slow motion could be.  Timing of the jokes are crazier than a set of "parallels".  Add Mancini's music which seems to fit each scene quite nicely, thank you.Probably my favorite of the Pink Panther movies (next to A Shot in the Dark), you have to love Peter Seller's portrayal of the "hit and miss" wonder named Clouseau.  Plus, Lesley Anne Down looks great as Olga and makes me appreciate a nice fur coat.  Definitely a keeper.</p>
