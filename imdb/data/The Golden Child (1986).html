<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you.In a movie like "the Golden Child", especially.  This is a movie you'd figure would star maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone.  But Eddie really does work; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else a hero should be.Having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied perfectly by Dance), Eddie goes from California, to Nepal and back, all while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) knows that he is.It's exciting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, funny.  Eddie is the only action hero I know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about Ed McMahon.No problem with this "Child": it's a "Golden" find.Nine stars.  Viva Nepal!</p>
