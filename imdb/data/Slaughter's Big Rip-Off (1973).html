<h1>Slaughter's Big Rip-Off (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vigilante Slaughter comes under attack from Duncan, a local money launderer whose hit-man traps Slaughter in a car at a cliff, but Slaughter escapes, arms himself, and goes after Duncan's hideout.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie itself is pretty good - but only the ORIGINAL version with the awesome soundtrack by James Brown. For the dvd release, the studio was too cheap to buy the rights to original music, so they replaced it with new, generic sounding funk music! And they didn't even change the credits or the packaging to reflect that!  That's a pretty big slap in the face to the father of funk himself, so that's why I say avoid this DVD at all costs.</p>
