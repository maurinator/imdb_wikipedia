<p>Biopic of Frank Sinatra and several of his cronies - dubbed the Rat Pack - during 1960-61. It was the beginning of change in America. Sinatra decides to support John F. Kennedy for President and sets about lining up the support of his friends. He is upset however when Joe Kennedy leans on him to use his purported mob connections to make sure his son wins first the nomination and then the election. Friend Sammy David Jr. falls in love with May Britt but again, pressure is put on Frank not to participate in the wedding as it may alienate southern voters. While Frank is asked to organize the inaugural ball, he again has to exclude Sammy for the same reason. The final blow is when the newly elected President visits Los Angeles and decides to stay with Bing Crosby - a Republican - rather that at his house.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The story is good and certainly made me think about maybe why and by whom John and Bobby Kennedy as well as Marilyn Monroe were killed! But that's a side point. Not a bad film but the casting director needs to be shot! Don Cheadle, as Sammy Davis is probably the most convincing and I am sure it was no easy task to capture the highly talented Mr Davis Jr, especially the dancing. The racism and the obvious pain of Sammy really came through. Angus MacFadyen's Lawford is not too bad and is second to Don Cheadle's performance. From there the casting goes really off....Joe Mantegna captures something of Dean Martin's character but is not as handsome or charming enough. William L. Petersen, looks and sounds nothing like JFK and portrays him as a shallow, weak character.Then we come to the worst casting in the whole film. Ray Liotta looks not even close to Sinatra, he is much too tall, and even worse he fails to carry himself like him and his speaking voice is just awful, he sounds like a squeaky teenager most of the time. this would not be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that he is the main character in this film and at times you even forget that he is supposed to be Sinatra.So with a better cast this could have been a superb film but it is not.</p>
