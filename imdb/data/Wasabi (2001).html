<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is the best french language movie I have seen in a while. although the language, when watching in french without subtitles, is sometimes too fast to distinguish, the overall quality of the film loses none of its charm. It is an excellent portrayal of a man coming to grips with the fact that he does, in fact, have a family. There is, however, a generous amount of comedy along the way, and quite a bit of action, violence of a comedic nature more often then not. (Mall scene, golf ball scene...) Interesting Fact: the actress who played Reno's (Hubert's) daughter actually speaks no french. she learned her lines as sounds, the words have no meaning to her.</p>
