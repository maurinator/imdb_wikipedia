<h1>Bad Company (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of naive boys find that life as desperadoes in the west is more serious that they understood when they embark on abortive careers in bushwhacking. Violence, betrayal, sombre colours and a Beckettsian whimsy mark this ironic western.</p>
<p>A god-fearing Ohio boy dodging the Civil War draft arrives in Jefferson City where he joins up with a hardscrabble group of like runaways heading west.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of the most perfect Westerns I have ever seen.All the situations are realistic.The actors are well-cast and nobody turns in a bad performance.Harvey Schmidt's piano score is the perfect complement to Gordon Willis' photography.Perennial bad-guy Geoffrey Lewis has one the funniest and most realistic dying words that have ever been put on screen.I can't find anything bad to say about this film.If you're a fan of Westerns,coming-of-age films,slice-of-life movies or buddy flicks this sleeper should not be missed.It has elements of all these different genres all wrapped up in one beautifully made movie.</p>
