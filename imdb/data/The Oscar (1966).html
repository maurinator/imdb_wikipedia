<h1>The Oscar (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frankie Fane has clawed his way to the top of the Hollywood heap. Now, as he's preparing to win his Oscar, his friend Hymie Kelly reminisces over their life together, and Frankie's ruthless struggle to the top and the people he's stepped on (i.e., everyone else in the movie) to make it there.</p>
<p>It's Oscar night. Frank Fane, who is in the audience, has been nominated for his first ever Oscar for Best Actor. Hymie Kelly, perhaps Frankie's oldest friend and confidante and who is also in the audience, recounts Frankie's rise from their humble and what may be seen as unsavory beginnings to this night. Frankie fell into acting by accident, but his foray into it was based on some talent, especially in roles most closely mirroring his own cutthroat personality and streetwise background, upon which he could draw. As his fame increased, he believed there was no way that trajectory could change course, and even if there was a hint at that happening, that he would do whatever required to get out of that hole. With this belief, he overextended his finances to live the life of luxury. As such, he ended up using people - many who in turn used him - for short term gain. He was also vindictive and ruined people solely because they at one time didn't help or screwed him. The one person he seemed to exclude from this behavior was aspiring costume designer Kay Bergdahl, who he professed to love, but who didn't give him the time of day unlike most of his adoring fans. Frankie also manipulated situations to his benefit, no matter who was hurt along the way, including his so-called friends. Hymie also explains the unlikeliness of the nomination and why it is so important in Frankie's mind for him to win.</p>
<p>Snotty Hollywood actor becomes even more full of himself after he's nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I also love this movie. I first saw it about 12-15 years ago on a short-lived series on TNT called "Bad movies we love" or something like that. For many years I traditionally watched it right before the Oscar broadcast. The "Airplane" of bad movies, the hilarious dialogue just keeps coming. I taped it from a pay TV source many years ago, but would also buy a pristine VHS or DVD copy. Jill St. John's finest hour. Struggling young actor,impatient for stardom, steps on everyone he meets on his way to an Oscar nomination. Terrible overacting by nearly everyone involved, and ridiculous,riotous dialogue make this a classic guilty pleasure. Made at a time when Hollywood was not yet consciously making "bad" movies. Great fun.</p>
