<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have similar feelings about this movie as a lot of the other reviewers.As kids, my friends and I used to rent it at all opportunities. I can still remember fighting in the car over who got to look at the cover! I watched it again a few years back. The plot seemed silly. The acting was no longer brilliant. Overall it dropped about 2 stars!But I still enjoyed seeing it again. It was good memories. Of course having Nicole Kidman in one of her first movies ever is also great fun to watch. Who'd have known she'd go on to become such hot property.P.s. She must spend a fortune keeping her hair straight!</p>
