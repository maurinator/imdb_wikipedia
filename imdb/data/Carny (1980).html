<p>Tired of her dull job as a waitress, Donna decides to join two carnival hustlers and see what life in their field is like.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If this didn't feature Gary Busey or Jodie Foster in it then this could easily be classed as an avant garde film. There is virtually no plot, just a cascade of freaks, fights and sex scenes. I'm not sure if it's any good - it seems unsure whether it wants to be arty or straight forward - but it's certainly interesting. Worth a look.</p>
