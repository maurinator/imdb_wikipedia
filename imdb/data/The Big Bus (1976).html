<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Big Bus" was released in 1976, four years before the landmark disaster flick-spoof, "Airplane!".  Why "The Big Bus" was not as popular a film is a mystery, because it is every bit as funny as "Airplane!".  The dialogue is witty, the sight gags are hilarious and plentiful, and the acting is just dead-pan enough to make it all work.  Joseph Bologna and Stockard Channing head up an all-star cast heading from New York to Denver on a nuclear-powered bus, which is supposed to make the trip with no stops, but of course, disasters ensue.  The bus is a luxury vehicle, complete with a piano bar, swimming pool, bowling alley and dining room.  If you haven't seen "The Big Bus" check it out.  It will make you laugh out loud.</p>
