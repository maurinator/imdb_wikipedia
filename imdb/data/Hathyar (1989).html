<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hathyar has been one of my fav movies since i first saw it as a kid. The scene where Sanjay runs behind the buck and then when he stands in the middle of the road while Amrita Singh is taken back to her house are classic. Great J.P.Dutta direction and absolutely stunning photography. Great acting and a powerhouse script. Sanjays helplessness as a son and Asha Parekh's struggle to keep sanity in the face of poverty and love for her son results in a winding struggle between right and wrong. The movie was made way ahead of its time as audiences in the 80s were still used to seeing Mithun jumping from ground level to the 1st floor. HA.. Hathyar a movie Not to be missed....</p>
