<h1>Ambush (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set during the World War 2. In the summer of 1941 the Finnish army crosses the border of Russia. A platoon led by Lt. Eero Perkola goes through the wilderness around the Lieksa lake to search for Russian defensive positions. The platoon kills some Russian civilians and rests in a newly conquered village. There Lt. Perkola meets his fiancée Kaarina, who is serving in the Women's Auxilary Corps (Lotta). Then the platoon continues with the mission, but a message about Kaarina's possible death reaches Lt. Perkola. The message causes Perkola to become distracted during the mission.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ok, "Rukajärven tie" was indeed a great war-film with several astounding scenes, but something started to annoy me in the latter half of the film. Oh yeah: why do the "Ryssäs" die like flies and Finnish soldiers in slow-motion, like real heroes (which don't simply exist in war).  Well, this is another veteran-pleaser from writer Antti Tuuri, but a lot better than "Talvisota" (Winter War). Very good, but not perfect.</p>
