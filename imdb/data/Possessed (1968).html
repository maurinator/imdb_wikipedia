<h1>Possessed (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David's friend Ted Willard has written to him for help, but the letter followed David around the country. He has finally arrived at Willard's clinic, only to discover that the doctor has suffered an accident and been under the psychiatric care of his brother Martin for several weeks. And Ted seems not to remember writing David at all! The answer to this mystery may rest with Adam Lane, and the special research he is doing at the Willard Clinic. Research that could pave the way for a nearly bloodless takeover of the Earth!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alien Adam Lane (William Smithers) is doing all sorts of mind-control experiments in his attempts to rule the earth.William Smithers shined twice with his guest roles in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964) and Star Trek (1966) but this script is missing the great dialogue of VTTBOTS and Trek.More effort seems to of been put in set design than anything else. That alien dish-thing that rotates all over the place is perhaps the most memorable thing about The Possessed. Also the lavish very 1960s use of colour in that house we keep seeing.This hour does not bring anything new to the table but for massive fans of this series (like me), The Possessed is enough to hold your attention.</p>
