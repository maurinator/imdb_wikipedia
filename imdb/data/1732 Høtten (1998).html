<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>På det lille stedet Høtten ble det for seks måneder siden begått et seksualdrap på 13 år gamle Katarina. Nå er det skjedd et nytt dødsfall - en av de to brødrene som mistenkes for det uoppklarte drapet blir funnet druknet. Dermed intensiveres etterforskningen. Forsterkninger kommer til stedet i form av den garvede Kripos-etterforskeren Nicholas Ramm (Reidar Sørensen). Etter hvert som Ramm går det lille samfunnet nærmere i sømmene, sniker det seg en uro inn under hans blå vinterfrakk. Fra å møte Høtten, med sin lekne urbane tilnærming, blir han drevet inn i et spill han etter hvert mister kontrollen over. Tvunget inn i et skjebnefelleskap mesannheten som et sjokk i det vinterbleke Høtten. Og den er langt verre enn Ramm hadde forestilt seg.</p>
<p>A few months after a girl with developmental disabilities is murdered in the remote village Høtten, the two young men who most townsfolk think killed her go missing. A police detective is sent to investigate and finds this very challenging.</p>
<p>A few months after a girl with developmental disabilities is sexually assaulted and murdered in Høtten, the two young men who most townsfolk think killed her go missing. When one is found drowned, Olso sends Nicholas Ramm to help - a world-weary detective whose investigative techniques are sometimes unconventional. Ramm runs into brick walls; people won't help him. Meanwhile, Niklas, the younger brother of the dead and missing suspects, faces constant hazing at school simply for being from the wrong family. Can Ramm sort things out, find the girl's killer, and win the lad and his family some respite from small-town cruelty?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had some expectations to this movie, and at least I hoped it would live up to one or two of them. But it didn't. It's an all so typical Norwegian film that I'm ashamed. I must say, the only Norwegian film I've ever seen and liked was "Moerkets oey" with a great soundtrack from the Norwegian band Seigmen. 1732 Hoetten, by the way, had Magne Furuholmen from A-Ha behind the music. Not that it could save this film.There comes a time when you are just tired of seeing the same Norwegian actors in all of our films. I released a big sigh when Aud Schøneman showed up..not that she's not a fantastic old lady, but can't they find *anybody* new? And of course, they mix in some swedish actors. That's funny, I haven't seen many norwegians in Swedish or danish movies, but still somehow we always seem to import those Swedes..I'm quite sure we have enough competent Norwegian actors that can replace some of the old faces, and some of the Swedes..but they never seem to get a chance to enter the film industry.The classical setting is of course all taken care of. A hillbilly's town far up north, where everyone knows everyone, and gangs of elder boys torture the youngsters. A strange priest, and a weird family. A girl that is killed. The awful torture of this one little boy, the horrible school. And a really cynical and strange expert from the police in a bigger city, whom is supposed to fix all their problems.Can't Norway contribute with something new soon? Please?</p>
