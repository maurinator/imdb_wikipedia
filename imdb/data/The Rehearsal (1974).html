<h1>The Rehearsal (1974)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It is a rather strange film, probably a bit too melodramatic....Shot in a warehouse in New York, the film tries to give a reconstruction of the vents in the Polytechnic School in Athens, Greece when 40 students were killed while protesting against the ruling junta.  You will find some interesting prople participating in the movie such as Lawrence Olivier, Maximillian Shell and Arthur Miller. The film was never shown in cinemas as the junta fell a few days after the shooting was finished.</p>
