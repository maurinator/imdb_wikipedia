<h1>Henry & June (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1931 Paris, Anais Nin meets Henry Miller and his wife June. Intrigued by them both, she begins expanding her sexual horizons with her husband Hugo as well as with Henry and others. June shuttles between Paris and New York trying to find acting jobs while Henry works on his first major work, "Tropic of Cancer," a pseudo-biography of June. Anais and Hugo help finance the book, but June is displeased with Henry's portrayal of her, and Anais and Henry have many arguments about their styles of writing on a backdrop of a Bohemian lifestyle in Paris.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>when this sort of thing seemed so cool. In all fairness, I only watched the first three quarters of this movie, but that's all I could stay awake for. Does anyone find all this talk about "liberation," "inner self," and so on, at all convincing? Just about every line lacks verisimilitude. Let's back up the TiVo for a minute... "I've never been with a woman I could be so sincere with." (I need to remember that one next time I'm in a bar.) "Everybody says sex is obscene. The only true obscenity is war." (Heavy, dude.) "I saw your true nature when you were dancing out there." (Another good pickup line.) "I'd love you at eleven--I love you now--I will love you at a hundred." (I'll be asleep at eleven.) Is this how Henry Miller really talked? Or is it merely how Anais Nin really wrote? Even her own lines: "I've been dying to write something about it--about how necessary this book is for our times. You gave us a blood transfusion." No actress could pull such a line off gracefully, and Maria de Medeiros is no exception.Beyond all that, how did they manage to goose this up to an NC-17 rating anyway? They must have paid someone off, for it's the only way they could have provoked any sort of buzz for this movie, and given anyone the impression that this would be worth sitting through. The sex scenes earned their classification as "erotic" primarily because everyone moves slowly, and they're filmed mostly in extreme close-up--but they weren't nearly as sexy as the shower scene in Porky's.Finally, Fred Ward can't pull off the bald look. He looked more like a monk with a shaved pate surrounded by a ring of thick, healthy hair.If the movie suddenly got terrific in the last half hour, then I apologize to everyone for misleading them. But I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
