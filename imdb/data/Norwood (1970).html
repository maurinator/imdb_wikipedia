<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Vietnam veteran returns to his Texas home but feels restless and decides to become a radio singer. Based on the novel by Charles Portis.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All the makings of a decent movie, at the time the world's most popular athlete and the world's most popular singer come together in a so-so movie. Namath's acting made Glen's Oscar caliber! I love Glen Campbell and that had a lot to do with the 8 rating I gave it. If Glen wasn't in it, I'd have given it a 3. If you can find the soundtrack, get it instead! Dom Delouise is in this movie if that helps your judgement and Kim Darby plays a weaker, pregnant Madie Ross(True Grit). Watch it anyway!</p>
