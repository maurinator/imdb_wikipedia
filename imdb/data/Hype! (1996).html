<h1>Hype! (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The world of grunge. This documentary examines the Seattle scene as it became the focus of a merging of punk rock, heavy metal, and innovation. Building from the grass roots, self-promoted and self-recorded until break-out success of bands like Nirvana brought the record industry to the Pacific Northwest, a phenomenon was born. More than just an examination of the music, this is a look at how this artistic movement became a societal and fashion trend with a major effect on American culture.</p>
<p>Documentary covering the growth and subsequent overexposure of the Seattle "grunge" music scene in the early 90s</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This documentary is, very simply, great. It is basically about the music scene in Seattle during and before the "grunge" scene exploded.I really liked how most of the people that were interviewed were not the really famous bands that everyone knows. Of course there is a part of that in the film, but it is not presented in a way that is really shoving it in your face like how all the mainstream media tends to do. It had more to do with the relatively unknown or underground music that erupted from Seattle during that time.I also liked how it was put together in a way that really gave you a solid history and background of the music that was present before "grunge", and how that music influenced the next generation of music, which then influenced the NEXT generation of music.As a whole, it is a very solid documentary that gives the perspective of the people who were around during the "grunge" movement, and the artists' opinions and responses to it. And, of course, there is a lot of fantastic music (and some not so much). ^_^ Enjoy.</p>
