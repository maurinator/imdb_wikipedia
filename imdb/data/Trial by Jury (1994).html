<h1>Trial by Jury (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Valerie is a juror in the trail of a mob boss. When her young son's life is threatened, she has no option other than to see that justice isn't done.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nothing like the main-stream Hollywood thriller. The characters are actually notably changed by the shocking experiences they experience, and not just enraged.It is a rarely nuanced look into female psychology. Comparable to "Bound" in that sence. They don't "kick ass" they have other priorities, different goals, different drivers - but not so different methods...It's realistic, surprising and entertaining. The actors shows a depth which I miss in most Hollywood productions. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and William Hurt are great - much better than their main-stream appearances.Take your time to see it. It won't change the way films are made, not break any records, but you are likely to come out with a different view on women.(Make sure to watch in 'Scope :-)Excuse my English.</p>
