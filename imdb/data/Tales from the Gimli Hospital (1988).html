<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The comments made above by "Spearin" express my own reaction to this film.  I rented it on DVD because it sounded intriguing, but fully expected to yank the disc before it fairly got underway.  To my pleased surprise, I was caught up in the story and captivated by the photography from the first seconds, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience--so much so, in fact, that I immediately replayed the movie with the director's often droll narration superimposed.  Also on the DVD I rented was a short film by the same author, "The Dead Father," which is well worth watching.  It, perhaps even more than "Tales from the Gimli Hospital," evokes early French surrealist film, but not in a slavish way.  Both films gave me food for thought--about film and about human relationships.  I guess this "nourishment" aspect of film-viewing is my basic criterion for judgment.  On that basis, I voted an "eight" for "Tales from the Gimli Hospital."By the way, I was very interested to learn (from the director's commentary) some of the actual history of Gimli and its settlers.  These were tough, courageous people.</p>
