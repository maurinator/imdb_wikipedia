<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was shown over the free channel last Sunday. I read up on the reviews for preparation to be unbiased and fair to it.I think the problem with this movie is a tired plot and a terribly two dimensional script. Keanu's and Charlize's performance was what helped to lift it out of a 4/10 rating for me. Jason Issac as a cross dressing flatmate was a heartwarming portrayal of how friendship does not always come in neat little packages hemmed in by our expectations. His loyalty and support for Charlize's Sara was the real cruncher in this movie for me. Nelson's initial shock and reaction on seeing Jason's Chaz in a loud dress was hilarious only because it does mirror the general population's.The other part of the movie that I find strangely revealing and therefore very endearing, was when Nelson decides Christmas should come a month early for Sara. He pops into her house via the window while everyone is having Thanksgiving and proceeds to give her twelve gifts for Christmas. Each gift and especially the last one, was obviously well thought out in relation to his feelings for her and their relationship throughout that November.I have read snippets of how Keanu is very fiercely protective, private, very loving and giving as a person to those he cares deeply about and that entire scene made me realize this is less acting the part but more a lingering snapshot of a small part of who he really is.I have so far watched "Speed", "A Walk in the Clouds" and the "Matrix" Trilogy, all of which showcases Keanu as a leading man. I must say that I do catch glimpses of what looks like the real Keanu popping up every now and then. So it's no wonder that Sandra Bullock should say that she was very taken by the way Keanu looked at her just before he kissed her at the end of "Speed".I think that many people are quick to rubbish Keanu's acting as wooden because they fail to notice that bit of his soul, often very obviously displayed on the screen, just because it usually isn't displayed on his face.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a simple love story with a bittersweet ending and you won't be disappointed.</p>
