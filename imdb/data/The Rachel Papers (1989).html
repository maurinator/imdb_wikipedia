<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have found "The Rachel Papers" to be a delightful mix of young convoluted romance, bittersweet in nature, and a bit of cute comedy.  I've seen the movie several times, having taped it in 1991, and find it refreshing each time I view it.I particularly enjoy the music soundtrack which I feel gives each scene its own distinctive flavor.  Dexter Fletcher plays an excellent role as an egotistical yet bumbling opportunist, and Ione Skye is outstanding as the target of Dexter's amorous intentions, and is somewhat equally nebulous of mind as is Dexter.It impresses me as a free-spirited production that does not require a great deal of laborious attention on the part of the viewer, and as such is truly entertaining.</p>
