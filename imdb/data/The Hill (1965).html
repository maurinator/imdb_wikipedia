<h1>The Hill (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>WWII, in a British disciplinary camp located in the Libyan desert. Prisoners are persecuted by Staff Sergeant Williams, who made them climb again and again, under the heavy sun, an artificial hill built right in the middle of the camp. Harris is a more human and compassionate guard, but the chief, S.M. Wilson, refuses to disown his subordinate Williams. One day, five new prisoners arrive. Each of them will deal in a different way with the authority and Williams' ferocity.</p>
<p>At a British military prison in North Africa during World War II, convicted British soldiers face harsh conditions and an even harsher staff. For Trooper Joe Roberts - reduced in rank from Sergeant Major and imprisoned for striking an officer - the going is particularly difficult. Sharing a cell with four other men, they are under the command of Staff Sergeant Williams, a particularly cruel task master who takes pleasure in imposing harsh punishment especially making the men run up and down the "hill" until they collapse from heat exhaustion. No matter the excesses, the prison Sergeant Major will always back up his men. When one of the prisoners dies however, there is an opportunity to expose Williams' for what he is.</p>
<p>In a North African military prison during World War II, five new prisoners struggle to survive in the face of brutal punishment and sadistic guards.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Stark images, powerful script and performances, and rapid, sharp editing make this film difficult to forget.  Director Sidney Lumet stamps his authority on the movie with a style that is gritty, almost documentary -like.  The quick cuts are precise, like the snap of the salutes and the bark of the NCO's.  Beyond Lumet's towering presence, there is a likeable performance from a young Ossie Davis, an excellent early non-Bond performance from Sean Connery, and Harry Andrews' Sargeant-Major is a remarkable creation - a little man whose job is to destroy these misfits on behalf of a system that will not tolerate individuals.This remarkable film stays in the mind long after viewing for me, mainly because it announces early on that it is not an easy picture, and like early Frankenheimer, it's aggressive style stands out from the norm.  It is a quintessential sixties picture - a time when experiments in style could be taken seriously - not just a smirky in-jokes or cartoonish roller -coaster rides.  Exhilarating nonetheless.</p>
