<h1>Blast of Silence (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Having been 'away' for some time, professional killer Frankie Bono returns to New York to do another job: assassinate some mid-level mobster. Although intending to avoid unnecessary 'contact' while carefully stalking his victim, Bono is recognized by an old fellow from the orphanage, whose calm and unambitious citizen's life and happy marriage contrast heavily with Bono's solitary and haunted existence. Exhausted and distracted, Bono makes another mistake, but his contract is not one to back out of.</p>
<p>After a hard life in a Cleveland orphanage, baby boy Frankie Bono grows up to be a hired killer, someone who prefers to be alone. And for good reason. His latest target is a second-string crime boss in New York. It won't pay Frankie to get seen. But he does get seen. The fat gun dealer, with pet rats, who haggles with Frankie on the price of a gun and a silencer, sees Frankie at a nightclub and figures out too much. An old friend from the orphanage sees him at a bar and convinces him - against his better judgment - to come to a Christmas party. The friend has a beautiful sister, someone Frankie remembers, someone special. She makes him vulnerable, emotional. And that's exactly what Frankie can't afford to be.</p>
<p>A hired killer from Cleveland has a job to do on a second-string mob boss in New York. But a special girl from his past, and a fat gun dealer with pet rats, each gets in his way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought the movie used the voice-over very well. I like the idea of a character allowing us into his mind and/or thought process while he goes about his daily business, especially an interesting profession such as being a hitman. Overall I thought the movie was suspenseful as well, with me cheering on Bono in the last scenes. I recommend this movie for anyone interested film in general.</p>
