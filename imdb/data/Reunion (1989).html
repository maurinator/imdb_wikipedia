<h1>Reunion (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two young boys from very different backgrounds become friends in 1933 Stuttgart. However, they don't realize how different they are until much later as one is the son of a well-to-do Jewish doctor and the other the son of a German aristocrat. After that summer and the election of Hitler, things change as anti-semitism gains fervor. After the core of the film deals with that era, the film flashes to the present and the Jewish man now returns to his boyhood home and seeks his old friend with some surprises.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie involves around two male teenagers. They spend most of their time together. They barely interact with any other classmates. It is a sweet boyhood friendship movie, but is it also hinting at a  homosexual relationship? There are so many other classmates that the newcomer could have picked, he picked this particular one.Generally speaking, this is a good movie. You won't even notice when it comes to an end. It seems to be so sudden.</p>
