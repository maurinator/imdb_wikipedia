<h1>A Cab for Three (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A taxi driver is given a difficult choice from 2 small time crooks: drive them around while they rob, or get locked up in the trunk.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Taxi para 3 (Taxi for 3) is about the sad life of many people in Chile. But is not a sad movie or a politic one. The curious and sometimes funny relation between two thieves and a cab driver shows all the moral misery in Chile nowadays. The three leading roles are just brilliant, and the script is very smart and well written. The line: "Â¿Volante o maleta?" (Wheel or trunk?) when the thieves are kidnapping the cab driver, is one of the most powerful in modern Chilean cinema, and resumes the world that Orlando Lubbert shows us. The only weak point is the photography, but doesn't bother watching this good movie with a good story, good acting and a good soundtrack.</p>
