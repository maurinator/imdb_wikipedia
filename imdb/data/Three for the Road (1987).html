<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A crafty political aide and his soft-spoken pal are assigned the job of delivering a senator's out-of-control teenage daughter to an institution.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Paul Tracy (Charlie Sheen) is an aide to his hero Republican US Senator Kitteredge (Raymond J. Barry) who is aiming for the White House. He meets Kitteredge for the first time and is given the task to drive his delinquent daughter Robin (Kerri Green) to be hidden away in an institution. She is sedated and he gets his roommate T.S. (Alan Ruck) to come along. She keeps trying to escape and telling them disturbing stories about the Senator. Robin and Paul fall for each other. She escapes and picks up Missy who is running away from stupid Junior. Robin is trying to find her absent mother Blanche (Sally Kellerman).It's too bad that Kerri Green fades away after this movie. She had a couple of great movies in the 80s. I wish she got a few more opportunities. She is as cute as ever in this movie even with her crazy hairdo. The three young actors are good. The story is a little bit awkward. It's not all funny since it's a little bit of a kidnapping. The romance works only because of the two young actors.</p>
