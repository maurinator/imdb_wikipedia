<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Wedding Planner" is a comedy and romance movie which has to do with a woman who is a wedding planner and she fell in love with a man who finally will be the groom of the most important wedding in her entire carrier. We watch her being in a dilemma and this has to do with what is she going to do, is she going to help the groom with his wedding or is she going to be his bride.In this movie we have a simple romance story between a simple woman with an important and rich man, a simple plot and direction by Adam Shankman. Also in this movie we have some good interpretation by Matthew McConaughey who plays as Steve Edison and I am sure that he want to forget this movie as fast as he can and Jennifer Lopez who plays as Mary Fiore.If you are a fan of romance movies then "The Wedding Planner" is a movie which I am sure that you will love it. If you are not fan then just do not watch this movie and do not lose your time on it.</p>
