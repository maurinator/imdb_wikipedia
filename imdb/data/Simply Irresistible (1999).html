<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Simply Irresistible is one of my absolutely favorite movies. Typically I like your "guy movies" ... you know, explosions and blood, but this movie hits on my softer nerves. It's such an amazing movie for those that believe in love, and the craziness of the whole deal. Those those like a practical film, keep on looking! but here you have a light and greatly acted film. The people who suggest that this film is not worth your time, well clearly they didn't understand the film. It's all about following your heart, and excepting the fact that love can oft times bring unexpected changes in one's life and great consequences. A great soundtrack and engaging story just add to my love for this film as well.</p>
