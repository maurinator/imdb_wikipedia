<h1>Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story picks up at the point where "The Robe (1953)" ends, following the martyrdom of Diana and Marcellus. Christ's robe is conveyed to Peter for safe-keeping, but the emperor Caligula wants it back to benefit from its powers. Marcellus' former slave Demetrius seeks to prevent this, and catches the eye of Messalina, wife to Caligula's uncle Claudius. Messalina tempts Demetrius, he winds up fighting in the arena, and wavers in his faith.</p>
<p>In 1st century Rome, Christian slave Demetrius is sent to fight in the gladiatorial arena and Emperor Caligula seeks Jesus' robe for its supposedly magical powers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, so it is not historically correct and contains  a dramatic personality change by Susan Hayward, I still love this movie.  The film has some surprisingly witty dialogue, a rousing music soundtrack, high production values and very good performances all around.  If you can accept the story for the fiction it is it can be surprisingly inspirational even if you are not Christian.  My wife and I watch it at least once yearly.</p>
