<h1>A Raisin in the Sun (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Walter Lee Younger is a young man struggling with his station in life. Sharing a tiny apartment with his wife, son, sister and mother, he seems like an imprisoned man. Until, that is, the family gets an unexpected financial windfall...</p>
<p>Givng us entitled whites some insight into what must be an infuriating wall of denial and obstructions to the 'good life' in the United States, "Raisin in the Sun" also shows us the dreams and ways to realize the same thing. What is especially symbolic is the overlay of hypocrisy represented by the white "Neighborhood Outreach", which attempts to persuade the Younger family that "you would be happier with your own kind". The author allows you to think the young protagonist is headed for the ruin that so many from the Southside and the South come to, until something called 'pride' kicks in.</p>
<p>A substantial insurance payment could mean either financial salvation or personal ruin for a poor black family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My applause goes to director, Daniel Petrie, for a masterpiece movie that concentrated on one set of a black family's small apartment, in the projects of Chicago. This movie shows every hardship that black families went through in the fifties. A Raisin in the Sun movie is a remake of Lorraine Hansberry's classic stage play of how a black family tries to escape from their crowded apartment life to a house in an all white neighborhood. Sidney Politer delivered his usual outstanding performance in this film, which sends a message about the limited opportunities open to blacks in this time period. My favorite character was Mama, played by Claudia McNeil. She did an excellent job showing how the mother is always the backbone of black families through every trial and tribulation. I am not usually a fan of black and white movies, but this movie displayed a wonderful storyline for me to understand the struggle they went through. There was never a movie that I can think of that was this excellent with one set most of the movie and was in black and white. The part of the movie that meant a lot to me is how Mama took the money she received and did something with it that would benefit the whole family. Overall, each main character portrayed a strong black person. For example, Walter Lee realized that he is suppose to follow behind his father and be a strong black man and raise a family. Ruth always stood by her husband no matter his wrongs, Beneatha was a young black student going to college to be doctor and Mama was just their for any of her family member's and remain strong for everyone.</p>
