<h1>Wind (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>BOUND BY THE WIND is a portrait of the enormous human costs of the Cold War nuclear arms race as well as the secrecy, negligence and deceit which characterized the superpowers' nuclear testing programs. The documentary is structured around the dramatic stories of several down-winders from the United States, the former Soviet Union and the South Pacific who have become committed activists in the global movement to achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. The film interweaves the down-winders' stories of fallout, deception, birth defects and cancer with the relevant historical events, archival footage and analysis from activists, experts and government officials. It also documents some of the major legal fights for justice and compensation over the health damage caused by nuclear testing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This half-hour long video documentary takes an informative and sobering look at some of the consequences of nuclear testing, and also presents a more optimistic introduction to the many grassroots organizations, at home and abroad, trying to put an end to them (with more success inside the Soviet Union than here). Director David L. Brown was allowed to meet several Soviet anti-nuke activists (something unthinkable only a few years earlier), and compares their stories with those of American protesters downwind of the Yucca Flat testing range. The strongest images in the video are still those showing the awesome power and terrible beauty of the detonations themselves, which not even the end of the Cold War could apparently stop. The point is never made in so many words but comes across loud and clear: with the American testing program in Nevada, the Russians in Kazakhstan, the Chinese at Lop Nor, and the French in the South Pacific, we can now all consider ourselves 'down winders'.</p>
