<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Nidhanaya is generally considered to be the classic Sri Lankan film. Number I in most anyone's desert island collection of Lankan films. Lester James Peiris takes a powerful story and weaves a tapestry of wonderfully engaging images shot in austere black and white. It is bold film making from a person very much in command of his style and technique. Lester James Peiris was never again to reach such virtuosity in his stellar career.A great ensemble cast, award winning script by Tissa Abeysekera, incredibly potent music from Premasiri Khemadasa and poetic cinematography by the under rated M.S. Anandan make this film a must watch.</p>
