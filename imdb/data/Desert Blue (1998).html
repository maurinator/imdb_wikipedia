<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'd like to preface any comments with the fact that i liked this movie. It was a good watch, and i really enjoyed it. I was never much of a kate hudson fan, but after watching this one it's impossible not to love that girl :o)I can't stand the people on imdb that write these over-analytical, hollywood bullsh*t analyses; so i'll keep this one simple and to the point: Solid romantic plot, fun dialogue, and interesting characters. I also had fun recognizing some of the people in this film who play lesser roles, who are more notable from other movies/tv shows (i.e. "darlene" from roseanne, peter mcallister--the dad from home alone, and the head fbi agent--from starship troopers just to name a few). I don't want to brand any of these actors with these roles; it's just that i'd find myself watching and go: I know that person!Well, that's all i got here...give it a watch :o)</p>
