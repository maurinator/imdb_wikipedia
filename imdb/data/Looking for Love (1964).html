<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Libby has spent a whole month trying to get into show business with her singing, and has not made it. Therefore she decides to retire and get a job where she can meet the right man and get married. The right man turns out to be Paul Davis when she sees him at the supermarket. The only problem is that Paul ignores her as his ideal woman is TnT (tall and top heavy), which Libby is not. One day, Libby creates a clothes stand which she calls the 'Lady Valet'. This product interests Paul who wants to promote it. Paul gets Libby on the 'Tonight Show' to push the product and when she mentions that she was formerly a singer, Johnny asks her to sing. After that, the career in showbiz that she had not found grows, to the astonishment of Paul. She uses her new fame to get Paul's attention.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>You have to admit that Connie Francis is a trooper. She gives energy to her role, no matter how ridiculous the sets, music, talent, dancing, etc., that they surround her with."Looking for Love" is another of those young-woman-frantic-to-find-love stories. It is certainly not one of the best. The script is sophomoric. Only a cast of towering talent could save it, so Francis was lucky she shares the screen with luminaries like Jesse White and Jim Hutton. Then they added Johnny Carson, George Hamilton, Danny Thomas and others, playing themselves--so many that this might be the first reality show.This film is a reminder of the tacky decorating sensibilities of the early sixties, but it can be fun to revisit the silly styles, just like the dance "the twist".To be fair, some of the music is good. But the story is the huge, uninteresting elephant in the room. No one could really care what happens to the characters. Watch it as a period piece to enjoy the kitsch and the corniness of its time.</p>
