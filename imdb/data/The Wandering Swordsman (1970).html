<h1>The Wandering Swordsman (1970)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a quite traditional Chinese Martial film, by legendary Hong Kong director Chang Cheh. The leading man David Chiang is a superstar during 70s', you'll see his face a lot in Chang's other movies. This movie "You Xia Er"(Wandering Swordsman, in English), is about a young man who is cheated into a trap, and fight back when he finds out later. The plot is nothing special, but the way Chang put the so called "Jiang Hu"("River and Lake", means the society for swordsmen) is marvelous. The Motel, the gamble house, the guards, everything is so real and attracting. Also the way Mr. Chiang acted as "You Xia Er", with the smile always around his mouth, like he doesn't care about anything (he does in deed), is just what I thought Chinese swordsman should look like.Excellent movie, far more better than most of nowadays clich√© martial ones.</p>
