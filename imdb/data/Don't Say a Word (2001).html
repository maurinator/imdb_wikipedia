<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was a very dramatic and suspenseful thriller and the film is never boring. So I can only say a word: G R E A T. Michael Douglas played as usual good in the role as a psychiatrist. Also good performance from Skye McCole as Jessie the little girl. There are some scary scenes. I will add no doubt this DVD to my best of collection. If you liked this movie you shouldnÂ´t miss "KISS THE GIRLS" also from director Gary Fleder or "SINGLE WHITE FEMALE" from Barbet Schroeder. Believe me you will not be disappointed. I think the film is too underrated. I give it a minimum of 8/10.</p>
