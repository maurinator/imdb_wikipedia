<h1>The Spirit of St. Louis (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Biography of Charles Lindburgh from his days of precarious mail runs in aviation's infancy to his design of a small transatlantic plane and the vicissitudes of its takeoff and epochal flight from New York to Paris in 1927.</p>
<p>A Hollywood version of Charles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic solo flight from New to Paris. Lindbergh had been a flier in the Army Air Corps and subsequently flew in air shows and delivering the mail by air. He had the $25,000 Orteig prize in his sights as a means of paying for the flight. He travels to California and works with Ryan Aircraft to build a brand new airplane specifically designed for the solo trip. He departed in the early hours of May 20, 1927 arriving at Paris Le Bourget airfield just over 33 hours later and thus making aviation history.</p>
<p>Charles Lindbergh's historic, epic solo trans-Atlantic flight in 1927, the first ever solo crossing of the Atlantic in an airplane. We see how Lindbergh set about organising financiers for his flight, purchasing, designing and building the plane, test flights, (through news on other fliers) the potential fates awaiting him and the flight itself, especially the hardships he had to endure and how he overcame them. We also see, though flashbacks, his earlier life - how he learnt to fly and his first few jobs in aviation.</p>
<p>Charles 'Slim' Lindbergh struggles to finance and design an airplane that will make his New York to Paris flight the first solo transatlantic crossing.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A great movie about triumph over all the nay-sayers who try to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. I won't go on about it, other than to say that I liked to reflect on the this film when I'm facing something  particularly daunting, and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I can certainly face the task before me. Definitely a "feel good" movie.See it.  You won't be disappointed.</p>
