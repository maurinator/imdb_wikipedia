<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not a blaxploitation film. Based on the novel by Iceberg Slim(apparently a "trick baby" himself),this is an interesting and original twist on the con man theme. And yes,it could have influenced Mamet. The con men, their relationship with Dot(Dallas Edward Hayes) and the real estate swindle bring to mind Mamet's House of Games and Glengary Glenross. Trick Baby contains serious social and moral implications that make it more akin to Felini's Il Bidone(The Swindlers)than to either Skin Game(71) or The Sting(73). The basic problem for me is that the plot doesn't build from the character and milieu established in the first half of the film. The second half becomes somewhat typical,sacrifices characterization for action,and meanders. The scene with Reverend Josephus, goes on too long and kills the momentum. One of the stings, involving a man and a deliberately dropped wallet is confusing because it's not clear how the con works. Kiel Martin and Mel Stewart never break character,work well with and against each other, and Hayes is terrific. The rest of the cast varies in quality. The settings and locations are evocative and well-chosen. Larry Yust's direction, like the editing, is not consistently good. An interesting and watchable film that deserves more attention. Let's hope for a DVD release.</p>
