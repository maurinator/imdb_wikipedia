<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Wartime secret agents are on a mission to destroy a deadly new type of torpedo hidden in a Nazi stronghold in France.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In Enemy Country is an OK time filler about undercover agents trying to stop the Germans from developing a super torpedo during WWII. The action is a bit bland for much of the picture, but the final sequence is quite taut. Anthony Franciosca heads the cast and delivers a tolerable performance, but he lacks the range of expression to do anything really interesting with the role. Anyone who is interested in WWII will probably enjoy it, and anyone who likes impossible mission flicks set deep behind enemy lines will be well satisfied.</p>
