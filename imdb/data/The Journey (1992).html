<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not a comment, this is a warning. My personal ranking (1,350 movies) sets this one at the bottom. I could talk about its pointless story, lack of good actors, no script at all, boring and stupid political satire, overcooked surrealism, corny dialogs, etc. I am plenty of reasons. But the most important of them deserves an explanation: This films is a landmark in my record as a movie snob because I chose working instead of watching a movie. A took an unauthorized break in my job and came to the theater. I chose "El Viaje" because at that time -early '90- Solanas was at least his own legend. Well, after 50 minutes of torture I returned to my job, hopeless, depressed and angry. After that, I promise to myself not to watch a Solanas'movie never, never in my life. Nevermore. And I kept my promise.</p>
