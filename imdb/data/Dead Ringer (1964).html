Jim Hobbson, a Los Angeles detective who loved the "dead" Edith.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, after eighteen years without speaking to each other, Edith Phillips meets her twin sister Margaret de Lorca in the funeral of Maggie's husband and former love of Edith that died of heart attack. Maggie invites Edith to visit her mansion, and Edith finds through her sister's driver that Maggie used a fake pregnancy to trick her and marry her passion. When Edith arrives in her bar, she is evicted by her landlord. Edith calls Maggie, kills her and assumes her identity. The police, including her boyfriend Sergeant Jim Hobbson, believe that Edith committed suicide in an act of despair. Edith lures Maggie's servants and friends, but when Maggie's lover Tony Collins appears, the situation becomes complicated for her.</p>
<p>After eighteen years of estrangement, twin sisters Edith 'Edie' Phillips and Margaret 'Maggie' DeLorca are reunited at the funeral of Maggie's husband, Francesco 'Frank' DeLorca, who died of cardiac arrest. Their estrangement was due to the fact that callous Maggie stole wealthy Frank from Edie when Frank and Edie were dating. As such, Maggie went on to live a life of luxury, while Edie currently owns a seedy bar on which she is three months behind in rent. To gain what she believes is rightfully hers after she finds out some information about how Maggie coerced Frank to marry her, Edie decides to murder Maggie and take on her identity. In doing so, Edie plans on passing off the dead body as herself, the death by suicide. In taking on Maggie's identity, Edie has to convince Maggie's servants, acquaintances and friends that she really is Maggie. The most difficult of these people to convince may be golf pro Tony Collins, who had a somewhat secret and special relationship with Maggie about which Edie was initially unaware. Edie may also have some problems convincing Sgt. Jim Hobbson, who is investigating Edie's death and who is also Edie's boyfriend. The problems for Edie posing as Maggie are compounded when she discovers the circumstances behind Frank's death.</p>
<p>The working class twin sister of a callous wealthy woman impulsively murders her out of revenge and assumes the identity of the dead woman. But impersonating her dead twin is more complicated and risky than she anticipated.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Many of the films of the 60s were boring as hell. It took a star like Bette Davis to bring the necessary fire to this double role as twins in "Dead Ringer." In other hands, this might have been unworthy, but with Davis' magical screen presence, you can't take your eyes off her (both of her!) Even in small scenes, she's real and radiant (when Jim gives her the watch for her birthday). Andre Previn's score is superb. I loved the music after Edith storms out of Margaret's bedroom in the beginning of the film when she sees the portrait of her sister's dead husband and HER former lover, followed by that tender moment with the butler.With the performances that got Oscar nominations during the '60s, some were pretty dull. Compared to them, Bette deserved a nod for best actress. Davis was wonderful in this. Her years of acting experience before the cameras was on full display in every scene...she was the consummate professional.Did you notice Perry Blackwell at the organ? She also appeared in the Doris Day/Rock Hudson hit,"Pillow Talk" as the nightclub singer a few years prior. The drummer in this was married to Nancy Wilson!</p>
