<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Claude and Ellen are best friends who live in a not-so-nice area of New York. They're involved in the subculture of 90s youth, complete with drugs, live music, and homophobia. All is changed one night when a violent and meaningless death rocks their lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All Over Me is a film that isn't so much about telling a story as much as it is about feelings and emotions within the characters that are not so obvious at first.  The intentions and desires of the characters unfolds as the movie progresses at a very slow pace, and the dialog is intentionally bland, not sharp in any way, as if it was real life.  There is no attempt by the filmmaker or actors to make this look like it is a movie, beyond some rather artsy shots here and there.  It is simply a window into a young girls life and the small, confused, somewhat corrupted world that surrounds her while she is making another transition in her development in life.  This is a very subtle film with very few shifts in tone.  The action that leads to the most drastic shift in the film is not even seen, only talked about later on.  Even the more climatic moments result in not much happening, though tension does build on a number of occasions.  The acting is top notch.  In fact, the acting is so superb that it almost makes me wish that the script had just a little more zing to it since the actors could have definitely pulled off some colorful dialog and made for some classic scenes.  Regardless of that, All over Me is a good enough film, though if you can't get into the characters or want to see a movie that feels like a movie and not a documentation of life, you won't dig it.</p>
