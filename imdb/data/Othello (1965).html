<h1>Othello (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Desdemona defies her father to marry the Moor of Venice, the mighty warrior, Othello. But Othello's old lieutenant, Iago, doesn't like Othello, and is determined to bring about the downfall of Othello's new favorite, Cassio, and destroy Othello in the process, by casting aspersions on Othello's new bride.</p>
<p>Iago, Venetian army officer and ensign to the Moorish general, Othello, bitterly resents the appointment of Cassio as Othello's lieutenant. Roderigo and Iago maliciously bait Brabantio, an old senator, with the news that his daughter Desdemona is betrothed to Othello. Before Council Chamber, Brabentio accused Othello of abducting his daughter. The Moor denies this, and Desdemona affirms loyalty to her husband. Othello is ordered to defend Cyprus, of which he is Governor, against the Turks. Iago assures Roderigo, who is secretly in love with Desdemona, that she will not love Othello for long. Iago brings Desdemona to Cyprus to celebrate Othello's victory against the Turks and incites Cassio and Montano into a drunken brawl. Montano is seriously hurt and Iago beckons Othello, blaming Cassio, who is dismissed from duties. Iago then advises Cassio to seek Desdemona's assistance in regaining Othello's favor. Iago arranges Othello to find his wife in earnest conversation with Cassio, and subtly arouses the Moor's jealousy with creating a slanderous piece of evidence by placing Desdemona's handkerchief in the possession of Cassio.</p>
<p>The duplicitous ensign Iago secretly hates Othello, a Moor and the general of the Venetian army. Othello is newly married to the chaste Desdemona; but he believes Iago's lie that his lieutenant, Cassio, has been cuckolding him--a lie that leads to tragedy.</p>
<p>A general's marriage is destroyed when a vengeful lieutenant convinces him that his new wife has been unfaithful.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Olivier got a lot of flack at the time for the Al Jolson performance, from people who failed to take into account the exaggeration of gesture and make-up that goes with a stage production.  That's all it is, a film of a stage production, but visually the stage design is good and the photography presents it excellently.</p>
