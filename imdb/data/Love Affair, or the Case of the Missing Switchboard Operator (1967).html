<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That European cinema did things differently in the 1960s is not in doubt, as even directors from little-renowned cinematic cultures such as Yugoslavia delighted in new-found freedom.  On one hand, "Switchboard Operator" is a simple tale of love, betrayal and tragedy in Belgrade, and as such captures some touching details about trapped lives in a totalitarian society. However, director Dusan Makavejev, clearly under the influence of Godard, adopts an offhand approach to his narrative, and introduces extraneous material at tangents to the main story.  Most of this stuff is fascinating, particularly when he uses archive footage of Yugoslav history.  Less successful are the interjections of two tedious academics, a sexologist and a criminologist, whose stern pronouncements jar against the film's capricious tone.  Nonetheless, this is invigorating film-making which reaches into some strange regions.  Despite an economical running time of 69 minutes, the film even finds time for a brief history of how the grey rat infested Europe!</p>
