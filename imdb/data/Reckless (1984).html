<h1>Reckless (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rebellious football player Johnny falls for cheerleader Tracy. They come from opposite backgrounds; she's from a comfortable well off family, his is poor and broken. Tracy already has a boyfriend but he acts like a jerk, so Johnny has to win Tracy's heart - something she seems reluctant to let him do.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie when I saw it on cable back in 1985. It was dealt with normal suburban life rather than these kids had money and felt like they were snobs. I saw it as Randy had this hot chick Tracey and Tracey wanted something else - Johnny Rourke. I loved the soundtrack and I wish some of the songs were released. I do remember INXS, Kim Wilde and Romeo Void (who can ever forget that dance scene between Johnny and Tracey, making Randy so mad that he stopped dancing with Mary Pat). This was good that I myself was in high school that I saw this film and I thought it was charming. I liked that Tracey's brother actually liked Johnny, while Randy and Tracey's friends (Kathy, Mary Pat and Karen) did not like him. I also like the cast of the film.</p>
