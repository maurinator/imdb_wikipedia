<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I Despised "Free Willy"... i thought it was fruity and stupid. But i likes this movie! Sure it's got a bit of a flimsy storyline, but it's your typical 90's kiddie film. But i still enjoyed it, oddly enough... I really DIDNT think i would, but i did! That's probably just because Elijah Wood was in it. He was funny and before Lord ofThe Rings, people characterized Elijah Wood as , "he was the guy in Flipper"sure, i wouldnt see it more than once or twice, but it's pretty fun to sorta make fun of with some of your close friends. I give this movie a 6 outta 10. Better than the average movie out there, but not amazing or anything. Hey, at least It's notdisney, right?</p>
