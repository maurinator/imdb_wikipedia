<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Whoever said dog is man's best friend never met Mij! Mij is a cute, cuddly pet shop otter who captures the heart of Graham Merill (Bill Travers). It doesn't take Graham long to realize that London is no place to raise a slippery otter. So he takes Mij to live in a ramshackle cottage on the coast of Scotland. Together they set out to explore the curious and magnificent natural wonders that surround their seaside home--from orphaned geese to tooth-less sharks. While Mij spends his days frolicking in the icy cold sea, Graham finds himself falling in love with the beautiful town doctor, Mary (Virginia McKenna). Before long, the three become inseparable friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you ever feel like giving up the rat-race of the city life and a hectic job, see this film.  Ring of Bright water is a getting-away-from-it-all kind of movie set in the Gaelic-speaking Western Isles of Scotland.  The busy London professional decides to take a broken-down croft house, fix it up, write and be creative.  He accomplishes all these things but finds the friendship and love of a woman and as well as a dear otter.  There are some scenes with Gaelic dialog to add reality to the film.  The bittersweet end will bring a tear to even the most hardened big-business type.  Great movie for a rainy day or a cozy evening - positive, uplifting.</p>
