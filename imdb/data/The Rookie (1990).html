<p>Clint Eastwood plays a veteran detective who gets stuck with a rookie cop (Charlie Sheen) to chase down a German crook (Raul Julia.)</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Clint Eastwood starred in and directed this predictably low-rated film about an aged cop with a reluctance to accept a newly-recruited rookie assistant (played by Charlie Sheen) in his undercover police operations. Unfortunately, for a number of reasons why this is a film with a 2/10 rating (or even 1/10) is that it doesn't live up to the usual Eastwood expectations and is really bad with a very lame plot. It is probably one of Eastwood's worst films let down by course of unexciting action that is not helped by its type of violence and worsened by levels of overacting and bad language. All these things seem to go over the top and there is also a bad cast and not even the likes of Charlie Sheen or the late Raul Julia (of Addams Family fame) could lift the gloom of this being the worst film but thankfully, the great Clint Eastwood only did few bad films and if I like violent action films, I watch Arnie in Commando instead.</p>
