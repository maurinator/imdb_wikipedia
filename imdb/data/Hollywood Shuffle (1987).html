<h1>Hollywood Shuffle (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bobby Taylor wants to be a respected actor. From Sam Spade to Shakespeare to superheros, he can do it all. He just has to convince Hollywood that gangstas, slaves and "Eddie Murphy-types" aren't the sum of his talents.</p>
<p>An actor limited to stereotypical roles because of his ethnicity, dreams of making it big as a highly respected performer. As he makes his rounds, the film takes a satiric look at African American actors in Hollywood.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>. . . just the idea of having the audacity to finance a major movie using one's credit cards.  And while it's unclear what those card companies thought of the project, the movie-going public are the recipients. Robert Townsend, infant terrible of the late 80s makes a splashy, dynamic debut in "Hollywood Shuffle."  There's no doubting Townsend's unbridled energy, imagination, and punch.  Here's a man who has something to say, and uses comedy, parody and satire to make his points. How the film will appeal depends on individual tastes.  However, Townsend has assembled a good looking cast, which throws itself into the proceedings with enthusiasm and verve.  More power, Mr. Townsend.</p>
