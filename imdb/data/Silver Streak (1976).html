<h1>Silver Streak (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A somewhat daffy book editor on a rail trip from Los Angeles to Chicago thinks that he sees a murdered man thrown from the train. When he can find no one who will believe him, he starts doing some investigating of his own. But all that accomplishes is to get the killer after him.</p>
<p>George Caldwell is an overworked author, taking the "Silver Streak" from Los Angeles to Chicago. His problem is not getting on the train, but staying on the train. After witnessing a dead man being thrown off the train, George must find out the truth behind the murder. By plane, by train and by car, George and his unlikely sidekick, Grover Muldoon, a thief, must solve the mystery without having to be thrown off the train and save Caldwell's new girlfriend, Hilly Burns.</p>
<p>George Caldwell is taking a slow restful trip to Chicago on the Silver Streak. Or so he thinks. He's involved in a love affair, a murder, is thrown from the train, wanted by the police, and joins forces with a car thief to re-board the train to save his love.</p>
<p>On a long-distance train trip, a man finds romance but also finds himself in danger of being killed, or at least pushed off the train.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw this movie in 1976 when I was all but about 13 years of age, with some friends in my home town (Dryden, Ontario) at the local "Royal" theatre, as it was known then. I just finished watching my VHS copy of it, which brings my total number of viewings up to 30-something...Why do I like this film so much? It was the first movie I've seen that had it all: action, suspense, romance, a lot of laughs, but most of all - adventure. All of this helped manufacture a great storyline. In short, one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen, and I enjoy myself greatly with each repeated viewing. It made me a big fan of the Wilder/Pryor combination. It made me a huge fan of train travel. It made me a "road movie" fanatic.A classic in my book. 9/10</p>
