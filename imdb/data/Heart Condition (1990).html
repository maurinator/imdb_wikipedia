<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very cute... one of my all time favorites. Anyone who finds this racially offensive misses the point.(It is really an ironic take on bigotry.) Just a fun and entertaining, light comedy. Both actors serve it well. Not Shakespeare of course, but engaging. As I said, one of my favs! Since I must write more to satisfy the requirements of this comment, let me also say that Bob Hoskins and Denzel Washington both shine in this satire on narrow thinking and the fact that skin color has nothing to do with love nor competency. Two thumbs up! Though I've said every thing I feel is relevant without giving away the plot I must continue to type or I will not be able to post my comment, so type away I must. This is a ridiculous requirement, but rules are rules. Some of us are are very succinct in our thinking and comments and therefore can express in a little, a lot. Hope you get a chance to check out this flick. I don't think you will regret it.;)</p>
