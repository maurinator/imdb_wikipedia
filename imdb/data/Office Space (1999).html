<p>Three engineers have had enough of the daily grind working their dull, mundane jobs at Initech Corporation. Subjected to filling out useless forms, fighting with faulty office equipment, and their obnoxious boss Bill Lumbergh are enough to drive anyone crazy. There's also other odd characters like Tom Smykowski and Milton Waddams. When Initech announces that they're bringing in "consultants" to "clean house" (read: fire a bunch of programmers so that means a nice big bonus for the boss), Michael, Samir, and Peter scheme to reclaim their freedom with a software programming scheme that aims to take Initech for a small fortune through a virus that is designed to skim a little off the top. Unfortunately thanks to a typo, that virus skims a lot off. Realizing they don't have much time the three scramble to cover their tracks, but constantly shoot themselves in the foot. Can they recover and get out of their predicament safely? And will Milton reclaim his famous red stapler?</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It still boggles my mind that this classic working-person's comedy was overlooked at the box office. Unlike today's dumbed-down, unfunny comedy-schlock, Office Space's script was carefully written before the camera began shooting. Based on his Milton shorts, Mike Judge wrote and directed Office Space and did a great job. The film is cleverly written, nicely plotted and paced, and holds interest even after repeated viewings (something I can not say for most comedies).Peter (Ron Livingston) and his friends have a permanent case of 'the Mondays.' Stuck in dead end programming jobs in an uncaring corporate environment, with a series of ridiculous, annoying and dysfunctional co-workers, Peter has motivation problems. At the request of his equally aggravating girlfriend, he subjects himself to occupational therapy via hypnotism, but just as he reaches a deep trance state, the hypnotist drops dead, and Peter is left in a state of blissful lack of inhibitions. And as things begin to go wrong, they actually get better through the films twisted (but oh so truthful) logic.Ron Livingston leads a nicely cast group of actors, including an early appearance by the now-famous Jennifer Aniston. Diedrich Bader is especially memorable for his heroic portrayal of Lawrence, the next-door neighbor and guru. And Ron Coleman and Stephen Root are wonderful.I have seen Office Space at least ten times, and it, remarkably, does not get old. The recent tendency to dumb-down comedic film exhibits contempt for its own audience. A return to comedies that don't punish people for thinking would make me a fan of the genre, and this would be a great example to draw from.</p>
