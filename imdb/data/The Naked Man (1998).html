<h1>The Naked Man (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man takes matters into his own hands when a pharmaceutical kingpin moves into his town to cause some real trouble.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The director has, on a low budget, created a tight script, with beautiful timing.  Rapaport plays a pro wrestler (whose persona is "The Naked Man")/chiropractor who is thrust into responding to an attempted gangland takeover of his small town.  Wonderfully acted from the chain smoking cynical cops, to the paraplegic gangster, to his Elvis impersonating enforcer, and finally to the biker girlfriend follower.  All the little bits were perfect and the movie was a hilarious comedy.</p>
