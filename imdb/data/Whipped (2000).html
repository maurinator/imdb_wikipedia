<h1>Whipped (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in New York, 'Whipped' is about a group of three single men, buddies from college, whom meet every Sunday at their local diner hangout to discuss their favorite sport: scoring with women. Their conversations (always revealing, sometimes revolting, and occasionally riotous) revolve around the weekend past and the girls that these three egotistical and narcissistic swingers were able or unable to "scam." However, when all three single guys unknowingly go after the same "perfect" woman, Mia (Amanda Peet), they begin to question their skirt-chasing ways. Squabbling breaks out amongst the group as they compete for her attention and suddenly, the fate of their ritual and their friendships, becomes uncertain. Who will win the morning round table bragging rights? You'll be surprised.</p>
<p>Three egotistical swingers, who think they're God's gift to women, end up having their friendships tested when all three of them pick up and start dating the same woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It appears the writer, director managed to hoodwink the money people into distributing this tasteless piece of garbage. I normally don't pan a film, but this was embarrassing and completely disgusting. The dialogue was a stream of foul words, over & over. Amanda Peet is gorgeous, and I do understand the motive behind the plot. However, I've never sat with my girlfriends and discussed such sexual behavior to the nth degree, and never would I, esp. in a restaurant. Its as if the writer tried to encompass every "dirty" thing he could think of, and then pretend to spin a story around it, to validate this drivel. Its been a sad & sorry summer, for sure.</p>
