<h1>The Caine Mutiny (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the World War II, the crew of a small insignificant ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet experience an event unlike any event ever experience by the United States Navy. A Ship's Captain is removed from command by his Executive Officer in an apparent outright act of mutiny. As the trial of the mutineers unfold, it is learned that the Captain of the ship was mentally unstable, perhaps even insane. The Navy must decide if the Caine Mutiny was a criminal act, or an act of courage to save a ship from destruction at the hands of her Captain?</p>
<p>After graduating from Midshipman's school, Ensign Willis Seward Keith is assigned to the USS Caine a decrepit, 20-year old converted ship equipped for mine sweeping. The officers of the Caine include the Exec, Lt. Steve Maryk and the Communications officer, Lt. Tom Keefer. Willie's not too impressed with the ship's Captain and is pleased when he learns that they are to get a new commanding officer in the form of Lt. Cdmr. Philip F. Queeg. Queeg is an odd duck whose leadership skills are sorely tested. Tom Keefer takes a dislike to him and plants in Steve Maryk's mind the idea that Queeg may be mentally unbalanced. It all comes to a head in a typhoon when Merrick puts Queeg on the sick list, leading to his court-martial where he is defended by a very able lawyer, Barney Greenwald.</p>
<p>A group of officers get a new captain during WW II. The new captain is different and they begin to suspect his sanity. In wartime, will he endanger them? Will they have to remove him from command? Will they be charged with mutiny in time of war if they do?</p>
<p>When a US Naval captain shows signs of mental instability that jeopardizes the ship, the first officer relieves him of command and faces court martial for mutiny.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Director Edward Dmytryk and screenwriter Stanlet Roberts, adapting Herman Wouk's novel, certainly didn't set out to make an anti-Navy movie concerning a junkyard Naval ship beset with a paranoid captain, and indeed their "simple" dedication at the end is to the entire United States Navy, yet the plot mechanisms are slanted in that direction even if the handling is not. Beginning the picture with a green "Princeton tiger" and Naval Academy grad attempting to woo a band singer before duty calls was a safe, stolid move, yet Wouk's story manages to cut much wider and deeper than the Hollywood generalities, and once his plot gets cooking the film is vastly entertaining. Humphrey Bogart is the new by-the-books captain aboard a Naval bottom-feeder, quickly driving his crew and his vessel into the ground with his idiosyncratic behavior. Dymtryk is careful while introducing all the different personalities aboard ship, and he doesn't want us to miss a trick, yet in the film's final stages (after the court martial, when defense attorney Jos√© Ferrer has his say), the tone of the picture does an about-face and hopes to show us all sides of the situation. The filmmakers want to have their cake and eat it too, and the resulting epilogue goes down like bad medicine. Still, the performances are first-rate, particularly by Bogart and, in perhaps his finest acting turn, Van Johnson. *** from ****</p>
