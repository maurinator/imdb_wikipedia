<h1>Journey to the Center of Time (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gruff, hard-nosed new boss Stanton takes over a scientific research company upon the death of his benevolent father. Scientists Manning, Gordon and White, who are very close to a breakthrough in time travel, are told by Stanton they must have results in 24 hours or face a funding cut-off. Trying to push their equipment past its safe operating limit they travel into the far future and distant past, with Stanton along as an accidental participant, unaware that a surprise awaits them as they struggle to return to the present.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the future all doors slide - this is a given fact of all SF movies from the days of Flash Gordon (possibly before that, it's a while since I've seen Metroplis) but this piece of junk goes one better than having the standard elevator sliding doors... the door of the "Time Vault" opens vertically as well as horizontally! it's the grooviest SF movie door since the The Monster from Morbius' Id came through the 'Krell metal' door in Forbidden Planet. I wonder where they stole it - because more time, effort, and invention went into making that door than into the whole of the rest of the movie put together and believe me it's the only reason to watch this really stupendously awful film.Having said all that I am giving it a 9 because it deserves more recognition as a classic bad SF film. It is up there with the Ed Woods. If you are in the mood for a masochistic do-it-yourself trepanning /lobotomy type movie then this is the one for you. It's great. I have drool coming from the corners of my mouth. Why do I do this to myself?</p>
