<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In a place where the sheriff is captain, the grocer is the marquee player, a high school senior who is the rising star of the team, and the town judge is the coach comes a hockey team from a small town on the outskirts of greatness. Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in "Mystery, Alaska." Full of hope, pride and determination, "Mystery, Alaska" will capture the hearts of the audience. A 13-year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers.Azaria comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor accepts the challenge to play the New York Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game. This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers? Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in "L.A. Confidential." Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to "Mystery, Alaska," as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe. Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in "Mystery Alaska." Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge/coach from Mystery.Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of "The Practice," "Ally McBeal", "Chicago Hope," "L.A. Law" and "Picket Fences," has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. "Mystery, Alaska" is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors.</p>
