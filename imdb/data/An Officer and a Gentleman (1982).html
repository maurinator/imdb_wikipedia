<h1>An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Zack Mayo is a young man who has signed up for Navy Aviation Officer Candidate School. He is a Navy brat who has a bad attitude problem. GySgt Foley is there to train and evaluate him and will clearly find Zack wanting. Zack meets Paula, a girl who has little beyond family and must decide what it is he wants to do with his life.</p>
<p>Zack Mayo grew up without much parental guidance following his mother's suicide when he was an adolescent. His naval seaman father, who was stationed in The Philippines at the time, became his official guardian, a role to which he admitted he did not want. As such, Zack grew up to be a loner and without a true sense of home or adult responsibility. Regardless, he, as a young man, decides to enlist in the navy to become a jet fighting officer, with the initial thirteen week training to take place at the air naval station on Whidbey Island, Washington. He plans on taking as easy a route possible through training, even if it means bending the rules and cutting corners. The drill instructor, Sergeant Emil Foley, seems to relish humiliating the recruits - especially Zack - with the ultimate goal of making them "DOR" aka drop on request. Despite being warned against who are known as the "Puget Debs" i.e. local girls who try to trap the officer candidates so that they can escape their drab factory lives, Zack and his best friend among the other officer candidates, Sid Worley, take up with two possible Puget Debs, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy respectively. Zack's experiences with Sgt. Foley are an obstacle to him making it through the thirteen weeks without DORing, but also make him come to an admission of why he wants to become an officer. And his experiences with Paula, Sid and Lynette provide him with some grounding as to what it means to be a grown up, despite Paula and Lynette's outward goal of becoming officer's wives by whatever means required.</p>
<p>Zack Mayo is a loner who has never had to rely on anyone but himself. As a child, he was sent to live with his father, a career Navy man based in the Philippines, after his mother commits suicide. There he soon realized that he had to be tough and rely on no one. After graduating from college, he shocks his father by telling that he has enlisted in the Navy and will enter training as a naval aviator. There he brings the same loner attitude he has had all of his life. He does however meet Paula, an attractive young woman who often attends base functions in the hope of nabbing a young officer and Sid Worley, a classmate with whom he forms a close bond. The training is difficult but not as tough as having to deal with their training officer, Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley who teaches Zack a lesson in the importance of relying on your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>A young man must complete his work at a Navy Flight school to become an aviator, with the help of a tough gunnery sergeant and his new girlfriend.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has to be Richard Gere's best movie and the one movie I felt he deserved an Oscar nomination for.  I read once that his role of Zach Mayo was first offered to John Denver.  It is impossible to think of anyone else in the role which is one indication of how good Gere was.      Lou Gossett, Jr. steals the show and gets a deserved Oscar as Gunnery Sergeant Foley.  Debra Winger is also delectable as Paula, Zach's working class girlfriend.       I had read that Winger had a real problem doing the nude scenes with Gere and felt very uncomfortable being undressed in front of the camera.  Supposedly the scene in which she is crying while making love to Zach isn't because she's feeling passion, it is because she is feeling humiliated.  The movie also had to snip out a couple of seconds of Winger flexing her hips a bit too much during a bed scene.  Still one of the steamiest bed scenes in film history.      The most riveting moment of the movie is when Foley is going to kick Zach out of the program and Gere frantically and desperately screams "DON'T YOU DO THAT!  I AIN'T GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!"  All of Zach's arrogance is drained out of him and he is just a desperate kid begging for the only chance he'll ever have.  Powerful moment.  In the end, Zach gains maturity.  Would you want to fly into combat with Zach Mayo or with Tom Cruise's Maverick in "Top Gun"?  Zach Mayo, hands down.</p>
