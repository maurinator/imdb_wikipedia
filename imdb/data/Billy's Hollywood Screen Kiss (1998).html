<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Aptly described by its producer as a trifle, this is a cheerful little romantic comedy about a gay photographer (SEAN HAYES) who fantasizes about what it would be like to connect with a gay hunk (BRAD ROWE) who seems to be leading him on in a homo-erotic relationship that Rowe prefers to keep platonic. The bedroom scene is the best acted, best scripted, best directed moment in the whole film, done with rare sensitivity and acting skill by both. It culminates in nothing, which is what one feels by the time the movie has come to its disappointing finale. Nothing really new has opened up food for thought.By turns, sad, wistful, funny, irreverent, with a cast full of what we call misfits (and rather shallow ones at that), it fails to do anything more than pass the time as the kind of interesting little gay trifle that gains sympathy for Sean Hayes' character. At the same time one can't help being irritated by his hopelessly romantic character molded by the tacky romantic films he grew up on. Makes its point by having strains from Max Steiner's "Now, Voyager" as part of the background score.Certainly not for everyone, but amusing enough to please fans of SEAN HAYES who will no doubt like seeing him in a more restrained role than the gay man he played on "Will and Grace". He does well in the part. BRAD ROWE is a bit stiff as his fair-haired dreamboy (and would-be lover), lacking the ability to create any sympathy at all for his character by the film's end. He's really too bland to care about.Darkly handsome JASON-SHANE SCOTT as Brad might have been a better choice for Rowe's key role since he shows considerable more dramatic ability in a minor part as well as the model looks required.</p>
