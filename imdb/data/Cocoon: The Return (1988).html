<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sequels are usually not as good as the original, unless the sequel happens to be called "Godfather II," so "Cocoon: The Return" is no exception. On the other hand, I didn't find it ghastly (though a few others on this board did). It has the same terrific cast, which includes Don Ameche, Jack Gilford, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, with the addition of Elaine Strich in the old folks' department, and Tawnee Welch, Tyrone Power Jr., and Steve Guttenberg with the addition of a very young Courtney Cox in the young folks' department. Brian Dennehy makes a brief appearance at the end of the film.The Anterians need to return to pick up some cocoons, so the old folks come back to catch up with friends and family, with some interesting results.Another plot concerns scientists taking one of the cocoons and studying it, while the Anterians attempt to rescue it before it's too late.The movie actually has some very sweet moments - it probably would have been lousy without the same cast, but they're all very likable.Okay, not great, and anyone under 55 probably won't want to be bothered. By the way, I cried during some of it. Guess my age.</p>
