<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Set in late 1800's Britain, "Jude" traces the life of the title character (Eccleston),  a learned but humble stonemason, who courageously struggles with life's disappointments only to be struck with unspeakable tragedy. A beautifully depressing human drama, "Jude" traverses the highs and lows of life through its dreary tale of one man's steadfast conviction to his beliefs and to the woman he loves. Not for everyone, "Jude" is a film for realists into serious drama which many will likely regard as a "downer".  (B+)</p>
