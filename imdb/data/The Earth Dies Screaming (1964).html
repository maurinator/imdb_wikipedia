<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This 1964 film is very good, one of the best ones I've seen. The story wasn't confusing or stupid, although it is typical to films made during this time. It's too bad that the print I've seen was somewhat grainy and blurry. I believe there is a better print out there, because this movie shouldn't be wasted, it has too much to offer.</p>
