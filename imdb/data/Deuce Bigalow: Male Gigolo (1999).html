<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has to be the greatest movie of Rob Schneider's career. Everything else that he has done has been crap crap crap.I like this movie. It finally is a different type of movie. Gigolo Comedy is what I call it. When they made Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo it sucked, but this one it much better.I caught this on regular television towards the end of the middle, then I decided to rent it and give it a try. It was funny.The part when he is dancing on the pole is priceless. Rob Schneider is funny but this has to be his best work. He didn't even do that You Can Do It thing.</p>
