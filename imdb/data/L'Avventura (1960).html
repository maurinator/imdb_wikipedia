<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of rich Italians head out on a yachting trip to a deserted volcanic island in the Mediterranean. When they are about to leave the island, they find Anna, the main character up to this point, has gone missing. Sandro, Anna's boyfriend, and Claudia, Anna's friend, try without success to find her. While looking for the missing friend, Claudia and Sandro develop an attraction for each other. When they get back to land, they continue the search with no success. Sandro and Claudia proceed to become lovers, and all but forget about the missing Anna.</p>
<p>The wealthy Anna is not sure about her feelings with her lover Sandro. While in a yacht trip with her upper class friends including her best friend Claudia in the Sicily coast, the group decides to visit a desert volcanic island. When the weather changes and they have to leave the island, they note that Anna has vanished. Claudia, Sandro and another friend stay in the island during the night trying to find Anna, while the rest of the group returns. On the next morning, they bring the coast guard and Anna is not found. Along the next days, Sandro and Claudia search Anna in the most different places in Italy and develop an attraction for each other, becoming lovers.</p>
<p>One summery Saturday afternoon a group of friends living in Rome departs on a yachting trip out to a local island. Two of the group, Anna (Lea Massari) and Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), young lovers considering marriage, have a dispute; that afternoon, Sandro announces that Anna is missing. A thorough search of the island is made on Anna's behalf, but she is never found, and Sandro, who remains relatively unconcerned, is never questioned. In fact, before the yachting group even returns to the mainland, Sandro tries to pick up Anna's best friend, Claudia (Monica Vitti). Still, he is not even considered suspicious. Claudia and Sandro galavant through the Italian countryside, supposedly investigating Claudia's disappearance, but their true motives are never clear, even in the last--entirely enigmatic--scene of the movie.</p>
<p>A woman disappears during a Mediterranean boating trip. During the search, her lover and her best friend become attracted to each other.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I know, I know, I just didn't "get" it. That's always the line of apologists for movies that lie there like 3 day old fish. I don't fall for it myself.The movie is great to look at, and there are some good performances and interesting sequences, but it doesn't add up to a good movie.Problem numero uno--it's a movie about bored people which does not completely avoid the trap of being dull as a consequence.Problem numero due--the people are conflicted and restless and troubled, but almost totally unable to convey their thoughts or feelings. This comes to have the effect of severing the viewer's interest in said people. Claudia remains the most interesting because she is really the only person who seems alive and responsive to the moment, but she is not enough to make the movie a good one.Problem numero tre--there is no there there. Every positive review I have seen of this film involves the reviewer bringing most of the refreshments to the party, then saying it is a great celebration. It's nice to be delighted with one's own cleverness in "helping" a movie by filling in all the many missing elements, but that's no reason to tell other people it's a great movie. It is not all up there on the screen. I am not averse to bringing my participation to the movie experience, but I don't expect a movie to be like MadLibs in which I am expected to supply all the verbs.So, a much anticipated "classic" that disappoints; that's my review.</p>
