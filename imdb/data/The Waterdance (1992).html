<h1>The Waterdance (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A film about struggling to deal with paralysis. Author Joel Garcia breaks his neck while hiking, and finds himself in a rehabilitation centre with Raymond, an exaggerating ladies' man, and Bloss, a racist biker. Considerable tension builds as each character tries to deal with his new found handicap and the problems that go with it, especially Joel, whose lover Anna is having as difficult a time as he is. As Raymond reveals a dream about dancing on the surface of a lake to stay afloat, it becomes apparent that each of them must find his own Waterdance to survive his tragedy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I flipped by this movie on late night cable and was compelled to watch it.  It was about 1:00 am on a work night but I could not bring myself to turn off the TV and go to bed (I am so glad I did not.)  I would have to rank this movie in my personal top 5.  In spite of its obvious low budget, the story line and the actors/actresses portrayals of their characters is outstanding.  I was deeply moved by the compassion of Hunt's character. It is a shame that this movie was released in '92 as it could well be a Box Office smash with today's media promotion.  2 Thumbs to the cast and crew of this masterpiece.</p>
