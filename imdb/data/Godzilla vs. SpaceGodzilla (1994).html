<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hosnestly, I'm not entirely sure why some people are hating this movie. There are a few parts to nitpick, but I don't officially mind. Without a doubt, this is one of the best installments in the Godzilla series. It's a film that shakes the foundations of the very cosmos.G-Force, a military organization that basically studies Godzilla in order to find solutions for dealing with the monster, has developed two special programs: Project T (using a sort of mind control device made to keep Godzilla under control) and Project M (building MOGUERA, who first appeared in the "Mysterians", to combat Godzilla). However, a new menace has arrived from space to take over the world and kill the King of the Monsters: Spacegodzilla. With the help of MOGUERA, Godzilla decides to free his now imprisoned son and save the world from his cosmic clone.A cool story is backed up by some familiar human characters, flashy effects, and awesome fight scenes. Miki Saegusa, the telepath that sympathizes with Godzilla, returns in what is probably her biggest role in the Hensei series, supporting the Monster King every step of the way. The fights between Godzilla and MOGUERA against Spacegodzilla are absolutely epic. They just beat the living crap out of each other as they destroy everything in sight. The music is also to be commended. Spacegodzilla is really powerful and his theme music helps emphasize how menacing he is.It deserves more credit than it gets for what it is: an epic Godzilla film. Worth the watch, so check it out.</p>
