<h1>Z.P.G. (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the not too distant future, a very smoggy and overpopulated Earth government makes it illegal to have children for a generation. One couple, unsatisfied with their substitute robot baby, breaks the rules and gets in a lot of trouble. (Z.P.G. stands for Zero Population Growth.)</p>
<p>Centuries into the future, the world is overpopulated and polluted and on the verge of collapse. The governments of the world are desperate and so make the painful decision to ban the birth of babies for 30 years. Brainwashing and robot substitutes are used to quell the yearning for children with the death penalty as the ultimate deterrent. Despite this, one couple have a baby.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I bought this film from a secondhand videoshop I was amazed by the quality of this movie. The use of cameras, music and plot were wery artistic. Twisted utopia genre is allways interesting (like Zardoz), and this movie is no exeption. This movie is a must see 70's scifi gem.</p>
