<h1>In Celebration (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a Yorkshire mining town, three educated brothers return to their blue-collar home to celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary of their parents, but dark secrets come to the fore.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The great Lindsay Anderson adapts another play for film.Quite interesting, well acted (a then quite young Alan Bates, Brian Cox, Bill Owen among others) study of dysfunctional working class English family where the three sons have become educated and moved up in the world, but are still stuck in the wounds of their childhood. The production still feels very stagy, and some of the writing is too theatrical for film, but much of the play is moving and nicely complex; finding ways to combine the personal and the political. It does feel a bit dated -- from a time when breaking away from living the life your parents expected was still a more radical idea.</p>
