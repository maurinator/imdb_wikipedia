<h1>Superman (1979)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Superman legend continues in this game where you fly around as Superman trying to catch Lex Luthor and his gang of thugs.  It had interesting action (flying, x-ray vision, Kryptonite) but was very limited by Atari's available memory, therefore it was not graphically attractive.This was was not your typical video game for a few reasons:1)  It was timed.  The better you got at it, the LESS time it took you to play it.  This made it more attractive to people that didn't want to spend hours to improve their high scores.  It actually made it more sociable with friends since you could switch off every ten minutes or so.2)  It was a non-violent crime game.  Probably the last of it's breed in this regard.  You weren't shooting someone or something, you were just trying to round up the bad guys as fast as you can.The one thing I hated (as a 12 or 13 year old boy) was the fact that if Superman was stricken by kryptonite, he had to WALK around aimlessly until he kissed Lois Lane.</p>
