<h1>Elvira's Haunted Hills (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set back in 1851 in the Carpathia Mountains of Romania, Elvira the Mistress of the Dark" en route to Paris with her maidservant Zou Zou for a can-can revue, stop for the night at a haunted castle owned by a certain Vladimir Hellsubus whose long dead wife bears an eerie resemblance to Elvira.</p>
<p>The setting is Carpathia. The year is 1851. When Elvira gets kicked out of an Inn for a slight monetary discrepancy, she is rescued by a local who takes her to stay at the castle in the hills high above the village. The fact that she happens to resemble the count's former "missing" wife opens a can of worms or two.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just bought the DVD of Elvira's Haunted Hills today. Elvira's one of my favorite horror hosts (her and Svengoolie). We sure did wait a long time for this movie, and I'm glad to see it finally got made. Some of the sets in this film were really first-rate, and the hokey one-liners can still crack anyone up. The DVD transfer was very good, both sound & video.  There are lots of cool extras on the disc too, including "The Making Of Elvira's Haunted Hills" featurette; Interview with co-star Richard O'Brien and the Original theatrical trailer. Elvira's Haunted Hills is a lot of fun - you'll enjoy this movie!</p>
