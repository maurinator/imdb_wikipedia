<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I enjoyed this movie far more than I thought I would. Both male leads give good performances (I never doubted they were really friends, which is rare in a movie) and there were many funny moments, a lot of which came from Bonnie Hunt.  The only character that seemed underdeveloped and forced was Natasha - Jason Lee's ex.  Their scenes together didn't do much for the movie.</p>
