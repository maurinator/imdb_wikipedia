<h1>To Walk with Lions (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>George Adamson fights to save Kenya's wildlife. Together with his young assistant Tony Fitzjohn, Adamson battles to keep the animals on his game reserve "Kora" from dangerous poachers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Richard Harris gives a brilliant performance as George Adamson,  the leader of an African Lion Preserve. Battling poachers and the threat of losing his land, Adamson maintains his mystical relationship with his Lions in his efforts to retrain these orphans to survive in the wild.  There is no doubt that Harris is the much older Adamson, the teacher and student of these magnificent animals.The acting is great. The storyline follows all too familiar relationships between the men and women and are quite predictable. Despite that I highly recommend this film.</p>
