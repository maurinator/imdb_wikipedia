<p>Chantel Mitchell (Ariyan Johnson), a hip, articulate, black high-school girl in Brooklyn, is determined not to become "just another girl on the IRT" (the IRT is one of NYC's subway lines).In the early 1990s, if you wanted to see a group of kids and some scary stuff, you probably watched "Kids". Now, that remains a scary film, but this is just as good. nay, it is probably better. It addresses AIDS, pregnancy, racism... even the geography of Africa. And it does it in a way that is not heavy-handed and will not scare off white folks who dislike "black movies".If you grew up in the era of TLC and Salt 'n Pepa, this is the film equivalent of those songs. Well worth seeing. There is more independent film out there than Jim Jarmusch and Richard Linklater.</p>
