<h1>Play It Again, Sam (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>In San Francisco, the neurotic, awkward and clumsy film critic Allan that is a fan of "Casablanca" is left by his wife Nancy that is tired of their boring life. His friends Linda and her husband Dick try to help him finding available acquaintances to date him. Allan is advised by his alter ego Bogart how to behave with women, but Allan is too weird and the women never go in a second date with him. Soon Allan finds that he is in love with Linda, but Dick is his best friend and he does not want to make a move despite Bogart advices.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perhaps Woody's best effort in his 'neurotic schlep' persona. The script is a comic whirlwind, with too many brilliant scenes to enumerate (I can't resist mentioning the blind date's arrival - the desperate preparations and the pathetic introduction are funny but painful, in that we have all been in that position; his demonstration of authentic Chinese rice-eating technique is another classic). The device of the imaginary Bogart alter ego works well, especially in the climactic scene with Diane Keaton. In my book this ranks with Sleeper, Manhattan, and Annie Hall as Woody's best films.</p>
