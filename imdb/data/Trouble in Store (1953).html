<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When a major London department store is taken over by a new manager, Mr Freeman, stock boy Norman finds himself out of a job after a series of misunderstandings.  He wins back his job in time to get embroiled in an internal robbery of the store.This was the first of the Norman Wisdom/Rank comedies that became an annual money spinner from the 50's well into the 1960's.  The plot is rarely important and here we have a mix of romance and robbery that supports the usual mix of accidents and misunderstandings.  The romance and the robbery don't really work, the romance seems to happen far too quickly while the robbery is tacked on at the end.Wisdom is as excellent as always - his uncoordinated, shy, eager, accident prone and misunderstood personality allows him to have a series of funny set pieces.  It's an acquired taste, but if you like the short of slapstick humour then Wisdom will appeal to you.  Wisdom regular Jerry Desmonde is good as the store manager and Margaret Rutherford (second in the cast list for a very small role) is funny as an upper-class shop lifter.  The only weak link is Lister as Norman's love interest, she's a little light and her character changes depending on how the story is going.Overall it's not a masterpiece but it's a good Norman Wisdom comedy.  It won't appeal to everyone but it's a gentle family comedy from another age.</p>
