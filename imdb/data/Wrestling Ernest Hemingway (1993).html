<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie, and the critic's plot summary doesn't come close to helping you decide whether or not to watch it.  It's NOT a tear jerker either. With this cast you're obviously not watching any rookies or male actors lost in their macho.  Every character in this movie is played superbly, and becomes so real, that you can't help but feel like you are right in the middle of a slice of life in a little town on the coast of Florida.Robert Duval (Walter) is a retired Cuban gentleman, Richard Harris (Frank) is a lonely, crusty retired sailor.  Each lives alone, without any family around. They meet in the park at Franks' unwelcome prompting, and with some real reluctance on Walter's part.  Shirley McClaine (Coonie) is the divorced motel landlord where Frank lives, and they go toe to toe over one issue after another, occasionally over a little Irish whiskey, including whether or not she'll let Frank get his hands on her.  Sandra Bullock (Elaine) is Walter's favorite waitress at the Sweetwater Cafe, and they exchange fond jabs each time he comes around.  Piper Lorie is a self respecting single lady, on whom Frank clumsily works his flawed romanatic magic in their town's only movie house.At the center of this light drama is the unlikely and rocky friendship developing between Frank and Walter.  With the backdrop of a laid back little coastal town, and moving to wonderful cuban music and rhythms, each one of the characters and relationships unfolds a little at a time, and begin to cross over one another.  Just as you get to know people in your life a little at a time, these folks become more and more themselves as the story unfolds.The timing, setting, filming, music, and subtleties of the characters and the script work beautifully so that you fall right into it all.The ending is tender, wistful, and the characters just seem to go their own way. This is like that book you read, where halfway through you started dreading the last few pages.</p>
