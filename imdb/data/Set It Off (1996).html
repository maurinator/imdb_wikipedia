<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented this movie expecting to see just another average gang related film about the Ghetto, but I was proved wrong.  It ended with my eyes wide opened and my mouth to the floor.  Set It Off is a very Dramatic film and the performances by the four women were done perfectly.  Set It Off reached my heart and all my emotions.  It starts off light, but ends deep and touching.  There is no possible way you could leave from watching this movie without your eyes being flooded.  -A heart-filled film that deserved more publicity than it received.</p>
