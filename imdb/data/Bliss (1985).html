<h1>Bliss (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An advertising executive dies and goes to hell... except nothing changes. Well, his daughter is buying drugs with sexual favours from her brother, and the number of cancer-causing products is on the increase. But the notes he writes to himself to prove he hasn't gone insane are getting more disjointed, and he runs off with an ex-prostitute called Honey Barbera.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Ray Lawrence, the director of "Bliss," and Paul Murphy, its cinematographer, were both first-time feature filmmakers when they made "Bliss."  I believe the movie swept the Australian "Oscars" in '85, and in my humble opinion, deservedly so.The tone is somewhat dark, the genre surrealist comedy, the performances deliciously eccentric, and the storytelling masterful.  "Bliss" reminds me more of some of my favorite novels than it does any other films.  Peter Carey's novel and adaptation have some of the feeling of John Irving's earlier works, but it's not derivative.  The cinematography is gorgeous and understated.  It has a surprisingly romantic core beneath a fairly jaded surface, which I think is a tough combination to pull off.It isn't appropriate for kids (it has sophisticated, adult themes and, at moments, a very frank approach to sex) and it has an unexpectedly epic, languorous feel toward the end (so don't watch it when you're sleepy), but if you're serious about appreciating movies, you owe it to yourself to give this one a chance.  Enjoy!</p>
