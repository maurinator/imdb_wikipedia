<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay, I'll admit that I was a kid when I first saw this so this review is done wearing rose-colored glasses.  But having seen this '76 remake of "King Kong", my opinion hasn't changed much: it's still great!  Maybe not the equal of the original, but how could it be?  It does well enough in its own behalf.The music grabs you right off: John Barry did aces with his pounding, dramatic score.  And you couldn't ask for a better cast; Lange does okay for a first role, Bridges makes linear-thought acting look easy and Grodin is about as slimy a baddie as you could ask for.  The bit parts are also filled with familiar faces (Bernsen, Piscopo, Auberjoinois, Lauter, Randolph and Lone) who acquit themselves quite well.A lot of people blast the monkey suit.  But I think Rick Baker did a good job with it.  Of COURSE it's a guy in a monkey suit, but it's a guy in a WELL-DONE monkey suit.  It still gets me when Kong blew-dry Dwan (Lange after her waterfall shower); those puffed-out cheeks, especially in 1976, were high tech enough for me (remember, this was before "Star Wars" came out).But we all know how the story works; any of us who have a rudimentary knowledge of the original, that is.  The new twist was having the emotional connection between Lange and ape.  More enlightened than having her scream endlessly.  The Twin Towers scene near the end was not only exciting but quietly moving, as it showed just how much the beast cared for his beauty.There's plenty of corn in this one, no argument, but it's corn for a good cause.  I loved "King Kong" and if I had a chance, I'd buy a copy!  Anyone have John Guillermin's phone number?Seven stars for "Kong"; long live the "King"!</p>
