<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A bombardier in World War II tries desperately to escape the insanity of the war. However, sometimes insanity is the only sane way cope with a crazy situation. Catch-22 is a parody of a "military mentality" and of a bureaucratic society in general.</p>
<p>Durante la seconda guerra mondiale il capitano dell'aviazione Americana Yossarian, nel timore di perdere la vita in una missione aerea, cerca di farsi passare per pazzo per farsi esonerare, ma non vi riesce. Mentre aspetta che la sua domanda venga accolta, assiste impotente alle tante situazioni assurde che la guerra si porta dietro: inutili massacri, ordini disumani e privi di logica, obbedienza cieca, profitti economici dei guerrafondai. Esasperato e disgustato, Yossarian decide alla fine di fuggire dalla base area nella quale presta servizio, partendo a bordo di un canotto verso il mare aperto.</p>
<p>Yossarian is a bombadier during World War II. He desperately tries to be declared insane by the Air Force in order to go home. However during the process he slowly watches each of his friends and crew die off in the horrors of war.</p>
<p>A man is trying desperately to be certified insane during World War II, so he can stop flying missions.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>CATCH-22 was filmed using a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (an image almost two-and-a-half times wider than it is high). Every inch of the picture area was used by the cinematographer for important information. If you watch the horrible, cropped pan-and-scan version, which is all you can get on either VHS or Laser Disc, you are missing close to 40% of the intended picture area and a great deal of important stuff! I've seen this desecrated version and, be warned, you will not even understand the final flashback revelation because it is not even in the frame!! People who can't stand those "black bars" on the top and bottom of the screen are going to miss the entire point of this movie!! Rent or buy the DVD, which is widescreen and restores all this critical image area. Do not judge this film if you can't see it all. I have to wonder how many of the previous reviews here are based upon the unbelievably butchered VHS version.</p>
