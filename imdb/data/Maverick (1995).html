<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Narrated by Alec Baldwin, this documentary from 1995 describes the life of Hollywood director William Wellman. Included are anecdotes by all his stars (check out that the cast list... he sure worked with them all!) As Wellman had died in 1975, the stories of his childhood, war record, and Hollywood days are told by his family, friends, and the stars of his films. Quite well done. A bit on the serious side, there is a lighter side to it as people describe Wellman's fiery, take- no-prisoners attitude toward his bosses and anyone who got in his way. Directed by Todd Robinson, who had done a mix of TV and films prior to this. They spend a lot of time discussing the silent film "Wings" (1927), which was important for several reasons - the first Oscar given for Best Picture, it starred Buddy Rogers, Gary Cooper, Clara Bow, and Richard Arlen. What a collection of stars! It even showed one of the first on-screen kiss-on-the-lips between two soldiers, as one of them lay dying. We hear part of the story of finding his fourth wife Dorothy, who, 20 years younger than Wellman, had been a chorus girl prior to meeting him. Also interesting to note Wellman wrote and directed the first version of "A Star is Born" in 1937. It must have been good stuff... they have made two more versions of it, so far.</p>
