<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Correct rendition of the most famous mystery novel written by Arthur Conan Doyle with an awesome Peter Cushing as Sherlock and fairly faithful to the source material. Holmes (Peter Cushing )and Watson(Andre Morell) are contracted by Doctor Mortimer (Francis De Wolff) for the investigation of killing Sr. Baskerville who is now inherited by his niece Sir Henry . Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to help protect Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee), who has returned to England to take his place at the family seat following the death of his uncle, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died of cardiac exhaustion and Dr. Mortimer believes he was frightened to death. There appears to be a curse on the family dating back nearly 200 years to when Sir Hugo Baskerville was supposedly killed on the moor by a huge hound. Holmes dismisses the supernatural elements of the case but there are a sufficient number of odd events to pique his interest. Holmes soon realizes that someone is making sure the legend becomes real . Watson goes to the mansion ,there are the servants(John Le Mesurier) and he meets Stapleton and his daughter (Marla Landi). Meanwhile an inmate has escaped and on the moor sound the barking of a savage beast.This is an excellent and thrilling film with horror elements in Hammer style based on the splendid novel by Arthur Conan Doyle .It's a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense and moody intrigue . The film gets mystery, tension, thrills , detective action and packs an exciting deal of outstanding surprises with great lots of fun despite to be a known story . Magnificent Peter Cushing's interpretation although the best Sherlock is forever Basil Rathbone. Cushing plays as Holmes as an intelligent, obstinate, broody, pipesmoking sleuth , his acting is similar to Jeremy Brett for TV or Nicol Williamson(Seven-per-cent-solution) or Christopher Plummer(Murder by decree). Here Dr. Watson isn't a botcher, bungler or clumsy partner incarnated by Nigel Bruce but a cunning and astute pal well represented by Andre' Morell .The movie has a creepy atmosphere specially when is developed on the moor where lives the fearful giant beast ; besides the 223 Baker Street's house is well designed. Spooky and murky cinematography by Jack Asher . Eerie and creepy musical score by James Bernard . This atmospheric motion picture is accurately directed by the ¨Hammer House of Horror¨ master , the great Terence Fisher . Other version about this story are the following : the best version that still can be called a classic filmed in 1939 by Sidney Landfield with Basil Rathbone , Nigel Bruce y Richard Greene ; English adaptation (1983) by Douglas Hickox with Ian Richardson as Holmes and Donald Churchill as Watson and TV rendition with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke . directed by Peter Hammond .</p>
