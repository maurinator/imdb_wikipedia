<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought that the characters were really neat and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show all have great personalities. in My opinion these characters are some of the best ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion action packed which that is what makes the show good. There are so many characters to like If you like the other classic 1980s' animated cartoons like The GoBots, M.A.S.K., Transformers, C.O.P.S. and many others then I strongly recommend that you watch this show!</p>
