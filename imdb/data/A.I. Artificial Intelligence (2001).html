<h1>A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the not-so-far future the polar ice caps have melted and the resulting rise of the ocean waters has drowned all the coastal cities of the world. Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his "mother", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.</p>
<p>In the futuristic tale, a highly advanced robotic boy named David is 11 years old. He weighs 60 pounds. He is 4 feet, 6 inches tall. He has brown hair. His love is real. But he is not. He is a marvel of cybernetic progress who really only wants to be a real boy, loved by his mother and his father in that happy place called home. But David journeys out into the forests to find a way to become a real boy.</p>
<p>In this futuristic fairy tale, "David", a highly-advanced robotic boy, hopes to become a real boy so that he can win back the affection of the human mother who abandoned him. Like Pinocchio, he goes on a long journey hoping to find his "Blue Fairy," who can make his dreams come true.</p>
<p>In the future, artificial intelligence has involved in such a way that a family can now accept a near to life like child. This is exactly what the Swinton family does, but when things get worse for the relationship between the family and this new child, they send it out to survive on its own. With only the name David and a passion to become a real boy, the child becomes friends with Gigolo Joe and sets off to make it become a reality.</p>
<p>A highly advanced robotic boy longs to become "real" so that he can regain the love of his human mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought A.I. was a very good film.  I'm sure it is somewhat different from what Kubrick had thought but he and Spielberg had worked on it for a long time. I liked the questions that it posed about such as what does it mean to be a being?  Does the boy robot have genuine feelings or are they programmed?  But we as people do we have genuine feelings or are they "programmed" in our genetic code, by society, and by other factors?  Intriguing questions from an intriguing film.  Definitely a thinking persons movie. The acting by Haley Joel Osmet was outstanding and the supporting cast was equally good, too.  The portrayal of the future was somewhat frightening but also extremely fascinating.  Especially the ending of the film.  I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was "Wow!"  He only expresses that for films he really likes.  Those who like science fiction and those who like films that make them think definitely see this film.  Even if you are not as impressed as I am you will find parts of the film fascinating.</p>
