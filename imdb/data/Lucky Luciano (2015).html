<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Charles "Lucky" Luciano arrives in New York City, teaming with Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel, in the opener of this docudrama chronicling the roots of organized crime in America.My first question: does it give too much credit to Luciano? I think so, definitely seeming to accept the idea of how the Commission was formed, which seems less than verified. And when referring to him as a child, they call him "Charles Luciano" rather than "Salvatore Lucania".It is great they got into heroin, and early on debunked the myth that the Mafia stayed out of drugs. As shown here, they were in narcotics from the very beginning, and in fact it was the Bureau of Narcotics that had spent the most time tracking them, rather than the FBI.I would like to have seen more from Alex Hortis. I know he is a newer face on the scene, but I am sure he is more knowledgeable than an actor from "The Sopranos". Hopefully there is more Hortis in future episodes.</p>
