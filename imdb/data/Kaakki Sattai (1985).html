<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Now, this is a movie which has been taken for hardcore masala fans. U got to see this film without logical type of questions. Released in a period when such type of movies ruled tamil film industry.The thing to be praised and highlighted in this movie, is again the quality. I've mentioned in the review to 'Vikram' about this factor present in Kamal films only during that period (Although, very rare films like 'Oomai vizhigal' too featured this factor). U can take any film in which Kamal has acted and u'll agree with me .Here too, Sathyaraj has donned the role of the Villain. He has handled the role with such an ease that it's he who gets full marks ahead of Kamal in the scenes which feature them both. I mean, who can forget the immortal dialogue, 'Thagadu Thagadu' ! ! ! He has such a gift in him which he has excellently used when he acted as a villain ! ! The heroine is Ambika and has done quite a decent piece of acting. Madhavi comes for some scenes and a song and goes away.Again, Ilayaraja has composed some superb songs in this movie too. 'Kanmaniye pesu' stands as a soothing melody whereas 'Pattu kannam' and ' vaanile thenila' are peppy numbers. 'Poo potta dhavani' is a good club song (Which was also a must in Kamal & Rajni movies at that time). Of late, my favorite song has been 'Singari Sarakku' . I love that song very much and hear it frequently ! ! Rajasekar has directed this movie and once again has proved that he is the best for such movies. Even though the story is very small, the screenplay makes this film an interesting one.Totally, a complete masala fun filled entertainer from the trio of Kamal, Rajasekar and Ilayaraja ! !</p>
