<h1>Tea and Sympathy (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tom Lee is a sensitive boy of 17 whose lack of interest in the "manly" pursuits of sports, mountain climbing and girls labels him "sister-boy" at the college he is attending. Head master Bill Reynold's wife Laura sees Tom's suffering at the hands of his school mates (and her husband), and tries to help him find himself.</p>
<p>At his ten year reunion, Tom Lee reminisces about his life at Chilton, a boys' prep school. Chilton is the type of institution where generations from the same family attend, and want to attend. Tom, however, has different thoughts. He was perceived as different than the other boys, who called him sister-boy. He doesn't join in the group sporting activities except tennis, a sport he plays with finesse rather than power; he knows how to sew and cook; he knows all about gardening; he wants to be a folk musician; he's only accepted into the dramatic club if he plays the women's roles; and he even doesn't walk or style his hair like the others. The only one of his classmates who tries to understand him is his roommate, Al Thompson, who feels he can only do so much as one person against the masses. Tom knows that he embarrasses his alumnus father, Herb Lee, who is worried the Lee name will now be forever tainted at Chilton. At Chilton, Tom's favorite times are spent with Laura Reynolds, the relatively recent bride of his dormitory house master, the overtly masculine Bill Reynolds who also attended Chilton as a student at the same time as Herb Lee. Seeing the torment he is facing from all sides, Laura wants to help Tom in any way she can. As time goes on and things don't get any better for Tom, Laura comes to the realization of why she is trying so desperately to help him and what she needs to do both to accomplish that task and be true to herself.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Deborah Kerr has always been one of the best actresses. Her beauty and wit have always gotten her pretty well rounded roles. "Tea and Sympathy" has done something else for her...It has made her a real human that we can all identify with and understand. She captured your attention with her every second on the screen. John Kerr, as Tom Lee, (the main character) is simply in the backdrop, carrying the story along as best he can. Within him we see a ridiculed boy whose over-femininity makes him the joke of his school. Even the teachers seem to gang up on him. Known as "Sister-boy Lee" he tries to 'become' a man, only to let himself down further. He is soon pitied and taken in by Laura Reynolds, the school master's wife, who is told to "Stay out" because she's not really "involved". The truth is she is deeply involved...Her husband is the main reason for this kid's pain. I don't want to spoil the ending for you so I will say this...Vincente Minnelli is a brilliant director. Deborah Kerr is a wonderful actress who's inner beauty matches her physical beauty. John Kerr really shines. This movie is worth seeing. It does skirt the topic of homophobia but it tells the story that we (when we were teens) can all tell, trying to accept who we are and not trying to be what we aren't.</p>
