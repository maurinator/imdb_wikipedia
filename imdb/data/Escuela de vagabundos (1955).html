<h2> Summaries </h2>

While looking for help, he finds the Valverdes' house and is welcome by Emilia, the mother of the family, who is known for giving shelter to tramps. The rest of the family disagrees, because the last one disappointed her. In a story of family situations, funny moments and jealousy, Alberto ends up earning everyone's respect and has a special connection with the oldest daughter, the beautiful Susana, and they fall in love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I would like to say that this is one of the best films of Pedro Infante and probably one of the best of Mexican film industry. Pure comedy. The jokes are very natural and ordinary, the conversations among the characters are funny without being silly and boring.It´s fair to say that all the performances are brilliant, as the film is full of stars. The beauty of Miroslava and two of the most handsome men, Infante and Casanova. Blanca de Castrejon and Anabel Gutierrez (she was only 17!!!) funny as ever, and the experience of two great comedy actors: Oscar Pulido and Oscar Ortiz de Pinedo.You have to see this movie, wherever you live. And if you´re a Pedro Infante fan, I´m sure you know what I´m talking about.</p>
