<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Delivering Milo is a fantastic journey into the world that humans are unsure evens exists. What would happen if a soul refused to be born?  It does get your mind turning.  Granted, the plotline that the entire human race will die out is a bit tacky, but the idea is the important factor.I personally found it wonderfully refreshing in the way the writers(David Hubbard, and Diana Wagman) criss-crossed the different character's plotlines; however, the connections could be easily seen through hints scattered throughout.  The characters did seem a little slow on the draw, but what can you do.I have to disagree with previous comments on the issue of blatantness.  The plot turns were, for the most part, unexpected.  Albert Finney also fills his roll as a high life gambler well.  In all Delivering Milo is a good movie.</p>
