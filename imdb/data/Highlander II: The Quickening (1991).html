<h1>Highlander II: The Quickening (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The second "Highlander" movie, again with Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery. It's the year 2024 and all the ozone above Earth has gone. To protect people from dying, MacLeod helped in the construction of a giant "shield", several years ago. But, since there isn't left anyone Immortal after MacLeod's victory in the previous film, he has stopped being an Immortal himself. Now he is just an old man, until one day some other Immortals arrive on our planet. You see, the Immortals come from another planet...</p>
<p>Connor Macleod and Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez return in this all action sequel to 1985's Highlander. The year is 2024, and MacLeod is now a mortal old man. However the world has become a very dead planet since the creation of "the shield", an artifical ozone layer - which MacLeod supervised construction of. It turns out that MacLeod was banished from a distant past with his mentor Ramirez. MacLeod's old nemesis from the past (General Katana) travels into the future to kill Connor once an for all. MacLeod calls upon the spirit of Ramirez to help him defeat Katana, before Katana kills him. MacLeod is also aided by Louise Marcus, an environmental activist that believes the ozone layer as repaired itself and "the shield" is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>In the future, Highlander Connor MacLeod must prevent the destruction of Earth under an anti-ozone shield.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In 1999, I was graduating college in Richmond, Virginia and had a yard sale to get rid of excess junk.  I had quite a collection of movies on VHS that I hoped to get rid of because DVD was just coming into its own.  I had a copy of "Highlander II Renegade Version" that I bought in th 4.99 clearance bin at Wal-Mart because I had seen "Highlander II: The Quickening" and wondering if there was any way possible in improve on one of the worst films I had ever seen.Well, renegade version started out priced 2.00 in the morning.  By lunchtime, it was down to a buck.  As the afternoon wore on, the price went down... 75 cents, 50 cents, 25 cents.  Finally, I had sold most of my films and decided to give it away for free.  As the sun began to set and I cleaned up, this film was still there.  It seems you cannot even give it away for free!Anyway, if you're a glutton for punishment, this is the film for you.  It has "low budget" written all over it, and I, for one, cannot possible fathom how Sean Connery agreed to be in it.  "This movie is awesome and fearless in its badness" Roger Ebert writes, and for once, I agree with him.  It is pretty bad.  It creates massive continuity errors with the first Highlander by having all the immortals come from the planet Zeist (!?!).  Second, as a plot device, the sky is covered with some kind of orange/red crud to protect the earth, which has lost the ozone layer.   Wouldn't everything on Earth die without any kind of sunlight anyway, since the sun is the source of energy for all the forms of life at the bottom of the food chain?The renegade version is even more unwatchable than this version! You might ask yourself, how is that possible considering that Highlander II is one of the worst films ever made.  Well, somehow they found a way.  Now if they could only put all that energy into cancer research, cancer would be wiped out!I could go on and on just how and why this movie is so stupid, but what would be the point?  Chances are, if you're reading this review, you're some kind of Highlander-head anyway.  More power to you, and there can only be one! (fake laughter)</p>
