<h1>No Time for Sergeants (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hillbilly, Will Stockdale, drafted into the United States' Air Force, combines crushing naivety, stubbornness, a completely literal mind, and amazing physical strength. Will the Air Force survive all the numerous experiences?</p>
<p>Will Stockdale, a country bumpkin from Georgia, has just been drafted into the Air Force. A simple-minded man, Will befriends fellow recruit Ben Whitledge, a slight, unassuming man who dreams of being transferred into the infantry, where all his brothers served and where generations of his family before him have served. Their friendship is based on being the outsiders amongst the draftees. Because of his simple-mindedness, Will ends up driving all those around him crazy, but none more so than his barracks sergeant, Orville King. Sergeant King, a career military man, is one who survives in the military by not making waves and by having those under him not make waves as to stay under the radar of those higher up. But Sergeant King may not be able to stay under the radar while Will is under his command. Will, along with Ben, gets Sergeant King into one predicament after another, Will often not even realizing he is doing so or that Sergeant King is in a bind unless told by someone else. These predicaments culminate in an incident which could jeopardize the careers of many a general and Will's "good friend", Sergeant King.</p>
<p>Will Stockdale is a country bumpkin drafted into the Air Force and too dumb to realize he's driving everyone around him crazy -- no one more than Sgt. King.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is on my list of my favorite funny movies of all time. I 've lost count of how many times I've seen it, yet each time I view it, I laugh out loud all over again. It's side-splitting humor without crudeness and vulgarity - a quality that today's movies sadly lack. One of my favorite scenes is where all the draftees are being inducted - particularly where Will comes to the aid of his buddy Private Whitledge. I don't know if this is the first film pairing of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, but their chemistry is readily apparent, in the scene where Private Stockdale is having his manual dexterity tested. I live in the southern Appalachians and I never felt once like this movie was derogatory and condescending towards mountain people. Yes, Andy Griffith's Will Stockdale was extremely naive, but he was never portrayed as being less of a human being because he was from the southern mountains and less experienced in life. I always felt like Private Stockdale's naivet√© enabled him to approach things from a different perspective (albeit unknowingly) and come up with quite unique solutions. Andy Griffith was, and is, a master at portraying this kind of character.</p>
