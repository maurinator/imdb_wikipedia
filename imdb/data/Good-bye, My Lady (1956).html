Discussing the matter with his uncle the desire to keep and train the dog for bird hunting after finding the dog has super senseing ability but does not bark.

When the boy finds a strange dog that laughs instead of barking, cleans its self like a cat, and can pick up scents from incredible distances, he reckons on keeping her and training her to point birds...</p>
<p>An old man and a young boy who live in the southeastern Mississippi swamps are brought together by the love of a dog.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was introduced to this movie by my niece, who had seen it at her vocational school. She and her friends (about a dozen girls) sat and watched it over and over, and cried their eyes out at the end every time! For a 50 year old movie to have that much impact on a group of modern 15 and 16 year old kids really says something about the quality of its content. It is certainly out-dated in many ways, and shows training techniques that would, no doubt make the ASPCA cringe today. For those of us that grew up in a little less gentile world it brings back memories of how life used to be. The acting in the film is good throughout, the characters are generally believable. If you have ever had the pleasure of interacting with a Basenji, than you will realize that most of what is depicted in the movie concerning the dog is quite plausible. It is one of the best dog movies I have ever seen, and really worth a look (if you can find it).</p>
