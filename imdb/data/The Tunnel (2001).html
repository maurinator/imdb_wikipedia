<h1>The Tunnel (2001)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's pretty weird.I saw it while staying at the Tromadance condo in Park City this year. Ramzi played it on the tele. Like the theme of the film itself, I lost track of time and got totally weirded out.I highly suggest this film and think it's a must see for fans of the experimental genre. Lloyd Kaufman of Toxic Avenger and Terror Firmer fame is an actor in it. I don't care who says this is a serious role I still think Lloyd's hilarious in it.I gave this film an 8.</p>
