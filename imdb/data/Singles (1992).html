<h1>Singles (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Romantic comedy about six of Seattle's young people, most of whom live in the same apartment building and whose lives revolve around the city's ever-expanding music scene. The inter-related stories about each character's progress through the singles scene are intriguing and often very funny, and the soundtrack is a grunge fanatic's dream, with the likes of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Mudhoney.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the grunge music scene in Seattle, the search for love among a group of twenty-something friends living in the same two-story apartment building is presented. Janet Livermore, an architecture student and waitress, has been dating Cliff Poncier, who also lives in the building. Cliff, the front man for the grunge rock band Citizen Dick, is up front with Janet that he does not consider their relationship to be exclusive, something that she refuses to comprehend in her love for him. Janet goes to extreme lengths to keep Cliff as her man. Steve Dunne, who is working on a speed train project proposal for the city, meets environmentalist Linda Powell at a club. For Steve, it's love at first sight. Linda, however, is slow to warm to Steve as she has a history of making bad choices in men, especially her latest quite recent short term relationship with Luiz, with who she was in love but who deceived her in so many different ways. As Steve and Linda begin to date, whether they have a happily ever after will depend on how they perceive the actions of the other, especially in whether the other is playing "the dating game". And Debbie Hunt, currently boyfriendless, decides to use the gag gift that was given to her by her friends: a video dating service.</p>
<p>A group of twenty-something friends, most of whom live in the same apartment complex, search for love and success in grunge-era Seattle.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Singles is a great film. I loved every minute of this film. Cameron Crowe has directed two films I consider essential viewing. Say Anything was the first and Singles is the second. The cast seemed like real people to me, and I loved all the performances. This film dealt with relationships in the 90's in a very realistic, funny and sometimes sad way. The soundtrack to this film is amazing. Great selection of tunes. This film has many moments you'll be quoting from for quite a long time. Great film.</p>
