<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>God bless the 80's, and may they live on way after their time!  This film captures the 80's geeks, preps, and class rivalry.  It was a hard time to fit in, but a fun time, like most teenagers, I had these fantasies that this movie reflects on.  I can not believe they got Wes from the Road Warrior to do a part.  The scene where the computer animated women talks to Michael Halls parent is hilarious, but sick.  The stuff going out of the chimney, the MX missile, and the kitchen turning blue is funny.  Bill Paxion or chet is a classic wait and see what happens to him.  Anyways rent it live it and be it! 8/10</p>
