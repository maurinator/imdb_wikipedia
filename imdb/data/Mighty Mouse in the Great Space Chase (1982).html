<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I remember watching this as a child.  Boy,  I rented this title over and over again.  Loved it.  The storyline was amazing and the animation was superb. WAS.  Recently I had the opportuinty to watch it again.  Wow,  what happened?  The animation doesn't look good at all.  The backgrounds are flat,  repeat animation is used to excess,  and the storyline is so random and well,  not very good at all.  I watched it once and didn't have the urge to watch it again.  Unlike series such as the Transformers which will never get old,  this movie has aged and those who watch it now after viewing it as a child will wonder how they ever were amazed at the show. Still,  children today will probably enjoy it,  and I recommend it to children who want to see a space chase,  no,  a GREAT space chase!</p>
