<h1>Hopscotch (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>CIA agent Miles Kendig decides to get out of 'the game' and to ensure he's left alone he threatens to send his memoirs to the world's intelligence agencies. When the CIA doesn't believe him, he calls their bluff and starts writing and sending out chapters one by one. Realizing that their operations would be compromised, the CIA (led by Myerson and Cutter) set out to put an end to Kendig's plan by whatever means necessary. The heart of the movie follows a game of cat and mouse between a fumbling CIA and an artful Kendig.</p>
<p>Grounded with a desk job by incompetent superiors, a clever CIA agent retires and writes a tell all memoir that will embarrass his bosses, prompting him to go on the run and elude them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't think a movie like this could get made today. Funny, clever and understated, it's exactly the kind of movie that does not lend itself well to Burger King merchandising or witty catch-phrases (although "I'd say he has you well and truly by the short hairs" comes close). Instead, this is simply a funny, charming and romantic spy thriller that's all about Walter Matthau's great acting. As others have said, this is a movie I can see again and again for the great acting and hilarious moments. Thankfully, it's finally available on DVD.</p>
