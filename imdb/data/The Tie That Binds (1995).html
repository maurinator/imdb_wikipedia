Janie is soon adopted by southern California carpenter Russell Clifton and his wife Dana - and what they don't know is that they're in for the fight of their lives. John and Leann are trying to locate Janie and will stop at nothing to find her, even if it means killing whoever is in their way. When John and Leann discover that Janie was adopted by Russell and Dana, they plot to kill Russell and Dana and take Janie, but one thing they don't expect is for Russell and Dana to fight back with all they've got, because Russell and Dana are willing to do whatever it takes to hold on to the new daughter that they have grown to love.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this movie.    The directing was excellent and he used shades of red to produce enchantment around that cute little girl Julie Devin. Moira Kelley looked like a motherly angel and her husband was somewhat corny, but attractive and very fatherlike.    Hannah sure has changed from Splash where she looks much more older yet she still shows a style and insecurity in her character.   Hannah's character is presented as someone that is not completely evil,  yet her muscular rowdy husband appears to be the real headmaster of their brutal plans.    The violence in the movie isn't graphic and the love between Moira and Julie is wonderfully established. Hannah is silky smooth and appears to really fit the role of a dirty,   insecure woman.   I liked the way the movie made many connections of the theme like mother like daughter(also father) and the scenes when Julie used violence was quite surprising,  humorus, and actually thrilling.   The movie wasn't the greatest thriller,  yet the characters,  performances,  and scenes showed talent and I was satisfied with the rental.</p>
