<h1>Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mountain Rivera, a punchy has-been managed by the unprincipled Maish, is mauled in a fight and forced to quit boxing. Can his devoted cutman and a sympathetic social worker help him find a life outside the ring, or will Maish find a way to exploit him one more time?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This Rod Serling written story originally was televised on the old CBS Playhouse 90 program which was live TV.  This film produced by David Susskind sticks pretty much to the Playhouse 90 version with a few variations and a couple of characters.  Anthony Quinn seems more like a heavyweight than Jack Palance did for one thing and the individual that Maish Rennick is in debt to is also more colorful than in the Teleplay.  Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris are as good in their roles as the actors who were in the Teleplay.  The ending is slightly different and I found it to have more stark realism than the Teleplay.  Check out the fighter that Mountain is in the ring with when the film starts.</p>
