<h1>Toy Story (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The police confiscated a load of toys, which the mayor promptly promised to donate as Christmas presents to an orphanage, actually for the photo-opportunity with him as Santa. Charlie realizes some still contain hard-drugs, so they, Stewart and Paul, which two bicker over Christmas cards, must sneak in to test and weed the toys, but are found out. Carter meanwhile visits a rest home, like every year, but now Caitlin, unwilling to admit being less humanitarian, volunteers to help, only to find herself stuck with the rotten jobs, like shoveling snow, while he still gets the appreciation.</p>
<p>Confiscated toys may become part of a photo op for Randall, who undermines Charlie's staff meetings. Carter persuades Caitlin to volunteer with him in a retirement home. Paul seeks jokes to enliven the City Hall holiday greeting card.</p>
