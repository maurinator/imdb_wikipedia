<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm a casual anime fan, someone who doesn't know the intricate plots and history of the genre as much as I supposedly should.  I think that's a good thing.So often I watch anime that's been hailed as the best thing since sliced bread, and compared to other more mainstream (read: non-anime) features, IMO it doesn't even come close.  I think fans of sub-genres tend to be blind to real critique of their favorite subjects, because they need to justify their excessive interest in it.That being said, you still need to compare like-genre films to one another - at least to some degree, and I think in this case Escaflowne does a great job standing up to its competitors.Someone had previously mentioned that the faces in this feature were rather badly drawn, and I tend to agree - it's odd, because the quality of the rest of the scenes/ scenery, is relatively good.  The plot in this film, as in most anime is VERY disconnected, with whole chunks missing at parts.  Rewinding certainly helps when watching this. However, as with most good anime, even if there is some plot missing, the end message is fairly clear.  The score is amazing.  It's rare you hear this kind of music in "regular" movies, much less an animated feature.In general, I would recommend watching this on DVD, as you will want to rewind at some points, and try to understand certain elements, and/or watch the fast scenes a few more times.</p>
