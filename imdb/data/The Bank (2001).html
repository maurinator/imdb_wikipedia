<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This story is along the lines of 'Runaway Jury'. Old injustices takecenter stage in the mind of the involved and revenge is the goal.Well done movie. A refreshing change from the 'shoot'em up'endless car chases and bullets flying everywhere fare andbuildings being blown to smithereens. Well acted, some intrigueand the vocabulary was not offensive for the most part. I Highlyrecommend this movie to anyone wanting to be entertained by asolid story line, good acting by a lot of unknowns, to me anyhow. Istill haven't figured out Sibylla Budd's character, very enigmatic. Itwas filmed in Australia and Italy according to the Internet MovieData Base.</p>
