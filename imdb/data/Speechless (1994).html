<h1>Speechless (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two political speechwriters fall in love before they find out they are working for candidates on opposite sides.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie STILL remains my favorite romance film of all time! The yearning; the indecision; the misunderstanding; the confusion; the thrill of having to keep their encounters undercover; the fact they both landed at the same love song (No Se Tu); the "prove it" test Julia gives Kevin; and BEST of all, the SENSE-OF-HUMOR unites all the elements for a PERFECT LOVE story. I truly appreciated the character of Julia because she wasn't your typical woman rescued by a "rich-guy" as most romance movies have it. And how can one not melt for Kevin's vulnerable openness and the fact he was not intimidated by Julia's success but rather appreciated her for it. All my friends can have their "Pride and Prejudice", but I know better than to under-estimate the melting power of a funny guy. I should know, I married one--still chuckling 27 years and counting.</p>
