<h1>Creep (2008)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Okay so this is one seriously tiny short that's playing on the famous old urban legend of the deadly secret stranger in the backseat, but it quite admirably does live up to its name for a mere two minutes and it delivers those creeps! It cranks up the tension really well and by the end you're primed for a scare. And it's the type of jump-scare that works too, subtle, quick and not in your face, and I like that even though you're fully expecting it from the start, when it happens it still leaves you with a bit of a jolt. The set point of view of the woman's face and the shadows behind her that are a little too dark and oppressive as she chatters on the phone and makes a few rather on the nose remarks about her driving situation is claustrophobic and suspenseful. And when the light flashes over the monstrous leering man for a split second right at the back of her head staring intently it's very unnerving, I mean just imagine that behind you when you're isolated and driving a deserted highway in the middle of the night. And as she gasps at the last second as the man attacks and you don't see what happens next, that did actually make me jump, which is something that I always take as a good sign as it doesn't happen to my movie-jaded horror-loving soul very often at all! It's a nice compact short, I like the atmosphere and eeriness of it, it's probably more suspenseful than scary, but it's frightfully well done for how short it is. Have a nice night, and always check your damn back seat!</p>
