<h1>Who Dares Wins (2013)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Zaha Hadid died in March 2016 aged only sixty-six of a heart attack. During her career she had established herself as one of the world's leading architects with a business employing over four hundred people worldwide. She was chiefly known for creating memorable structures such as the aquatic center at the Olympic Park in London.Alan Yentob's profile charts her career from humble beginnings in Iraq, her move to London and her meteoric rise to fame at the Architectural Association School, where she revealed a unique talent for painting and drawing as well as designing.Eventually branching out on her own, she suffered several reversals before establishing herself in the late Nineties with buildings in Germany. From then on she never looked back; at the time this program was made, she was supervising two buildings, one in Baku, Azerbaijan and the other at London's Serpentine Gallery.Despite her colorful career, the documentary proved curiously unrevealing. Perhaps Yentob was slightly scared of Hadid's rather formidable presence; or perhaps the program lacked sufficient insight into why her architecture was so unique.</p>
