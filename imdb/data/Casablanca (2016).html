<h1>Casablanca (2016)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is the story of Casablanca, the city that somehow resembled in real History what Hollywood had freely described in its classic film. In 1942 American glamour brought new life to French grandeur in the so-called Pearl of its African colonies: Casablanca had been conceived as a model capital by French architects and general, and over the 20th century became front line of World History, from WWII to Cold War, including revolutionary movements and decolonization. During these 5 decades, it kept attracting workers that gathered in a melting pot of European, Arabs, Christian, Muslim and Jews, enjoying an international status that their citizens still recall from many places around the World.</p>
<p>Casablanca evokes romance, freedom fighters and magic. Under the myth built by Hollywood lies a town full of stories, such as that of the Spanish community that played a key role to turn Casablanca in the French colonial pearl in Africa.</p>
