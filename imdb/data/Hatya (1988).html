<p>This is Govinda's first big hit This is one of his watchable films and not his mindless comedies he did post 1990's though some were goodThe film has a nice story and the moments between Govinda and the kid are adorable and slowly the film catches your attentionHowever the pace does move slowly and the story takes too longThe film is well handled and has comedy, emotions well balancedKirti Kumar does a great job handling the filmMusic is okay, though too many songsGovinda those days wasn't considered a good actor but he surprised He acts restrained unlike in most films and gives a mature performance Neelam is okay, Johny Lever is loud Anupam Kher is okay the kid is adorable</p>
