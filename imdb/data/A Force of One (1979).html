<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chuck Norris gives a less than scintillating performance in this early work but just about passes muster in his role as a professional karate fighter helping police track down a serial killer who uses martial arts.The fight scenes are acceptable if not that spectacular and are helped no end by the presence as the villain of Bill Wallace,the real life champion with the famous "superfoot" who proves a tough match for Norris at the climax.Other performances from the likes of Jennifer O'Neill and Ron O'Neal are serviceable and give flavour to what is essentially an example of the sort of movie that would shortly become so popular in the burgeoning video boom that shortly followed its original release.This eventually provided the core of Chuck Norris fans that were enough to give him for a brief time a taste of 'A'list movie stardom in the early to mid 80's.</p>
