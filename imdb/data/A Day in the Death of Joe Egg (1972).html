<h1>A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A couple uses extremely black comedy to survive taking care of a daughter who is nearly completely brain dead. They take turns doing the daughter's voice and stare into the eyes of death and emotional trauma with a humor that hides their pain.</p>
<p>Peter Medak's film illustrates the problems a married couple have in coming to terms with their child's severe disability. At first, it seems that they deal with the situation by laughing about it. However as the film progresses we see that the husband, Bri has given up hope for his daughter and believes that her death would be a release whereas his wife, Sheila believes that she will one day recover. It also becomes apparent that Bri's humor is indeed his way of dealing with the trauma but Sheila's laughter is an attempt to keep Bri happy and the marriage together. The characters of Bri and Sheila represent opposite sides of the moral argument on such cases: do we have the right to decide whether a human being should live or die or is it cruel to artificially prolong a life that consists only of severe fits and constant pain?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Long before Terri Schiavo brought the issue of living as a "vegetable" to the public view, "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" dealt with it. Alan Bates plays Bri, a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely brindled. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives, but they can't escape the facts. At one point, they even consider euthanasia. The question circling them and their friends is: what will ever become of this predicament? With this movie, Alan Bates continued his streak of really good movies, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can safely say that he will be sadly missed.</p>
