<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rob (Daktari Lorenz) works days cleaning dead bodies up from fatal car crashes on the Autobahn, develops a sick fascination with death and collects body parts and internal organs which he stores in mason jars back at his cramped apartment. In order to spice up a rocky relationship with his equally disturbed necro girlfriend (Beatrice M), he brings home a rotted corpse for a m√©nage-a-troix, which backfires when she decides she prefers the stiff to him! The grainy, low-budget feel adds extra oomph to the shock value, not to mention some gritty atmosphere, and there is certainly enough depraved sickness to go around, including one of the most twisted and memorable endings in horror history. In addition to all the simulated gore, a real rabbit is killed and skinned, there are some hilariously misplaced "artistic" touches and loads of full (often unappealing) nudity. Film Threat offers a subtitled and unrated (would be X) version, and its 1989 sequel, NEKROMANTIK 2: RETURN OF THE LOVING DEAD.</p>
