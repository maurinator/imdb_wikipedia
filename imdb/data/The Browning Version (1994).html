<h1>The Browning Version (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Andrew Crocker-Harris is an embittered and disliked teacher of Greek and Latin at a British public school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. The boys regard him as a Hitler, with some justification. His wife Laura is unfaithful, and lives to wound him any way she can. Andrew must come to terms with his failed life and regain at least his own self-respect.</p>
<p>A student (Taplow, played by Ben Silverstone) completely changes the the self-perception of his master (Andrew Crocker-Harris, played Albert Finney) so that he can accept his forced retirement from his academic establishment his head with his head held high.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not, perhaps, the most moving or emotional film you are likely to see. However it is my opinion that The Browning Version displays some of the finest acting ever to be seen by Albert Finney and his supporting cast. The story itself is very well written and sets an example for other British films to follow. So if you are fed up with action packed, no-brainer movies and would like something to sit back, watch and enjoy then The Browning Version is the film you need.</p>
