<h1>My Fair Lady (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pompous phonetics professor Henry Higgins is so sure of his abilities that he takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney working-class girl into someone who can pass for a cultured member of high society. His subject turns out to be the lovely Eliza Doolittle, who agrees to speech lessons to improve her job prospects. Higgins and Eliza clash, then form an unlikely bond -- one that is threatened by an aristocratic suitor.</p>
<p>Gloriously witty adaptation of the Broadway musical about Professor Henry Higgins, who takes a bet from Colonel Pickering that he can transform unrefined, dirty Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a lady, and fool everyone into thinking she really is one, too! He does, and thus young aristocrat Freddy Eynsford-Hill falls madly in love with her. But when Higgins takes all the credit and forgets to acknowledge her efforts, Eliza angrily leaves him for Freddy, and suddenly Higgins realizes he's grown accustomed to her face and can't really live without it.</p>
<p>A chance meeting between two noted British linguists, Prof. Henry Higgins and Col. Hugh Pickering, leads to a wager that will test Higgins' skills. After they hear a cockney flower girl caterwaul in the street, Higgins proposes to transform the girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a refined Victorian lady with an aristocratic accent. After some hesitation Eliza agrees to become their test case.</p>
<p>A misogynistic and snobbish phonetics professor agrees to a wager that he can take a flower girl and make her presentable in high society.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The actual plot is that Eliza hires Higgins after hearing him boast that with his speech training alone, she could appear to be a "proper lady". He accepts, treating it as a challenge, and in the beginning they develop a dislike for each other as they stubbornly continue the training program. Here is one element that lifts this story to the level of greatness - not only the man-woman conflict arises, but the upper-lower class contrast is explored, as it existed in Edwardian England. Things become quite complex, since Higgins is a confirmed bachelor and Eliza only wants to improve herself; but they insensibly come to have respect for each other, and a strange sort of interdependence develops. And she is NEVER subservient to him, and holds her own and stands her ground. Not many films give such respect to the female character, allowing her to be equal and even dominant - though the man doesn't realize it.I strongly urge any newcomer to this film to listen carefully to the words of the songs - Shakespeare named his man-woman duel/romance "Taming of the Shrew"; My Fair Lady could be called "Taming of the Chauvinist" - and it is well expressed in each musical number. The music evolves right along with the story. And the music - well, it was the first Broadway album to sell a million copies, and was #1 on the Billboard Chart for 15 weeks!! In summary, Eliza, as I say, is the protagonist, and she exerts as profound a change in Higgins as he does in her. The barriers of both class and sex are breached, and never was the egalitarian tale told with such honesty and art.</p>
