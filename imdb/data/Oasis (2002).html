<h1>Oasis (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jong-du, a young man just out of prison for manslaughter, is a social misfit: fidgety, snuffling, laughing inappropriately, without a super ego. When released, he calls on the family of the victim; they send him away, but not before he has seen Gong-ju, a young woman disabled severely by cerebral palsy. Both are abused by their families, and both are used by them as well. Although their relationship begins with Jong-du's criminal behavior, a friendship develops. They talk of favorite things; he washes her hair; they go out; in late night phone calls, he helps her past her fears of the dark. Is there a place in the world for these two inarticulate people?</p>
<p>An irresponsible and childish ex-con befriends a girl with cerebral palsy and develops a progressively stronger bond with her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I misread the synopsis before seeing this movie. I thought it was to be something like Clockwork Orange's 'ultraviolent' Beethoven groovin character. Auf dem Gegenteil! Instead, I was strait-jacked to my theater seat with a ball gag and shown --- love.The director 'has you at hello' with his mastery of inducing the vicarious experience of being judge, jury and executioner. While at first, I wanted to serve merely as a lawmaker/enforcer, it later began to dawn on my oh so thick skull, that here was a stereogram of love. You look at a stereogram and at first see nothing to justify further indulgence. Then you keep on looking anyway and get your reward. OASIS reward for looking into the private lives of the two lead characters is knowing once and for all: the meaning of love. Love is.</p>
