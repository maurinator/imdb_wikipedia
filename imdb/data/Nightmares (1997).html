<h1>Nightmares (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At the hell-mouth, the Master of evil explains to his boy heir Collin that fear rules people better then love or hate. He manages to use the young schoolboy Billy Palmer to make every student of Sunnydale High's terrifying nightmares come true, ranging from Xander appearing in class wearing only boxer-shorts to being chased by murderers, losing one's favorite abilities or poisonous spiders coming out of one's schoolbooks...</p>
<p>Xander walks into class naked except his boxers-shorts, Willow is in concert but she can't sing, and Giles suddenly finds himself unable to form coherent sentences - the residents of Sunnydale are living out their worst nightmares, and Buffy's nightmares are worse than most.</p>
<p>Buffy and her friends discover that their worst nightmares have become reality.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The veil between reality and dreams is falling in this episode. People's nightmares are coming to life and walking around Sunnydale. It turns out that a little boy in a coma has somehow plugged into people's deepest fears and made them real. Buffy's father abandons her, Giles can't read, Willow has to sing in public, Xander's being chased down a hallway and Cordelia's having a major bad hair day. Yes, it's safe to say that the Scoobies are not happy. (If you really want to take this another level, consider how many of those nightmares actually come true in later episodes. For instance, Buffy and her dad in "Forever," when he doesn't even come to Joyce's funeral. Giles going blind in "Something Blue." Willow reluctantly warbling out a few lyrics in "Once More with Feeling." Xander being chased through the school in "The Zeppo." Cordelia's hair throughout season four of "Angel." It's kind of interesting.) Anyway,the episode has a cool dream-like quality to it. Where time has no meaning and its somehow day and night all at once. Places move and change, people's clothing switches around, giant bees swarm over roof tops and -oh yeah!- turns out you forgot to study for that history test, Buffy. Honestly, it's lots of fun to watch.This is a great idea for an episode, but it happened too early in the series run for it to really resonate. In season one, all the quirks and problems of the characters are still being established. "Restless" in season four does a better job of showing their deeper fears and insecurities. As does "Fear Itself" also in season four. By that point in the series, we know more about what drives and terrifies the characters. My biggest complaint about "Nightmares" is Angel, though. Why doesn't he get a nightmare vision? (I know, he gets his own dream episode in the fifth season of "Angel," but "Nightmares" could have shown another whole set of fears for him.) Angel has so many insecurities that the episode could have played off of. And he definitely should have seen Buffy as a vampire, since its the only time she'll get to be one. That was a wasted opportunity.My favorite part of the episode: Xander standing up to that creepy birthday clown. "And your balloon animals sucked! Anyone can make a giraffe!"</p>
