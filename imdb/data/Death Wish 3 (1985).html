<h1>Death Wish 3 (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Paul Kersey, New York City architect and part-time vigilante, returns from L.A. to visit an old friend. Instead, he must avenge his death by fighting youth gangs.</p>
<p>Paul Kersey returns to New York to visit his friend Charley, who lives in one of the worst parts of New York City. But when Paul arrives at Charley's apartment, he finds Charley dying after a vicious beating by a gang led by Manny Fraker, and the police enter the apartment and find Paul standing over Charley's body. Paul is arrested for the murder, but police chief Richard S. Shriker is like Paul with a badge -- he's a big fan of Paul. Shriker offers a deal: Paul can kill all the punks he wants to kill, if he keeps the cops informed about the death count. Shriker releases Paul to go after Fraker. Paul moves into Charley's apartment in a decaying building in the middle of a bombed out gang war zone. The building is populated by a group of elderly tenants who are absolutely terrified by Fraker and his gang. Among the tenants are Charley's friend Bennett, an old watch repairman who keeps a couple of machine guns in his closet. There is also an elderly Jewish couple who live on the first floor. The neighborhood is ruled by Fraker, who wears a reverse Mohawk: He keeps his hair on the sides, but shaves down the middle, to make room for a gang symbol in war paint. Paul buys a .475 Wildey Magnum with exploding big-game cartridges, spends an afternoon planting explosive charges in the bullets, and loads up for war against Fraker.</p>
<p>Paul Kersey, the vigilante, returns to New York to visit a friend. But when he arrives he finds his friend dead, and the police enter and find him standing over the body holding a gun. At the station a police lieutenant recognizes him as the vigilante, and releases to go after the gang that killed his friend, who are led by the deadly Manny Fraker. So Kersey moves into his friend's apartment and along with his friend's friend, Bennett, they try to get the gang and help the neighbors who are being plagued by Fraker and his gang.</p>
<p>Architect/vigilante Paul Kersey arrives back in New York City and is forcibly recruited by a crooked police detective to fight street crime caused by a large gang terrorizing the neighborhoods.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's "bad guy vs good guy" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! When Charlie runs out of ammo for the Heavy Machine gun, he runs back to his crib and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol! This pistol can stop a freakin ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes the size of hub caps into bad guys with it! And if that is not enough, Charlie is also packing an anti tank grenade launcher, which by the way, is only good if he can get the CREEPS clumped together.The acting in this movie is "ha ha" great and a lot of off the wall actors (mainly playing CREEPS) appear throughout the movie! The film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene/line is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in Jail and calmly explains to him: "Tell you what I am going to do ...I'm gonna kill a little old lady ...just for you! ...catch it on the six o'clock news".Is this film violent? Heck yes! But, you'll laugh and cringe all the way through!!!!</p>
