<h1>The Cemetery Club (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This comedy filled with much Jewish humor is about the widows Doris, Ester and Lucille, whose husbands die one after another in just a few years. Even though the three friends, all in their 50's, react quite differently on their husbands deaths they become even closer than what they were as couples. They frequently visit their husband's graves together and talk about perspective lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a "baby boomer" flick, I totally enjoyed it and thought that the story line was excellent and all the actors were fabulous. The younger generation would not understand the meaning or the humor. This is an all star cast of baby boomer's or older and I think they should be commended for their stellar acting. Ellen Burstyn is beautiful and gave a wonderful performance as usual. Diane Ladd is funny and beautiful. Olympia Dukakis is perfect for the part she played. Lainie Kazan is so funny with all her marriages living her life to the fullest. Everyone should have a group of friends that love and support each other through all of life's ups and downs.</p>
