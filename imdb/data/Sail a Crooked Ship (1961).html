<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film once 36 years ago when I was 8 years old. I remember watching it and seemingly laughing all the way through it at the antics of these crazy guys who steal a ship and sail it to America to rob a bank. They have a plan to distract the bank staff by one of them collapsing with a make believe heart attack, leaving the other members of the gang to make good with the cash. Unfortunately the day they arrive in America is a bank holiday (and apparently the only day they can pull off the robbery. The rest of the details are bit hazy, but the thing is this film made such an impression on me that 36 years later I can still recall watching it and laughing until I was nearly sick. I would dearly love to see it again, even at the risk of bitter dissapointment.</p>
