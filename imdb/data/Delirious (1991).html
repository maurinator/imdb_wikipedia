<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack is the head writer for a successful soap opera, and he's sweet on the show's star, lovely Laura. It's easy for everyone but Jack to see that she's playing him for a sap. But a conk on the head brings Jack some new insights - and some new powers. He finds himself in Ashford Falls, site of his fictional soap opera -- and everything he writes comes true! It's a fantastic opportunity to get Rachel, Laura's character, to fall in love with him. But life isn't easy even in the fictional world, and even when you're the author!</p>
<p>A soap opera writer gets hit on the head and wakes up as a character in his own show.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Delirious is a creative and funny master piece.  I enjoyed every minute that I watch of the show.  It was very nonpredictable and suprised me many of times.  The writers of this show wrote this movie with style, and having John Candy, the greatest actor in the world, made the movie that much better.  It was enjoyable and fun to watch.  It is even a great show to bring your kids to.  i would recommend this show to anybody who likes comedy and likes John Candy.</p>
