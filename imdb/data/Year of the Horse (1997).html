<h1>Year of the Horse (1997)</h1>

<p>This film documents Neil Young and Crazy Horse's 1996 concert tour. Jim Jarmusch interviews the band about their long history, and we see backstage footage from the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jim Jarmusch has always been one of my favorite directors, and I also happen to be a fan of Neil Young's music. I found this documentary very interesting and well-made. I suppose that it's not for everybody, though. Jarmusch can be a little strange at times (I like that, but other people might not).</p>
