<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was such an engaging film, the more so because of it's basis in fact. I saw this first around 1981 or 82 on cable tv, which I recorded, but had stolen by a guest. I still have the audiocassette recording I made from the vinyl record and listen to it often. Recently, I obtained the DVD through Barnes and Noble (request services). All of the stage performances are riveting and they culminate in that spellbinding finale down in Tennessee. I too cannot fathom why it never hit the bigtime. If it were to be re-released in theaters today it could still be a minor hit.</p>
