<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lana's a singer who ultimately falls for a prince, a real prince. The best way to review a movie of someone's favorite actor, is to ask what if someone else played that part? Well, if anyone else had been in this movie other than Lana, I probably wouldn't have watched it. While it may not win any awards, it's not terribly bad either; in fact, it's the kind of film you'd remember fondly. I could see someone watching this late at night or on vacation and enjoying its simplicity. It's very charming and also stars a young Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main ("Ma Kettle")and Ezio Pinza does have a great voice. But, having said all that, I get the feeling watching it that this project must have come to Lana at a career low. Watching such a big guy as Ezio Pinza in certain scenes (you'd have to see it to know what I mean) was just too much, becoming either unintentionally funny or just plain silly. It might would have been more effective, had they picked a younger male lead with more appeal. But upon seeing this again recently, I couldn't get over how much I liked its unpretentiousness and somewhat carefree attitude, despite the serious ending with the letter the son wrote that Ezio read over the phone. It all worked to make a straightforward film, not trying to be anything but what it is.If I had to pick the four of Lana's films that I think are the weakest, they would be "Bittersweet Love", "The Prodigal", "Love Has Many Faces", and maybe this one. But this is much better than the others. Finally, though, I would have to say that a movie's ending makes you either satisfied or dissatisfied with it. Usually short movies wrap things up with a pat or forced resolution and too quickly. This ending flowed and allowed you to feel your way out...In other words, only Lana fans would watch this, and only they will be rewarded in small ways. While no Lana classic, this is very enjoyable and deserves to get more attention for being another example of good clean family entertainment like they used to make.</p>
