<h1>The Happy Time (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Spring inspires lessons in love and life for a French family in 1920s Ottawa, especially for teenage Robert, who's blind to the attentions of an American neighbor girl, because he's infatuated with the beautiful new maid, fleeing life as a magician's assistant. Robert's mother bemoans some of the Bonnard family male role models available to Robert: his party animal grandfather, roguish traveling salesman uncle Desmond, and an uncle who carries a water cooler filled with wine everywhere while his wife does all the work. As Desmond's temporarily off the road, he also targets the maid.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this is a minor detail but the family is not Quebecois, the are actually French-speaking Ontarians.The father and his brothers are French and (Protestant!!)immigrants to Ottawa (Ontario) and the mother is of Scottish descent. This explains in part why the film did not garner much enthusiasm among French Canadians who generally viewed being protestant and French as being akin to treason. The movie is based on a series of short stories by Robert Lafontaine about his childhood in Ottawa's Lower Town. The stories were very popular in the 1940's and became a play. The play has since become a minor staple of high school productions.</p>
