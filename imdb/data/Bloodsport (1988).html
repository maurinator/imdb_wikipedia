<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Frank Dux has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament, where participants are seriously injured, even killed. Frank decides to go despite being told by his superiors in the army that he can't because they need him. Two army officers are sent to get him and the trail leads to Hong Kong but Frank eludes them. While Frank advances, he knows that he may have to face Chong Li, the defending champion, who has killed a few participants.</p>
<p>Frank Dux has entered the "kumite", an illegal underground martial-arts competition where serious injury and even death are not unknown. In town for the fight are a number of fighters (all with different styles), as well as a journalist determined to get her story. Chong Li, a particularly ruthless and vicious fighter is the favourite, but then again Dux has never fought him before.</p>
<p>Frank Dux is an American martial artist. His former teacher in the martial arts, gives him an invitation to "The Kumite", the secret martial arts tournament where only the world's best fighters are invited. Frank shows up in Hong Kong for the tournament, but his CO's in the US Army are right on his tail. Frank wins match after match, and shows promise that he may be the first person from the Western Hemisphere to win the tournament, until the defending champion gets his hands on Frank's friend, Jackson, and injures him in the Quarter Finals. Now Frank faces an uphill climb. His friend is hurt, the US Army is on his tail, and he is on the verge of making martial arts history. The question is, will he?</p>
<p>As a child, a miscreant Frank Dux was taken in and trained by a champion martial artist, who went so far as to adopt Frank into his family after the premature death of his own son. Now, decades later, Frank is a skilled martial artist himself and a soldier in the U.S. Military. Upon the death of his surrogate father and sensai, Frank is informed of a mysterious, no-holds barred, highly illegal martial arts tournament in Hong Kong known only as the "kumeti." At the bidding of his sensai and against direct orders from his military superiors Frank travels to Hong Kong to participate and uphold his master's honor. In order to succeed not only will he have to win the tournament; he must also evade capture by two military police sent to arrest him and the prying questions of a nosy reporter eager for a story.</p>
<p>Follows Frank Dux, an American martial artist serving in the military, who decides to leave the army to compete in a martial arts tournament in Hong Kong where fights to the death can occur.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you look at the rating for this film it is only 5.8 percent at present that is a serious understatement of this films genius. This film deserves a much more higher rating. Okay its not an Oscar winner for acting, but who cares! its not about acting its about true martial arts and fighting on the big screen and Bloodsport brings this to you superbly. One of my favourite movies it also provides the Rocky pump, as in like Rocky it has the emotion both in action and through the films music and the fighting makes you want to get up and starting punching and kicking anything! and you don't get that sort of feeling with many films. Rocky had it and Bloodsport has it, and if a fighting film makes you get up and fight your living room wall then its a winner! Van Damme is excellent, his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking, the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed, and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb, the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other, thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 10/10 for me. Fantastic film!</p>
