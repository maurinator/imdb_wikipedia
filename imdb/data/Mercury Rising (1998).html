<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mercury Rising, was a loved/hated movie for quite a few viewers, especially the critics who were unapologetic in delivering a 'Razzie' award to Bruce for three films, that he was a part of in that same year. pretty harsh, well for one I feel that Bruce Willis always brings something controversial to any project he does...himself. Mercury Rising, I was happy with and entertained, which was what this government cover-up story was all about. As the sort of troubled outcast on somewhat good-terms Willis is a master. This is a lock-fit for him, he does it so well and on the other hand he slips out and accomplishes other performances with just the same skill. I.e. "The Sixth Sense" (1999) creepy-good story that he brings that Ole' Willis insight to and gives a leveled measure of believable acting that makes you say "Wow". This given, I liked the original working title to the film, Mercury Falling would have worked well too. The autistic boy, (Miko ) is really outstanding at bringing in the over/under balanced brain of Autism to understated believability. He brought that character to it's living end. That is impressive for such young actors to have so much meddle that they can use in their craft. Then there is the one who makes 'hating heavies' a way of life, Alec Baldwin, who always can appear meaner that a bull- rattle snake. His F.B.I man is as solid and scary {as the I would think} the real mean ones come. All in all fairness, this lacked totally connecting everything for a perfect film, but if you watch it uninterrupted and settle in to enjoy what this is, you should get a lot of story entertainment out of it, no problem. There is a lot of garbage made these days, and it is refreshing to see a story that you can watch and take something else away, the next viewing as well. Bruce has the juice...(****) Recommended for Willis fans, but not limited to.</p>
