<h1>A Place Called Chiapas (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the Zapatista National Liberation Army took over five towns and 500 ranches in southern Mexico, the government deployed its troops and at least 145 people died in the ensuing battle. Filmmaker Nettie Wild traveled to the jungle canyons of southern Mexico to film the elusive and fragile life of the rebellion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marcos, takes control over villages and surrounding land, giving it all back to the people. This small time revolution had the Mexican government sweating under the collar to the extend where they had no power to go in and kick arse. Reason being that Marcos, the great manipulator, knew how to play the political game by using the media circus to his advantage. The other help came via the Internet where the Zapatistas were able to communicate their revolutionary ideas to the world. Nettie Wild and her crew capture these strong images that sometimes seem surreal. We have images of the Zapatistas wearing masks, giving them that Phantom mystery. With great pride they ride on horses like the fable heroes Zorro and the Lone Ranger but I think that symbolism of revolution derives from the legendary Mexican hero, Zapata. They pose for the media and in one great scene they ride into Northern Chiapas at dusk, like rescuers that appear from nowhere. That's when Nettie manages to grab a short intimate interview with Marcos. Soon the media circus moves on when the clown stops laughing and the blood seeps through the land with the help of the fascists group, Peace and Justice. But not our hero Nettie. Her crew stayed on but unfortunately not for long enough. They move on as well and till this day the battle for the indigenous people of Chiapas continues. An eye opener for those who feel that revolutionaries are uncool and useless for this day and age.</p>
