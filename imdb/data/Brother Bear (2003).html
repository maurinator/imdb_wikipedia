<h1>Brother Bear (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kenai, a man who resents bears after a fight with one kills his older brother, is turned into a bear so he can see life from a different perspective. He is visited by the spirit of his older brother, and is told that, if he wishes to be changed back into a human, he must travel to the place where the lights touch the Earth, in other words, the Northern Lights. Fueled by hope, Kenai sets off on his long journey, and, along the way, encounters a younger bear, Koda, who is a chatterbox and a fun-loving spirit; Koda is trying to find his way back to his home, the Salmon Run, which, coincidentally, is right next to where the lights touch the Earth. Koda and Kenai team up, but are hunted by Kenai's other brother, Denahi, who fears that the bear has killed Kenai as well. Along the way, the two bears meet other friends, including two moose, some rams, and some mammoths, with whom they hitch a ride. However, Kenai discovers that he likes being a bear, and realizes that humans aren't only afraid of bears; through Koda's eyes, the humans are the monsters, with their long spears. With a whole new view on life, Kenai makes a decision that will change his world forever.</p>
<p>Long ago, as the Earth was emerging from the Ice Age, there were three brothers. After a bear takes the life of the oldest brother, impulsive youngest brother Kenai kills the bear in revenge, only to be transformed into a bear himself. Denahi, the middle brother, comes upon this bear and, thinking it killed Kenai, vows revenge. Now brother hunts brother and Kenai's only hope for survival is to befriend his own worst enemy, a grizzly cub named Koda. Koda's main goal is to show Kenai the real meaning of brotherhood.</p>
<p>When a young Inuit hunter needlessly kills a bear, he is magically changed into a bear himself as punishment with a talkative cub being his only guide to changing back.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Brother Bear seems to be following the mold for the newer Disney Movies. In an effort expand their horizons and take a look at more diverse and different cultures, Brother Bear takes a look at early American Indian culture. The story involves Kenai is the youngest of three brothers and feels he must prove himself to the tribe in an effort to get a mighty animal as his totem. What he gets is an experience of life as a bear after a tragedy befalls his family. He meets many different animals along the way including two moose whose voices are portrayed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas and who revise their roles and Doug and Bob Mckenzie those two crazy Canadians. They as well as some rams on a mountain top and the young Koda, Kenai's bear companion are very funny. I found myself laughing out loud by myself.</p>
