<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What looks like a typical bollywood affair is actually a film enriched with deep human emotions. It comments upon relationships of love, marriage and friendship. Starts out as a cute and sparkling romance between an ordinary man Rajesh Khanna and Mumtaaz who is the only child of rich parents. Yes, they marry and the initial cute and sparkling chemistry is short lived. Next, you'll expect a 'Love Conquers All' and 'They lived happily ever after' scenario which you will NOT get here. Rajesh Khanna becomes a victim of Insecurity and suspicion and ruins it all -- his love, his friendship, his life, his everything.Which of the performances are the best? The beautiful Mumtaaz with her portrayal of a loving, exuberant and an understanding wife or Rajesh Khanna playing the suspicious husband who brings tears to your eyes seeing his hapless state towards the end, or is it Sanjeev Kumar's portrayal of a friend, the likes of which is a rarity in this world. With this legendary cast you wont have an answer to this question.Kishore Kumar's soulful song -- 'Zindagi Ke Safar Mei Guzar Jaatein Hai' will stick with you long after this is over.Highly Recommended!</p>
