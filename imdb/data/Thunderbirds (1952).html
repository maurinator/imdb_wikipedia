<h1>Thunderbirds (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An Oklahoma National Guard unit, comprised mainly of Native Americans, is called up for duty at the start of World War II.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my favorite moments from this film is early on when an Osage chief, who's talking to a man he just gave a trophy to, asks him why they changed patches to the Thunderbird, and the man shows the old patch, which was a swastika. The man tells the chief, "Hitler took it." The chief says, "Hitler? Oh, crazy man. You take it back son." I understand if you can find an original 45th Division Swastika patch, it's very valuable. I also wish we knew who the chief was. And, the Osages did use their language in real life to confound the Germans. Just so our friend who spoke of the Navajos knows. This is a great flick, and if it's ever on video, get it.</p>
