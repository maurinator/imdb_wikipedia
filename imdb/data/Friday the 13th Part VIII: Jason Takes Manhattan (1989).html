<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite of the series, Jason is awesome he walks around Manhattan like he's Donald Trump. Kickin' boom boxes out of his way, and busting through glass doors. Don't believe all the negative comments about this movie, watch it and judge it for yourself. These movies are not to be taken seriously, just sit back and have fun. Life's hard enough. Jason Takes Manhattan tops my list of great horror movies!</p>
