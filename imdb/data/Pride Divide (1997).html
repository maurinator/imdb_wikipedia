<h1>Pride Divide (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An exploration of how gay men and women have united against global homophobia, and at the same time have been divided over issues of sexism.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>i enjoyed the film and found it very informative and entertaining. having grown up in the lesbian/gay community as it grew from the late 50's and early 60's thru the stonewall period...the aids crisis and now the new century i could relate to much in the film. all to often the male homosexual community has ignored the female homosexual community or worse acted as the male straight community has. many in the female homosexual community have downplayed the efforts of many homosexual men because they did not follow the interests of the female homosexual community. no effort by the straight community could ever have the effect of our own infighting. everyone involved with the community should watch it to learn more about our his/herstory.</p>
