<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Contrary to IMDb grade of this movie and the many reviewers who appraised it as a low to mediocre movie piece i have only the highest praise for this movie.This is not a comedy but this is also not a horror movie.It is a mix of drama,horror and comedy.Eddie Murphys performance as a vampire was amazing and the special effects were awesome.This movie is definitely a classic and quite sure it is misunderstood by most.One of the best vampire movies ever made.10 out of 10 Keep this treasure alive!</p>
