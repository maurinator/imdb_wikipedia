<h1>Staircase (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Charles Dyer and Harry Leeds are a couple that have been living together for nearly 20 years. Both earn a living as hairdressers in the West End of London and both care deeply for their mothers, but not each other as time apart takes its toll on their relationship when Harry has to care for his invalid mother who snips at him every chance she gets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching, or why they are so bitter.  I agree completely with the contemporaneous reviews, which praised the movie highly.  Two fine actors spend the entire movie, out of their normal characters, showing off to each other and producing a gem as a result.  The contrast between Burton's prissy old woman and Harrison's aging swish -- that so embarrassed the Burton character -- was wonderfully portrayed.  Yet they managed to demonstrate that querulous yet enduring relationship that often results between an aging couple that experience each other's foibles, constantly express annoyance at them, and yet have too much basic affection to part.  This is a marvelous movie, and I regret that I can't find it on video to share with others.Maybe it's that I'm not gay that allows me to appreciate the fine craft it exhibits, since it doesn't threaten me personally.</p>
