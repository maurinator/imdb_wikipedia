<h1>The Pornographers (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mr. Ogata lives a complicated life: he is a pornographer making two skin flicks per day and trying to stay beneath the radar screen of the local mob; he deeply loves his ailing wife Haru who's cursed by the restless spirit of her dead first husband; he also has a mistress, a step-son who wants to go to university, and a step-daughter entering adolescence. He lusts after his step-daughter, and when Haru finds out about those sexual advances, she asks him to marry the girl. Haru even signs over her business to him, and a crisis ensues when Ogata uses her nest egg to buy equipment so he and his pals can set up their own film processing lab. Surreal images and events weave their way into Ogata's life.</p>
<p>Life of a pornographer who tries to stay under the radar of the mob. He has a mistress, a step-son, a step-daughter (whom he's attracted to) and a wife who believes her first husband was reincarnated as a restless carp.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Pornographers is an excellent movie that has something important to say about base human sex acts.  The movie also deals with all different types of intra-familial relationships:  husbands and wives, daughters and parents, widows and their former husbands reincarnated as household pets.  The plot confronts a socio-political setting where "erotic films" as they are called are banned, but the great demand for them drives the pornographers who are otherwise destitute with families to support.  The pornographers think they have nothing to lose, but realize just how much they do stand to lose.  It should be noted that there is no nudity or adult content depicted.  The movie is brilliantly filmed with beautiful symbols in the pictures representing the character's inner emotions.  As events grow worse and worse the images grow darker and stranger.  This is an excellent movie for the Fellini-esque audience.</p>
