<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Ada" has a good premise, but unfortunately does not evolve into a good movie.  The soapy melodrama about a "puppet" gubernatorial candidate married to a prostitute does not due justice to the talents of its stars. The fine talents of the three main stars are not fully explored, and their characters are likewise underdeveloped.  The ending is hardly probable, and as a resolution, it leaves a lot to be desired.The cast do the best they can with the material they have. Dean Martin and Susan Hayward are both quite credible in their highly emotional performances.  Wilfrid Hyde-White is also good in portraying a grasping and stifling villain, an unusual role for him.</p>
