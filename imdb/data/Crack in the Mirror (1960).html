<p>The pale beauty of Juliette Greco had always intrigued me.  This movie of ill-starred love, lust and violence with gripping  courtroom scenes (complete with re-enactment of the crime at the  site)etched itself uncomfortably into my memory. That Greco often stars  as a tragic anti-heroine may have something to do with her origins in  the Languedoc region of France of unhappy history (cf. the Albigensian  persecutions).The handsome young Bradford Dillman is a great foil to Greco's acting  talents. Another under-appreciated actor, he reveals his great depth in  other films such as Circle of Deception, where he portrays a betrayed  secret agent used as a pawn by his superiors and Compulsion, where he  plays a megalomaniacal intellectual out to prove the validity  Nietzche's idea of a "superman" who is privileged to cull the human  race of "unworthies" (based on the play "The Rope" of which Hitchcock  made an earlier execrable film version).</p>
