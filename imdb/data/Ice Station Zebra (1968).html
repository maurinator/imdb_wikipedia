<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Commander James Ferraday, USN, has new orders: get David Jones, a British civilian, Captain Anders, a tough Marine with a platoon of troops, Boris Vasilov, a friendly Russian, and the crew of the nuclear sub USS Tigerfish to the North Pole to rescue the crew of Drift Ice Station Zebra, a weather station at the top of the world. The mission takes on new and dangerous twists as the crew finds out that all is not as it seems at Zebra, and that someone will stop at nothing to prevent the mission from being completed.</p>
<p>US naval Commander Jim Ferrady's next mission is to sail his nuclear submarine, the USS Tigerfish, to the multi-nation polar located weather station Zebra. He is told that the mission, which is concurrently being conducted by the Soviets as well, is under the pretense of saving its crew from something that has killed or is killing them. This situation is true, but the real mission is something else related to the ice station. A civilian Brit with a code name Jones, who will be sailing with him and who he doesn't fully trust, knows the real reason of the mission, but refuses to disclose it, but promises to do so if it risks the lives of the sub's crew. Another on board the sub is anti-Soviet Soviet Boris Vaslov, one of the designers of the station. As Vaslov is a friend of Jones, Ferraday also doesn't fully trust him. Jones, in turn, doesn't fully trust everyone on board, most specifically Captain Leslie Anders, who is leading the command of the marines for the mission. It soon becomes apparent that one of these mistrusts is founded as someone on board is sabotaging the mission, that person who is willing to die and kill everyone aboard the sub. The new concurrent mission is to find the saboteur, and discover for who he is working and their motives.</p>
<p>Commander James Ferraday, captain of the nuclear submarine USS Tigershark, is dispatched to the polar ice region on a rescue mission when an emergency signal is received from a research station, Ice Station Zebra. On board is a civilian and likely spy, David Jones, whose orders are secret. Ferraday doesn't like being kept in the dark but Jones is secretive and doesn't give much away. Along the way, they collect two additional passengers, a Russian named Boris Vaslov, likely also a spy, and U.S. Marine Capt. Leslie Anders who will takes command of the Marines traveling as passengers. It soon becomes apparent that the mission is more that just a simple rescue operation. It also becomes apparent that there is a traitor on board the submarine who is out to sabotage the entire mission.</p>
<p>USN nuclear sub USS Tigerfish must rush to the North Pole to rescue the staff of Drift Ice Station Zebra weather station.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The very first film Rock Hudson did after finishing his contractual obligations at Universal Studios was no cheapie. Ice Station Zebra was spared no expense by MGM in bringing the Alistair McLean Cold War novel to the screen. Unfortunately this and some other ill conceived projects are what brought MGM to bankruptcy in the next decade. Though it got only so-so reviews and didn't have the box office that MGM wanted and needed, Ice Station Zebra has stood up well and is really best seen on the big screen. Even a letter boxed version doesn't do the vast polar landscapes justice nor the underwater shots neither. The film was nominated for special effects and color cinematography.Watching Rock Hudson in command of the U.S.S. Tigerfish was like watching James T. Kirk in charge of the Enterprise. I wouldn't be surprised if Hudson took a few cues from William Shatner in his performance. Hudson has an Enterprise like mission and later on leads an away team on a polar icecap where a Russian spy satellite has been busy photographing all of the U.S. missile launching sites. The film is wanted by both sides and both sides send teams to get it.It's a curious bunch that Hudson has to deal with on his team. A Russian defector scientist Ernest Borgnine, British agent Patrick McGoohan (wasn't that ever natural casting) and spit and polish Marine captain Jim Brown. They've all got varying agendas and one in his crew is a double agent.The highlight of the film is the standoff with Hudson and Russian colonel Alf Kjellin. They are an evenly matched pair, I would not like to be playing poker with.Ice Station Zebra is far better than the reviews it got at the time. Even with the Cold War over, it's still an exciting and suspense filled film.</p>
