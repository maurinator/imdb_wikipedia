<h1>The Yes Men (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A comedic documentary which follows The Yes Men, a small group of prankster activists, as they gain world-wide notoriety for impersonating the World Trade Organization on television and at business conferences around the world. The film begins when two members of The Yes Men, Andy and Mike, set up a website that mimics the World Trade Organization's--and it's mistaken for the real thing. They play along with the ruse and soon find themselves invited to important functions as WTO representatives. Delighted to represent the organization they politically oppose, Andy and Mike don thrift-store suits and set out to shock unwitting audiences with darkly comic satire that highlights the worst aspects of global free trade.</p>
<p>Anti-corporate activists travel from conference to conference, impersonating member of the World Trade Organization.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A few years ago, two computer-geeks, Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonnano, set up a mock website of the World Trade Organization (http://www.gatt.org/) and then got mistaken for the real thing. Requests for interviews and lectures flowed in, which Andy and Mike, fearless satirists that they are, gladly accepted. The movie follows their exploits as they go from seminar to news-show to press-conference, mocking the organization they're supposed to represent in front of an unsuspecting audience. Like all idealists they have a naive-streak, like when they compare third-world sweatshops to American slavery and conclude that the sweatshops are far more cost-effective: they seem to expect their audience of textile-manufacturers to rise up in protest, but why should they? Their argument is not only true, but common knowledge among anybody with any grasp on economics. Things get hilarious however, when our speaker then whips out a phallic four foot instrument from his groin area, supposedly designed to prod third world workers by remote control, something which his audience observes as if it's the most normal occurrence in the world. The most revealing moment comes at the end, when our heroes are at a press conference and announce the disbanding of the WTO: when interviewed, the entire corps of financial journalists present seem to agree that the world will be a better place without the World Trade Organization.***1/2</p>
