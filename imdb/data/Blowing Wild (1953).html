<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gary Cooper is looking for work somewhere in South America when he meets an old friend with a succesful oil-digging company.  His wife, however, is an old love from Cooper and the tension can only lead to bad things.  On top of it all, the country suffers from bandits who destroy and rob all material. The story has a negative undertone about the failure Americans have when trying to make it big outside their motherland just like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre with Bogart. The characters are well thought-out and all of them have a solid background. Gary Cooper's character has a past he'd rather forget and it made me think about his character in High Noon. Unfortunately the movie seems to be made in a rush, but due to the story, drama and character studies I give this a 7 out of 10!  And for me that's rather a lot!</p>
