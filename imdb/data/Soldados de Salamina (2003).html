<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>David Trueba's film is somewhat different from other Spanish movies about the Civil War of the 30s. Usually the stories are  about the heroes of the left side, who were defeated at the end, while this story is about one of the Fascists whose life is spared by a militiaman that in theory was his enemy.I must confess that not having read the original novel, I have no basis of comparison, but the theme about knowing what really happened in that particular episode the young reporter is trying to discover is intriguing.This is a part documentary, part fiction and a tale from the real survivors of the conflict. We don't get to know what really happened until the very end of the film as the old soldier in the nursing home meets the writer who has gone to him to find out first hand the truth.The director seems to be saying that heroes were the ones that had the decency to live by what their conscience dictated, rather than by what they were told to do.</p>
