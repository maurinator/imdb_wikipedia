<h1>Silent Scream (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In London's seedy Soho district in 1963, Larry Winters (Iain Glen) murders a bartender with shocking violence. Sentenced to life behind bars, Winters has towering fits of rage that continue until prison doctors assign him to an experimental unit that gives him a route to self-expression. Flashbacks to his deprived Glasgow childhood with a delinquent older brother (Alexander Morton), his harrowing military experience and his history of drug abuse show how this troubled man became a murderer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>SILENT SCREAM is a biopic about convicted murderer Larry Winters . However not content with making a standard prison film the director David Hayman throws a massive spanner in the works by making the movie an art house picture with fractured time lines . We know that Winters served in the army , that he murdered a bar man in cold blood and that he`s serving a life sentence but that`s all we really find out as the story keeps jumping around to different times and places . There`s a vague notion that if you treat dangerous criminals with dignity they can be rehabilitated but this point isn`t really hammered home , and unless you`re aware of Scottish culture like the sectarian divide in the West of Scotland you`ll find much of the film confusing . It`s also a rather bleak film not helped by its obvious lack of budget and I can only recommend it if you`re interested in seeing Brit film star Robert Carlyle and well known TV star Julie Graham in cameo roles</p>
