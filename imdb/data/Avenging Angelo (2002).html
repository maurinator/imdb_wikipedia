<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is worth watching for the picture-perfect comic timing of the actress Madeleine Stowe. Her foil is the hang-dog, laid-back Sylvester Stallone, and this film includes some of Sly's finest work in years.Stowe's character Jennifer is the spoiled daughter of a mafia don; Sly's character Frankie is the trusted bodyguard. From start to finish, there were hilarious moments of comedy delivered primarily by the gifted Stowe.The script by Will Adis included many inspired bits and take-offs on various mafia films. The funniest sequence is when Jennifer learns the mafia meaning of the word "whack," and she decides to snuff out the aged don who killed her father. A whirlwind romance and wedding follow, and on the fateful wedding night, Jennifer sees to it the old don becomes excited just enough to become a flatliner! Again, the timing, takes, and line deliveries were done to perfection by Stowe.A recent film entitled "Spanglish" received great acclaim as parody of bourgeois culture in L.A. But that film pales alongside the witty and well-crafted "Avenging Angelo." In fact, "Spanglish" could have benefited from all of the strengths of "Avenging Angelo," including the good scripting, comic set-ups, and, above all, the style evoked by an underrated comedienne like Madeleine Stowe.</p>
