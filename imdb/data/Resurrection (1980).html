<h1>Resurrection (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Edna Mae Macaulay experiences the afterlife for a brief time after a car accident that kills her husband. As she begins her long process of physical healing, she discovers that she has the ability to heal physical infirmities. While most people simply accept her gift, her lover (Sam Shepard) becomes mentally unbalanced and dangerous because she does not place the healings within a religious context.</p>
<p>A passenger in her husband Joe's new sports car, Edna Mae Macaulay barely survives after the car careens off a California cliff, that accident which took Joe's life. Now a paraplegic, Edna, who briefly died during that incident, is invited back to live with her estranged father, John Harper, in her rural Kansas hometown where most of her extended family still lives. An incident involving a young relative with a nosebleed makes Edna's grandmother Pearl believe that Edna's near death experience may have given her the power to heal. Indeed, Edna is able to recover fully from her own injuries. She becomes a minor celebrity, healing whoever she can, which is about 70% of those she attempts. She doesn't really need to know why she has received these powers, although many others do. Some want to know the scientific reason for her powers. Others don't want her help believing it is the work of the devil. And others, like Cal Carpenter, a man with who she begins a relationship, ultimately believes she is the resurrection of Christ. That belief by Cal, who was healed himself from a potentially life threatening injury by Edna, may take their relationship to an incompatible and potentially deadly state.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has been a favorite of mine since it came out.  I find it very moving, and inspirational, and I am such a SUCKER for movies that have an ending where the last two minutes hit you right in the heart, or the head, or both.  (RE: Shawshank Redemption and Working Girl as two examples)See this movie!  I am sure it will hold different pleasures and bring different insights for different people, but no one will NOT feel something. Wonderful performances by all, and sadly this is truly an underrated and little known film. I hope this will come out on DVD someday.I think I am going to go hunt up my nearly worn out VHS version and watch it again today.  Oh, and when you do get a chance to see it, make sure you share it with a friend.  This is a great movie for discussion after.  I think you, like me, will want to see it again.</p>
