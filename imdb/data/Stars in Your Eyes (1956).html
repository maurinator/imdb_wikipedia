<h1>Stars in Your Eyes (1956)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When this film was made variety,or music hall,had only about 6 years left to run.The only type of show that put bums on seats were the nudie revues.Variety went into TV,as shown at the end of this film.No theatre was going to be able to compete with Sunday Night At The London Palladium.Given also that patrons were deserting cinemas in their droves at this time,why other than colour and scope,would they choose to spend money on watching variety when they could see it for nothing in their homes.The colour is it has top be said very variable.At the climax when the camera is trained on the acts there seems to be a red bias.However when it cuts away to the auditorium it seems quite normal.The only thing in the films favour is that it contains a permanent record of the acts involved.</p>
