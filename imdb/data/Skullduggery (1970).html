<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must have unknowingly been in the test audience for the original version of this film at a local drive-in theater in 1970.  I recently saw the current version on TV again, and was shocked at the mutilation of the original plot.  The movie I remember was longer and the missing scenes and dialogue comprised a biting satire of race relations that still resonates in my memory today.  The present version of the film has sadly had the best scenes and lines excised out, in the name of avoiding controversy in 1970.We have come a long way since then.  This film was far more entertaining in it's original form, and deserves re-release in a Special Edition or Director's cut DVD!</p>
