<h1>Signs of Life (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A touching story of life in rural Maine, and the changes brought about by the closing of a town's small boat-building company -- on which many of the residents depended upon for a living.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with  terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close.  The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective.  I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it.  A beautiful piece of filmmaking.</p>
