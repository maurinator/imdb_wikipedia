<h1>Angry Harvest (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the winter of 1942-43, a Jewish family leaps from a train going through Silesia. They are separated in the woods, and Leon, a local peasant who's now a farmer of some wealth, discovers the woman, Rosa, and hides her in his cellar. Leon's a middle-aged Catholic bachelor, tormented by his sexual drive. He doesn't tell Rosa he's seen signs her husband is alive, and he begs her to love him. Rosa offers herself to Leon if he'll help a local Jew in hiding who needs money. Leon pays, and love between Rosa and him does develop, but then Leon's peasant subservience and his limited empathy lead to tragedy. At the war's end, a ray of sunshine comes from an unexpected place.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think this is a movie not about Nazis or Jews etc. From point of view of a man psyche this is beautiful drama that depicts the inner dilemma between lust and love. Director's amazing imagination intimate that if power is given, we (man) always fall for lusty side of life which is derived by materialism.Movie also tells a lot about human psychology and dynamics during war or during panic created by state.Its very strange that as woman director "Agnieszka Holland" penetrates deep inside the man's psyche. Being directed by a woman this movie is a amazing art of work.Very beautiful creation!</p>
