<h1>Can She Bake a Cherry Pie? (1983)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Zee is walking up and down Manhattan streets, talking to herself and to the husband who has just left her. At a sidewalk caf√© she runs into Eli. A very unlikely, funny and touching relationship develops between two lost souls in the big city, which is the third major character in this film.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you want to see poetry in motion, STUDY the sequences of Michael Marogtta and his pigeon.  An UNFORGETTABLE piece of filmography is about an hour into the film--it lasts under a minute...not a word is spoken...only the music which gives the film its name is heard while Margotta, Frances Fisher and a trained New York City pigeon struggle, dance and eventually part under magic hour light; in front of The Pierre Hotel on 5th Avenue. Breath-taking.</p>
