<h1>It's My Turn (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A successful but stressed mathematics professor (Clayburgh) goes to her father's wedding and falls in love with her father's bride's son (Douglas), a prematurely retired pro baseball player. She must choose between him and her current boyfriend (Grodin), between Chicago and New York, and between research and administration.</p>
<p>Chicago-based college mathematics professor Kate Gunzinger is at a complicated stage of her life. She has just moved in with her boyfriend, Homer, a builder, the move more out of a sense of "why not" than a compelling reason to do so. Their relationship is based on giving the other a total sense of freedom, which includes not being emotionally invested in the other's life. She has an interview for a job in New York City, which is more administrative than research, the balance which she could tolerate more than prefer. If she gets offered the job, she will not truly consider Homer in whether to accept it or not. Her widowed father Jacob is getting remarried in New York City at the same time as her interview, although she isn't sure if she will attend the wedding regardless since she doesn't like Emma, her new stepmother to be. At the last minute, Kate decides to attend the wedding. There, she not only gets a better sense of Emma not only as a woman but as her father's new wife, but also meets Emma's son, ex-Cleveland Indian Ben Lewin, who had to quit the game due to injuries. Despite Ben having a wife and daughter back home in Akron, the two embark on a more than casual relationship. Her short time with Ben that weekend gives Kate a better perspective on what is missing in her life, regardless of if there is a long term future for the two of them.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The final chapter in Jill Clayburgh's unplanned "independent woman" trilogy (the first two were "An Unmarried Woman" and "Starting Over"). This one is from the same writer as "Dirty Dancing," which probably explains why the main character in each is a Jewish woman who is very much "daddy's little girl."Here, the protagonist is perhaps the most glamorous mathematics professor ever (she wears stilettos to class, but earthy gal that she is, removes them while solving equations at the blackboard). She's got relationship issues with her widowed dad who's remarrying, and with her divorced live-in boyfriend, plus she's conflicted about whether to take a new job in a new city that pays much more, but won't allow her to continue her research. She breezily describes her various complications as "modern problems," which tells you that the creators here felt they were at the very cutting edge of portraying the quintessential "liberated" woman. Laura Linney's character in "You Can Count On Me" had a similarly complicated life, but that film didn't feel the need for its characters to be so self-aware.Michael Douglas enters the picture to help her figure out where/how to get the healthy, giving relationship that everyone around her seems to have, and that therefore is "her turn" to get (get it?)This is a decent movie that actually doesn't feel particularly dated, (save for Clayburgh's Oscar-bait "big scene" towards the end) despite its obvious 70's era feminist overtones. But perhaps because of its agenda, the romance doesn't exactly sweep you off your feet.As with most movies from the 80s, part of the fun is seeing what stars/faces of the future show up. Here, we get a young Daniel Stern, almost unrecognizable as Clayburgh's star pupil, and future "Law and Order" District Attorneys Steven Hill and Dianne Wiest.</p>
