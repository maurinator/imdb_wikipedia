<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Raj Kapoor is yet again seen in his simpleton, naive character. He plays the character of RajKumar, an amateur painter. He falls in live with Aarti(Nutan), a rich girl(Seth Ramnath is her uncle played by Motilal). But she does not reveal her true identity. Raj begins to work for Motilal. But what Raj doesn't know is that Seth Ramnath is the uncle of Aarti, and what Seth Ramnath doesn't know is that Aarti likes Raj. Later in the film, Mr. D'sa(landlady of Raj) gets flu. Raj is the main accused. Is he the true killer?Will his love find justice?Watch this film to find out. Raj Kapoor, Nutan have given very strong performances supported by Motilal and Lalita Pawar. Songs rendered by Mukesh are a real gem. No doubt the film won 5 Filmfare awards. A classic film which is comparable to other Raj Kapoor classics like Shree 420.</p>
