<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a totally awesome film. I first saw it when I was 17 and I have watched it many times since, each time gaining something new out of it. Surprisingly philosophical, "Roadkill" will make you think about life, purpose and the universe, it will also make you laugh and, yes, it will make you hum along to it's rocking soundtrack too. From the atmospheric black and white cinematography, to the evocative landscapes of Northland Ontario, to the magnificent, likable and witty character realizations, this is a seminal film that takes an original slant to what could have been a dried out and dusty subject; every member of the cast and crew give superb performances and I love them for it. Can you tell that I'm a fan? Don't, however, expect anything of the same high standard from the kinda sequel "Hard Core Logo", which I found to be pretty lame indeed. In sum, "Roadkill" rules and, to be honest, no sequel (no matter how 'kinda') could ever do it justice.</p>
