<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Randolph Scott in this film is a man obsessed with revenge. He is the ugly hero and even his loyal sidekick Noah Beery Jr. gets fed up with his obsession. At the same time his unjust cause will make him free the town from a bully (John Carrol)and his gang. It will also prevent a woman (Karen Steele) from making a mistake. For the town he will become a hero but he will hate himself for what he has done. We can compare him with James Stewart in Anthony Mann's "The Naked Spur", which was also an ugly hero. Boetticher knew how to bring out the best of Randolph Scott.He was also great in staging very well the shootouts, as he does here. Even though he was more known for working with Burt Kennedy, he thought Charles Lang, who wrote the screenplay was just as good, as mentioned in his book "When in Disgrace".</p>
