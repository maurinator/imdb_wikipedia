<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In a staid English seaside town after the Second World War, young Lynda grows up with her widowed father and younger sister. Rebellious Lynda has been swearing constantly from an early age. At sixteen, she becomes more exhibitionist and seeks out sexual encounters challenging the prevailing lower-middle class attitudes to sex. She eventually becomes pregnant by an acquaintance of her father.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Excellent acting - particular by Emily Lloyd and Tom Bell.  Clearly Emily Lloyd deserves all the accolades she got for this role.  Tom Bell always gives a performance to remember.  If you love English movies this is one you don't want to miss.  Terrific story line (poignantly funny) and excellent direction.  Wish You Were Here is one to see over and over again...which I have done!  The Brits know how to make this kind of movie using "real" people not plastic "too pretty" Hollywood types.  The story line depicts a generation's morals in a way that generates sympathy for all the characters. Choice of locale, scenery, staging of scenes and clothing worn will stir memories of the time when this story was laid.  The scene in the Tea Room between Emily Lloyd and her father is priceless!</p>
