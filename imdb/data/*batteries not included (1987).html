<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fun movie if you're not looking for heavy philosophy and just want some bubblegum for the eyes.  Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy are brilliant - he as the husband who's watching his wife's mind deteriorate, she as the "living in the past" wife.  My favourite part is when Carlos walks into the hut on top of the building.  The expression on his face when he comes out is priceless.</p>
