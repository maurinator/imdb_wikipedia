<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Considered by many to be the funniest Israeli movie ever made, Hagiga B'Snuker stars Israel's top comedians such as Ze'ev Revach, Yehuda Barkan and Yosef Shiloah. The story is about two twin brothers, Azriel and Gavriel (both played by Yehuda Barkan), who are in no contact with each other, since they live totally different lives. Azriel is a very religious, naive and good-hearted Jew who works in a fruit shop in Jaffa and leads a very religious life. Gavriel, on the other hand, is a hoodlum and a good-for-nothing hustler who together with his friend Hanuka (Ze'ev Revach) runs a Snooker Bar. Gavriel and Hanuka make easy money by swindling innocent people into gambling on Snooker games. One day Gavriel is forced to renew contact with his brother, because he is in trouble with the mafia, and the only way to pay them off is by selling the family estate which is co-owned by Gavriel and his brother Azriel. Accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack by Matti Caspi, this movie provides a very humoristic view of the clash of cultures in Israel between religious and secular Jews. The dialogs and scenes in this movie are so funny, that you may actually pee in your pants the first time you see it. This movie is considered a cult movie in Israel, to the extent that, living in Israel, once in a while, you may bump into a person so deeply effected by this movie, that every other sentence that comes out of his mouth is a quote from Hagiga B'Snuker.</p>
