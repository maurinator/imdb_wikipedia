<h1>Whore (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The prostitute Liz works on the streets of Los Angeles. She recalls her life in flashback, when she marries an alcoholic man. She leaves him with their son. Then she works as waitress in a diner until the day a man introduces her to prostitution. Later she is raped by at least five men and the pimp Blake "protects" her. Liz tries to escape from Blake and befriends the prostitute Katie; however Blake chases her. On the streets, she befriends the homeless Rasta (Antonio Fargas) that helps her when she needs.</p>
<p>This choppy melodrama investigates the life of a prostitute in a pseudo-documentary style. The bottom line of the film is that a life of a hooker isn't easy...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is based on a British stage play and has been adapted to an American setting.  The critics hated this flick but I thought it was great.  It's not for everyone but I found it to be a good character study with humor, sex, and all the other elements of fun sleaze that make a Ken Russell film so much raunchy fun.  I like the character of Rasta and I haven't liked Ms. Russell in another movie before or since.  Porn star Ginger Lynn Allen does a cameo as does cult actor Jack Nance.  Go see 'Whore'.  Even if you can't say it.</p>
