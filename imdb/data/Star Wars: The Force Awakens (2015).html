<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>A scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) enlist the help of legendary smugglers/freedom fighters Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of long lost Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to General Leia Organa of the Resistance before it falls into the hands of Kylo Ren and the First Order.</p>
<p>When critical information is placed into a simple droid, both the evil First Order and the heroic Resistance go searching for it. Then something neither of them planned for happens: Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku finds the droid and keeps it as her own. Finn, an ex-stormtrooper who hopes to leave his past behind him, crosses paths with her and breaks the news of what exactly the importance of the droid is. Next thing either of them know is that they are on the run in order to withhold the droid from the First Order. They meet a pair of old buddies and after a few skirmishes between them and the determined First Order, the droid is brought to the Resistance base. There, multiple plans are hatched against the First Order while the secret information on the droid is slowly and surely working itself out...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Under Disney ownership and with hacks such as JJ Abrams (with creative input from Simon Pegg...God help us) at the helm now, unfortunately Star Wars has been reduced to yet another Transformers/Marvel mindless action, zero plot franchise designed purely to reach the widest possible audience. The legacy of the iconic characters of the OT (particularly Luke) have been reduced to the point of them being almost unrecognizable losers. The previous six film story arc has been completely undermined to say the least and the mystique and nature of the Force simplified, dumbed down and instant.The endless coincidences, JJs nonsensical, deus ex machina story, riddled with plot holes, absurd pacing and editing (which explains John Williams difficulty to nail the score), lack of character development/backstory, so on and so on. The bastardization of SW universe laws and the basic fact that this was supposed to be Episode VII in a seamless saga, but instead we were coned and sold a forgettable reboot was utterly unforgivable. But alas it's a huge commercial hit and the mob sing its praises. But without Lucas, it's just spaceships and lasers.</p>
