<h1>Biloxi Blues (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A New York City teenager named Eugene Jerome enlists in the US Army during the last year of World War II in 1945. Eugene is sent to basic training at Biloxi, Mississippi where he must live with a variety of fellow soldiers from all walks of life while also enduring the whims of a mentally unstable drill sergeant.</p>
<p>New York intellectual Eugene Morris Jerome starts military service thoughtfully, yet patriotically prepared to part-take in World War II. In boot-camp at Biloxi, Mississippi, he faces the brutally opposed views of other recruits, especially the less-educated. Still they must bind, if not bond, facing the sadistic instructor during their physically ruthless and mentally abusive training, which is heading for tragedy. Meanwhile, their boyish minds wander often to sexual frustrations, from obsession with potency (and 'escaping' virginity) to prejudice against gays.</p>
<p>Based on Neil Simon's play of the same name, "Biloxi Blues" is the sequel to Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs." It takes up with the story of Eugene Jerome as he is on his way to boot camp in Mississippi to train for WWII. He learns the hardships of war through boot camp, to accept other people's differences, falls in love and loses his virginity to a prostitute. He and the other young men must endure the rigorous training and abuse from their drill sergeant played by Christopher Walken.</p>
<p>A group of young recruits go through boot camp during the Second World War in Biloxi Mississippi. From the play by Neil Simon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well I'm disappointed. :-(  This film deserves much more than a 6.6 rating! If you watch Brighton Beach Memoires you will love this film. Personally the 1st film was better but maybe because I could relate to a younger Jerome. But this film, oh yes! Christopher Walken you are my GOD! He is so funny in this film in my view! The way he makes the wise-cracking Jerome (Broderick) and fellow NY boy Epstein (Corey) is great. Ok he is a nut but that is Walken- he would be the worst Army officer I would want! Great film- the scene with the 'escort' is great! "You're not breathing! Breathe!" Unbelievable! It is also heart-warming and I love it! Overall I must give it a 8.5/10. Give it a try dont let the 6.6 rating fool you! HO NO!</p>
