<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie when I was 10 years old. It was a double feature at the movie theater with The Beatles "Help!". I guess the saying "You had to be there" comes into place. I loved it. But I also have always loved Herman Hermits. Yes, it is a little corny but, what comedy movie from the 60's wasn't? "Help" was also corny but it is a cult classic! Anyone that ever liked Herman Hermits and Shelly Fabreas will want to see it.The acting isn't great but it does have several known people from those days. I have been trying to obtain this movie for my collection for years and now I see it is out on DVD. I will be getting it soon! Would love to get it on VHS tape if anyone knows where to get it. The fact that it is out on DVD must mean there are several people that want it too!</p>
