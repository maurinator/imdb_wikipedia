<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>SMOKESCREEN is a rather endearing little British thriller with a strong comic flavour to allow it to stand out from the rest. Although it has the same low budget, ensemble cast feel as many other films from Butcher's Film Studios, it's the comic angle - which centres around the central character's miserliness - which makes it special.The storyline is rather familiar, but the Brighton locations give it an edge. The dependable Peter Vaughan plays an insurance investigator who investigates the death of a man who died when his burning car went over the cliffs. To this end, he's teamed up with a youthful John Carson (PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES) as his assistant and must get to grips with the dead man's wife, played by the glamorous Yvonne Romain (CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF). Meanwhile, familiar faces from British movies like Gerald Flood and Sam Kydd regularly appear.SMOKESCREEN comes across as a rather genteel whodunit, playing out like a simple murder mystery with a big 'reveal' at the climax. All aspects of the film are ordinary apart from the comic streak, which is very well handled and genuinely funny. It's this comedy that makes SMOKESCREEN worth watching.</p>
