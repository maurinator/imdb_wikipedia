<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Last Woman On Earth" moves along at a steady clip and has an exciting ending (with a disappointing conclusion).  It is a film that benefits from smart writing, an on location shoot, and an interesting meshing of script with Jazzy soundtrack. There is an underwater scene that was quite excellently filmed. For that matter, the whole film was quite excellently filmed.  Even though this film predates the first James Bond film, it has a bit of a "Dr. No" feel to it.  No, it is no "Dr. No", but neither was its budget a Bond budget. You're not missing much if you never see "Last Woman On Earth", but if you do see it you won't feel like you wasted 71 minutes of your life.  It's a pretty good film -- a sad little tale about good and evil.</p>
