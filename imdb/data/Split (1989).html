<h1>Split (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sci-fi story about a man (Timothy Dwight) on the run from a Big Brother-like security force.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie is idiotic and is obviously geared towards persons who are into using drugs. The part at the end where he has some kind of petry dish that he is trying to put in the water - and then, the LSD-like effects over the film with the echoing of "Things are changing?" Is it some type of twisted, drug-using radical 'fantasy'? of the main character possibly putting a psychotropic or hallucinogenic drug in the water supply of that city in the movie? It's mad, in fact, maddening. Throw this movie in the trash where it belongs with the drugs the makers used while making it.FYI: LSD was synthesized in 1937 by a Swiss chemist. The monster Hitler, in the monster's bunker, actually used a multitude of psychotropic drugs, possibly including LSD.</p>
