<h1>Johnny Concho (1956)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this film when I saw it as a kid. I've always enjoyed western with gunmen, quick draws, duels in the dusty streets, who's fastest and so on. And I still do. However when you grow older you get more demanding in some aspects about movies you didn't even notice as a kid.As I recall "Johnny Concho" I have yo agree with some reviewer here that says it's not believable that a whole town will just do what Johnny says and give him whatever he wants just because his brother is a top gunman. Nor it is believable either -and this is my own- that a cowardly man will push the things too far even if his brother is a top gunman. That's mainly what demerits this picture: the plot is hard to swallow.That aside -which is no minor item- "Johnny Concho" has good moments, adequate atmosphere, good photo and more than acceptable performances, that make it a film to see for western fans.</p>
