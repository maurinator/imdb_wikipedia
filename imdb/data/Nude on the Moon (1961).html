<h1>Nude on the Moon (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Huntley and Professor Nichols are able to complete their work on a moon rocket because of an unexpected inheritance. They travel to the moon, but find a lush garden paradise rather than a barren wasteland. They are captured by virtually naked telepathic humanoids and taken in front of the Great Council. The Moon Goddess decides they should be allowed to continue their experiments, and Dr. Huntley begins falling in love with her. Professor Nichols worries about getting Huntley to return to earth.</p>
<p>Two men pilot their own rocket to the moon. They find it inhabited by people wearing briefs. (The people are actually semi-nude on the moon.) The first 25 minutes is dedicated to the two men planning the trip. The next 35 minutes is a type of musical voyeurism. They go home but forget to take the evidence, and no proof that they went anywhere.</p>
<p>A rich rocket scientist organizes an expedition to the moon, which they discover is inhabited by nude women.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I've seen hundreds of B-grade movies and have never seen one as hilariously "bad" as this one! There were parts I laughed harder at (the scientists talking to each other on CB's when they're right next to each other, the topless moongirl who eats the candy bar wrapper instead of the candy bar) than ANY other movie I can think of! Monty Python included!Just to give you a little taste, when they leave Florida in their rocket and land on the moon, the "moon" looks exactly like Florida with palm trees and grass and trees and everything! Too funny for words.If you are an enthusiast of B-grade cinema, I couldn't recommend a film more frighteningly "perfect" in everything movies of this type have to offer! Laughs galore, off-the-wall plot, horrendous scenery and costumes, awful acting... it's amazing!!</p>
