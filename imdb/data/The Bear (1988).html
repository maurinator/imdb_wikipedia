<h1>The Bear (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The director of _Quest for Fire_ creates yet another film in nature with almost no human dialogue in this picturesque story of an orphaned bear cub who is adopted by an adult male bear and must avoid hunters. Bart the Bear stars in this anthropomorphic fantasy.</p>
<p>An orphan bear cub hooks up with an adult male as they try to dodge human hunters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am very fond of this movie. I watched it for first time when I was a very little kid and loved it. Years later, I watched it again and again I was enchanted. This is, in my opinion, the best film about animals ever made. It is very touching, with big emotional power, very beautiful movie. It has moments in which you can cry and moments, in which you can laugh, moments of high tension and moments, in which you feel the harmony of the nature. The bear cub is very, very cute and the big bear is quite formidable. I have such nice memories of this film, I'm very fond of it. I recommend it to everybody - it is a film about life, and there aren't that many of them.I rarely give a full mark, but here I can do it - 10/10.</p>
