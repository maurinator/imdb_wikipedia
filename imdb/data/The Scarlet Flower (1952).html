<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Considering that Beauty and the Beast is such a timeless story and that Russian animation and film-making fascinates me, they were reasons enough to make me want to see The Scarlet Flower. I am so happy I did, because this was a truly beautiful animation and one of my favourites from Russia(and there are some great Russian animations). The animation is rich and elegant, I especially loved the colours and the wonders of the island which contrasted beautifully with the dark haunting colours of the first encounter with the monster. The music is both beautiful and stirring with somewhat at times a Rimsky-Korsakov influence. The dialogue is very literate and noble, the translation is not the best but it doesn't spoil the mood at all. The story is very true in detail and spirit to the Beauty and the Beast story while adding a distinctive Russian flavour to it, much of it was very moving too like the ending and the father's stay on the island/first encounter with the monster were remarkably mysterious. The characters are always engaging, Nastenka is very easy to relate to and I liked the sincerity of the father, and the voice acting is pitched perfectly, I did like that the monster was very foreboding but in an understated sort of way. In conclusion, a true beauty in every way. 10/10 Bethany Cox</p>
