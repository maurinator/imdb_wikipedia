<h1>Serial (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's the end of the '70s. Hippies are assimilating, women are raising their consciousness, and men are becoming confused and ineffectual. Don't expect to be able to keep track of all the names or who's sleeping with whom; the picture very skillfully conveys the hopeless muddle through which the many characters move as they try to Find Themselves.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Serial" is an often uproariously funny satire lampooning the the fad-conscious lives of a group of citizens living in laid-back Marin County California in the late-70s, a small community just across the bay from San Francisco.  Martin Mull plays Harvey Holroyd, an average family man growing increasingly exasperated at the craziness that seems to be surrounding him. The crazes gradually envelop his wife and daughter and his best friend. As he contends with drugs, health foods, sex orgies, new-age shrinks, religious cults and a boss who belongs to a "gay on weekends" motorcycle gang (horror vet Christopher Lee in a very amusing turn), the laughs pile up in fine fashion.There are plenty of sharp, witty one-liners in the script by Rich Eustis & Michael Elias and TV veteran Bill Persky keeps the gags flowing nicely. Martin Mull is first-rate in his role and is surrounded by a fine supporting cast.A thoroughly pleasant and extremely funny satire, very much a reflection of its time.  Well worth searching out!</p>
