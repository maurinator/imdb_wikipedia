<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A classic to many fans of horror and independent cinema, Silent Night Deadly Night definitely wins the award for having the most gorgeous, super nice, hunk of a killer ever on screen!I mean, if this guy came at me with an axe, I wouldn't be running...Robert Brian Wilson, who went on to star in many US soaps, just has you hooked as the beautiful, gentle killer with his W shaped smile that has such good reason to be the way he is, you can't help feel sorry for him.Adding to the tragedy of what he witnessed as a young boy when a guy dressed as Santa killed his parents, comes an evil nun bitch who just makes his life worse, and to be honest, would do the same to anyone!With great 80's flair and drama, the final cherry on top is when the store he works at has him dress as Santa for the Xmas period. Even as his worst nightmare, our hero is sweet enough not to upset his boss and gives it a shot.Unfortunately from here on in, the rest of the community is in for a jolly time as our handsome killer Santa slays his way to mother superior to take revenge on the wicked penguin that taunted him!A classic, yes. Perfect, no. But still highly enjoyable and well worth the watch for any true horror fan...</p>
