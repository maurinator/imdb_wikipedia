<h1>The Magician (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When 'Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater' comes to town, there's bound to be a spectacle. Reading reports of a variety of supernatural disturbances at Vogler's prior performances abroad, the leading townspeople (including the police chief and medical examiner) request that their troupe provide them a sample of their act, before allowing them public audiences. The scientific-minded disbelievers try to expose them as charlatans, but Vogler and his crew prove too clever for them.</p>
<p>1848. Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater is a small Swedish performing troupe that travels throughout Europe. Most of the troupe members are related to its leader, "Dr." Albert Emanuel Vogler. The nature of their shows are largely related to supernatural phenomenon. Because of the assertions made at their performances and the seemingly unscientific nature, some authority figures question whether they should be allowed to perform. That is what happens at their latest stop, where they are summoned to the home of a local merchant, Mr. Egerman, and his wife, so that they can discuss and demonstrate their performance to the authorities, including Dr. Vergerus, the Minister of Health, and Police Superintendent Starbeck, who will decide if the show is fit for public consumption in their town. Dr. Vergerus in particular seems bent on shutting them down especially if the acts in the show cannot be scientifically explained, and thus cause harm to an unsuspecting public. While Vergerus, Starbeck and Egerman are working on their own agenda not fully disclosed, Vogler and his troupe may have a few undisclosed issues of their own, as well as a few tricks up their sleeves to deal with their inquisitors.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater rolls into town and is promptly summoned for a meet with the town big wigs. Hoping to expose all involved in the theatre as charlatans, the disbelievers request a personal show before allowing the show to go public. With very interesting results.There is a belief amongst many Ingmar Begman fans that Ansiktet (The Magician) is far too accessible a piece to be considered one of his greatest pieces. And whilst it does find Bergman more easy to understand for the casual viewer, it's however still complex enough to thrill and niggle the mind in equal measure. Taking two factors that he very much adored, masks and magic, Bergman threads them off into various directions, and in the process testing us the audience as to just what to expect from the story. The mysterious wonder of it all is naturally aided by Bergman's use of light and shadowy trickery, symbols loom heavy without dampening the theme on offer, with nothing of course actually quite being as it seems.As is normally the case under the master director, the cast are uniformally strong. With Gunnar Bjornstrand and Ingrid Thulin particularly standing out. But really this is all about tricks and ideas relating to magic and its blending in with reality. So much so that with the end comes an awakening that we the audience are indeed props in one of Bergman's shows, and that can never be a bad or even an accessible thing.A fascinating picture from a very fascinating director. 8/10</p>
