<h1>High Noon (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On the day he gets married and hangs up his badge, lawman Will Kane is told that a man he sent to prison years before, Frank Miller, is returning on the noon train to exact his revenge. Having initially decided to leave with his new spouse, Will decides he must go back and face Miller. However, when he seeks the help of the townspeople he has protected for so long, they turn their backs on him. It seems Kane may have to face Miller alone, as well as the rest of Miller's gang, who are waiting for him at the station...</p>
<p>In this classic Western, Will Kane, the longtime marshal of Hadleyville in New Mexico territory, has just retired following his marriage with pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a criminal that Kane once sent away to be hanged, has been pardoned and will arrive into town, at high noon, with one thing on his mind: Revenge on the marshal who once ruined his life. With the threat of vengeful outlaws looming, Kane will have to decide whether he honors his sense of duty or his love for his pacifist bride.</p>
<p>Will Kane is a town marshal. It's his wedding day and his last day as a lawman. He was about to leave town with his new bride to start a new life when some men come to town who tell him that a man he sent to prison some years ago has just been released and is arriving on the noon train. Kane and many of the townsfolk who remember him, know that he's coming to town for one thing; to get Will. Will's friends tell him to leave town which he does but Will feeling that running away is not a solution returns and intends to face him. Will tries to find support from his friends but all of them don't want to help him or are too afraid and all that they tell him is to leave, even his wife feels the same way. And as the train comes closer, Will is all alone.</p>
<p>A marshall, personally compelled to face a returning deadly enemy, finds that his own town refuses to help him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>High Noon is for me one of the two finest Westerns ever made (the other is Shane). It is an elemental commentary on the best and worst of America, the best and worst of mankind. It is Greek tragedy and Shakespeare brought to the Old West in a grandly simple form. Gary Cooper is superb and the supporting cast is outstanding as well (although I wish Grace Kelley would have spoken without the artificial sounding school-girl accent, something which marred so many of her otherwise fine performances). I do not read into the film a commentary on events of the 1950s, specifically the ongoing investigations by Congress of left-wing activities. High Noon transcends such specifics as this. I know John Wayne called the film un-American but I must disagree. I have great respect for the Duke but think he got this one wrong. Weak, timid people are everywhere and the strong are often few and far between. Goodness and right often prevail because a small minority insure that they do. All benefit from the courage of the lonely hero whether they realize it or not. Hign Noon is a testimony to this truth.</p>
