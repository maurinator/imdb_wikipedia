<h1>5 Fingers (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a true story. In neutral Turkey during WWII, the ambitious and extremely efficient valet for the British ambassador tires of being a servant and forms a plan to promote himself to rich gentleman of leisure. His employer has many secret documents; he will photograph them, and with the help of a refugee Countess, sell them to the Nazis. When he makes a certain amount of money, he will retire to South America with the Countess as his wife.</p>
<p>During WWII the valet to the British Ambassador to Ankara sells British secrets to the Germans while trying to romance a refugee Polish countess.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another great performance by James Mason - he is wonderful as the brainy, underestimated valet of the British Ambassador to Turkey who feeds invaluable information to the Nazis for a price.  The betrayals and counter-betrayals throughout make this a terrific suspense film.  As usual, I find myself hoping that James Mason will get away with his crimes, even in spite of the despicable nature of his treachery and to whom he is betraying his secrets.  The ending is satisfying in the most perfect way.</p>
