<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The End of Innocence is a masterpiece. Those of you wondering why the title, it was the end of thinking that everything was fine with her life and the realization that the act was no longer going to work, in fact it was killing her. This is the true essence picture of a codependent, doing everything she can to make everyone happy at the expense of her own well being. Such a powerful movie for those growing up in narcissistic families where the parent did not meet the needs of their children but expected the children to meet the needs of the parent.I liked how the movie showed the key parts of her childhood history from birth to the present in a fast paced, entertaining way. The mother was a piece of work, even at birth Stephanie wasn't good enough for being a girl instead of a boy.Dyan looked wonderful, she is such a beautiful lady. Hard to believe she was in her 60's when she made this movie, she looks decades younger.</p>
