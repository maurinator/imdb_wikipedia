<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A zombie from beyond space is found in an English backyard and is invited to stay in with a lesbian couple. The girls dress him up as a woman, which does not seem to affect him in the least, but provides us with a truly strange yet successful film. The story, which borrows from such various sources as THE MAN WHO FELL ON EARTH (Roeg), CUL-DE-SAC (Polanski) and STRAW DOGS (Peckinpah), is clever enough to take on board such themes as racism, sexism, love, jealousy and betrayal. With just three characters, an unusual setting and a fittingly realistic treatment, it makes for a very intriguing experience. Norman J. Warren's best ?</p>
