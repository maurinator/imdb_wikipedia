<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I was reading other users' comments it occurred to me that the film is a "cruel romance". What Nick Cave did with his "Murder Ballads", but on the screen. I believe, the film has something in common with "Night Cowboy", "Knocking on Heaven's Door", but it has neither the raw prose of life of the former, nor the sentimental appeal of the latter. It's meant to be viewed with a touch of irony, a touch of "stepping aside". It's intentionally overdone here and there, but it doesn't spoil the story, it's the mark of the genre. Personally I welcomed this Australian variety of "cruel romance", it's a rest from sickeningly earnest Hollywood stuff.</p>
