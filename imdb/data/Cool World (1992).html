<h1>Cool World (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack Deebs is a cartoonist who is due to be released from jail. His comic book "Cool World" describes a zany world populated by "doodles" (cartoon characters) and "noids" (humanoids). What Jack did't realize is that Cool World really does exist, and a "doodle" scientist has just perfected a machine which links Cool World with our world. Intrigued at seeing his creations come to life, Jack is nonetheless wary as he knows that not everything in Cool World is exactly friendly.</p>
<p>When ex-con cartoonist Jack Deebs was behind bars he found escape by creating "Cool World," a cartoon series featuring a voluptuous vixen named Holli Would. But the 'toonsmith becomes a prisoner of his own fantasies when Holli pulls jack into Cool World with a scheme to seduce him and bring herself to life. A hard-boiled detective--the only other human in Cool World--cautions Jack with the law: 'Noids don't have sex with cartoon doodles. The flesh proves weaker than ink, however, as Holli takes human form in Las Vegas, staring in a trans-universal chase that threatens the destruction of both worlds. With a splashy mix of animation and live-action sequences, "Cool World" delivers the hottest action around.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This ambitious and more adult version of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (1988) has its moments, yet its the very extreme contrasts of the now fading old animation cartoons and live action that carried the movie that with today's computer digital animation would not be possible. The technical seamless nature of the fusion of animation and live action isn't quite as crisp and not quite as effective even in comparison to ROGER RABBIT of four year's earlier. The storyline is clear, the cartoon humor consistently adult, yet the ultimate possibilities and opportunities for a serious use of this media remain untapped. Nevertheless, the effort improves on the basic initial introduction of ROGER RABBIT and the fantasy of comics is well captured and the strongest moment is how the adult relationship in the real world is concluded in the movie that makes this movie stand out from the more typical television episodes or average comedy-drama, though the ending could still have used a bit more sophisticated, layered, and unfinished polish.</p>
