<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This brief glimpse of Marilyn's last work is very interesting.She was trying a new look that actually made her look younger than her fiftie's image. It's strange everyone was talking about her age and an older Doris Day eventually played the part with a bleached white Marilyn do!It's well known Cukor hated the assignment and was determined to use his own script. Marilyn didn't have script approval and had to face Cukor's resentment every day. At least her bouffant sidesweep hair style swept the country,giving Marilyn one last hurrah.Cukor's attitude soured Marilyn on the project.She was anxious to leave Fox and get into better movie deals. Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse made good costars. It's one of those films I wish they had finished.Despite the ugly rumors Marilyn was staggering around in a drugged state,she looks wonderful. If they had to fire anybody it should have been Cukor.</p>
