<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>To their astonishment Boone and Marquette are asked to find James Pike, an escaped serial killer. Normally this is ordinary police business and Lili wonders why it has something to do with Companion security. Pike is no ordinary human being. He drew a mysterious painting with markings that look like the Taelon language with his own blood on the wall of his cell and then died. His physician, Dr. Kaplan, confirmed his death and started an autopsy during his state of rigor mortis. Suddenly Pyke awoke and escaped. When Kaplan does some tests on his blood, he notices a strange anomaly. Boone recognizes it immediately and he pays Da'an a visit to get answers.</p>
