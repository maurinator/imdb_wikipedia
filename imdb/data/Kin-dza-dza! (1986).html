<h1>Kin-dza-dza! (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kin-Dza-Dza is something like an "advanced cyberpunk film". It's a lot about people and social structures which on the planet of "Pluke" of course have many parallels to our society. It's a very funny movie, but it's also a melancholic movie with great philosophical sense.</p>
<p>Two Humans, "Uncle Vova" and "The Fiddler" accidentally find themselves on another planet after pushing the wrong button on the strange device in the hand of an odd hobo, claiming to be an alien. Planet "Pluke" in the galaxy "Kin-Dza-Dza" looks like a desert. All "aliens" look human, and can understand Russian, after reading uncle Vova's mind. Their own language is mostly telepathic and is limited to 11 words - 10 plus "koo" - all other words. The whole paradox of Pluke is that their civilization is much more advanced than ours in time and space traveling, weaponry and so on, but totally barbarian in the social way. There is a special (and only) way to identify two groups of creatures by pointing a little device on the person, orange light - "Chatlanian" (superior), green - "Patsak" (lower class). The most valued things on the planet are matches (or, rather, the chemicals ordinarily used on Earth for match heads). One match head equals to 2200 "chatles". Uncle Vova and Gedevan "the Fiddler" Alexidze, have a long and dangerous journey in order to get home...</p>
<p>Two Russians push the wrong button on a strange device and end up on the telepathic planet Pluke with its strange societal norms.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Georgiy Daneliya created one of the brightest "anti-utopia" films in the history of cinema. Modesty of decorations with the interest is completed by the imagination of director and by the bright game of actors. "Keen-dza-dza" occurs the complex and multidimensional peace, which lives according to its, sufficiently simple and intelligible laws.The inhabitants of the planet "Plyuk" have long ago mastered intergalactic overflights, but their lexical reserve consists in all of two words. But the system of authority and subordination is reduced to the color of pants, which you bear, and what flame lights up on the small machine - green or orange.There is another extreme: the highly developed inhabitants of alpha convert their neighbors into the plants, because "by them so it is better". In both cases - possible future of humanity, without the bright specials-effect, but complete of humor, irony and sarcasm.</p>
