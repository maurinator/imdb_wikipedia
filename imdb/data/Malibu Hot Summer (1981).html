<h1>Malibu Hot Summer (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>John Logan is a poor little rich boy. He learns to love from three nubile L.A. newcomers that will do anything to be introduced into the sizzling nightlife of the City of Angels. Portraying the Malibu beach life by day, and the L.A. club life by night, Sizzle Beach U.S.A. is a stunning insiders critique on the sex and drug lifestyle of the West Coast swinger scene in the early 80s.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have decided to watch every kevin Costner movie in order. So I start here with his debut. Malibu Hot Summer or Sizzle Beach USA as its called on my DVD. Plot In A Paragraph: 3 female friends (One wants to become an actress, one wants to be a singer, and the other wants to be a gym teacher) go to stay at a beach house for the summer. There are a lot of naked beauties in the movie, and I'm sure a few people still get a kick out of the 1970's soft core porn movie vibe. But it's one to miss.Kevin Costner is given a Special Guest Star Billing, and is in it quite a bit. He plays a cowboy who falls in love with the actress. But truthfully he gives the impression he is reading his lines from a none to helpful prompt book.</p>
