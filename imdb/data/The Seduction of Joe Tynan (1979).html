<h1>The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Respected liberal Senator Joe Tynan is asked to lead the opposition to a Supreme Court appointment. It means losing an old friend and fudging principles to make the necessary deals, as well as further straining his already part-time family life. But it could be a big boost to his career, so he takes it on. Helping him prepare the case is pretty southern researcher Karen Traynor, and their developing relationship further complicates and compromises his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Strong drama of morals and ambition. Alda has written himself a showcase part and does very well in the lead providing a strong center to the picture and he's aided by two superior actresses, one, Meryl Streep, on the way up and the other Barbara Harris always under-appreciated. Meryl is vulnerable and appealing but Barbara Harris is the treasure, giving the film's best performance and providing the heart that would be missing with her contribution. An incredibly skillful actress who was too unique for Hollywood to utilize properly she speaks volumes without saying a word through subtle facial expression. Also notable is Melvyn Douglas giving another of the marvelous supporting performances that were a staple of the twilight of his career.</p>
