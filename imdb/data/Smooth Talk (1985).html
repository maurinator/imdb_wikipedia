<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Smooth Talk" spends the first half of its run time developing the Dern character, showing her to be a typically (more or less)  rebellious, angst-filled, brittle teen who is just discovering boys and dating when an unexpected encounter with a smooth talker (Williams) forces her to take a quantum leap toward maturity. A simple little serious-minded indie with a thin story and not so thin message, "SM" is a slow starter with a solid performance by Dern which will likely be most appreciated by females. B-</p>
