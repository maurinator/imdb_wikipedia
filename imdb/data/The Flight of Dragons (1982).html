<h1>The Flight of Dragons (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is an animated movie based on the book by Peter Dickinson. In this movie the realm of magic is being threatened by the realm of logic, so Carolinus, the green wizard decides to shield it for all time. Ommedon, the evil red wizard, stands in his way. Carolinus then calls for a quest that is to be led by a man named Peter Dickinson, who is the first man of both the realms of science and magic. It is Peter's job to defeat Ommedon.</p>
<p>Faced with the inevitable replacement of magic by science, the magician Carolinus summons his 3 brothers (all magicians) to pitch a wild plan. The creation of a realm of magic to exist separate and apart from the world of man, where all things magical can be protected. 2 of Carolinus' brothers buy into the plan and offer their assistance. However one brother Ommadon rebels refusing to join this retirement village. Ommadon has another plan in mind, he wants to take the fight directly to man hoping to use their science against them. Prevented from direct interference, the 3 brothers arrange a quest to defeat Ommadon. A quest championed by a local knight Sir Orin Neville Smythe, the dragons Gorbash and Smrgol, and a yet unknown leader who must be a man of science. Calling out to antiquity, Carolinus locates Peter Dickenson, a modern day man of science and manages to convince him to join and lead the quest. However, a spell gone awry creates additional challenges for Peter, huge ones for that matter. What ensues is a wondrous adventure full of interesting characters, challenges, and perils that will cumulate in a face off between Peter and Ommadon. This story combines the literary works of Gordon R. Dickson's "The Dragon and the George" for core characters and themes, Peter Dickinson's "The Flight of Dragons" for the design of dragons and mechanics of dragon flight, and writer Romeo Muller who brings in the science verses magic angle as well as the romantic sub-plot.</p>
<p>A young Boston writer goes back in time into an era where wizards and dragon reign and science is just barely known.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not much for animation usually but this film changed all that. I first watched it when I was younger and until recently hadn't watched it for a while. But after seeing it again it gave me a hunger again and again. If you're into the mystical, fantasy escapism in films and if you love dragons and wizards then this is a definite must see. It has beautifully designed beasts (dragons, ogres, worms etc) not just in design but in naming and essence which is definitely worthy of the book by Peter Dickinson. I'm a complete dragon lover now and love nothing more than watching a film that drops you into a fantasy pool through narrative and colour. And if you're the kind of person who likes a good musical soundtrack to go with, then this is a definite yes. This should be seen by children and adults alike. It's definitely one of my favourites and after you've seen it I'm sure it'll be yours too!</p>
