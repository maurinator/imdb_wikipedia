<p>Dean Jones plays a race car driver who meets a pretty young woman (Michelle Lee) he sees working in the window at a fancy car dealership. He pretends to be interested in a car, but the dealer has nothing he can afford.  Well, actually, that's not true.  There is one little Volkswagen Beetle that was purchased by a woman who also bought a Bentley. She bought it for her maid but brought it back because the car misbehaved.  Jones isn't interested in the car, but it follows him home.  Cops show up at his place accusing him of stealing the car, which of course he didn't.  Jones blames the sleazy car dealer for this, and for the strange behavior the car exhibits when he tries to drive it.  The car has a mind of its own, and its special qualities make it good for racing.  A romance develops between Jones and Lee when Lee tries to convince Jones the car is normal but soon finds out the truth.  Lee can't stand Jones at first, of course. Eventually Jones decides to keep the car and race it, but the car dealer wants in on the action, offering to buy this special car.  Jones won't sell to him, but he eventually sells to a Mr. Wu (some people may be offended by stereotypical portrayals of Chinese people, and Wu starts out as a stereotype but later seems quite sophisticated).  The car dealer tries his best to keep Herbie from being a success.Jones and Lee did well in their parts but they seemed like they were acting.  Buddy Hackett was quite good as an artist who creates works out of car parts and later served as Jones' crew.  Hackett named the car Herbie because it reminded him of his uncle.  And the actor playing the car dealer was delightfully evil.  The special effects were amazing for the era in which the movie was made.  It really looked like the car could do some amazing things. And of course the car seemed to have a personality, one that made us like it.  The racing scenes were quite well done, and it's hard to believe there were not more wrecks.  Maybe the cars were filmed at slower speeds than what we saw.  While quite funny, the movie also had its tender moments and could even be sad:  Herbie tried to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, for example.  I didn't really see anything to concern parents, though maybe it was a little violent for the littlest ones.</p>
