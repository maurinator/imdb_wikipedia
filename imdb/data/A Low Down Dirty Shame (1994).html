<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was so funny! Peaches (Jada Pinkett) and Shame (Keenen Ivory Wayans) made a good team. There were so many funny scenes especially when Shame had 3 dogs chasing him and he started singing a song by James Brown and he woke up in bed with a guy in his bed. Oh also my favorite part was when, Peaches punched out a soap opera actor because his character had sex with one of the other characters that she didn't like. There are so many other funny parts in this move. I'm hoping that Wayans will consider making a sequel to this movie. I wonder what Peaches and Shame will be up to next. If you haven't seen this movie yet, rent it and you won't be disappointed.</p>
