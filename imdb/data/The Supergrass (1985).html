<h1>The Supergrass (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>While taking a holiday in the country with his mother, Dennis hits on a scheme to impress a girl so that she'll go away on a trip with him as his girlfriend. Although he fails to gain any interest from the girl, the police take a great interest in his story. From this point on, Dennis digs a deeper hole for himself at every turn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first feature-length movie by the guys from The Comic Strip,The Supergrass feels like it's just a longer episode. Adrian Edmonson's character tells a girl he's a drug smuggler(which is a lie) and gets busted by the police.They tell him if he becomes a narc(grass in British slang) they will drop the charges,so he tries to help them bust 2 smugglers played by Nigel Planer and Keith Allen. If you like The Comic Strip Presents,you will like this. I would recommend this to all fans of comedy but if you have trouble with English accents or slang, it may be hard to understand some stuff.Not to mention all the dated British pop culture references that even younger Brits would probably not get. If you think you have a good sense of humor,watch it.</p>
