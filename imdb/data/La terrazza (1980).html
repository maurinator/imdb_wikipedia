<h1>La terrazza (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Expensive vines, tables filled with food, but emptiness inside. Everyone has stopped developing, and fastened in their roles. Hurtful, but still funny story about human development.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Adorable, intelligent and politic driven movie. The best Italian director ever commands great actors and conducts the audience through a journey of passionate and bitter fellows who dare to fight for their beliefs. In La Terrazza there are some amazing speeches - which I don't recall exactly - about every human being's right to happiness and love.Maybe I liked it so much because I'm already a big fan of Ettore Scola. I also recommend his masterpieces "C'eravamo Tanto Amati" (the best Victorio Gassman performance) and "La Cena" (the last Gassman appearance).</p>
