<h1>Veronica Guerin (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on a true story, this is about the Irish journalist Veronica Guerin (Cate Blanchett), a reporter for The Sunday Independent, who exposed some of Dublin's most powerful crime barons and drug lords in 1996. But later that year she was gunned down by assasins hired by the same criminal drug lords she exposed.</p>
<p>All Irish know where they were on 26 June 1996 when they learned that crusading journalist Veronica Guerin had been gunned down on Dublin's Naas Road. The film starts with her assassination and looks back at what brought it on. For more than 18 months, she'd been digging into and writing about Dublin's drug trade, starting with the youths who were hooked and working up to the big dealers. As she gets close to the biggest crook, John Gilligan, she's given a warning shot, a gunshot wound, a beating, and a threat against her young son. Her husband and mother try to dissuade her, as does a key informant, double-dealing John Traynor. What drives her on - idealism, the chase, fame?</p>
<p>An Irish journalist writes a series of stories about drug dealers.</p>
