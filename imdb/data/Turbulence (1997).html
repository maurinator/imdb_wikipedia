<h1>Turbulence (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ryan Weaver romances beautiful women before he kills them. Ryan is arrested, convicted, and is part of a Christmas Eve transfer of prisoners on a transcontinental 747 commercial flight. Other airlines at JFK may have holiday passengers waiting on stand-by, but this jumbo jet takes off with a lot of empty seats. Ryan and another prisoner overpower and kill their guards. The few civilian passengers are herded into a "pantry" on the plane and are not seen again until the end of the movie. Ryan eliminates the other prisoners and all the crew members except Teri Halloran. The remainder of the movie follows a "cat-and-mouse" game between Ryan and Teri on the 747.</p>
<p>Ryan Weaver is a serial killer who is known as the Lonely Hearts Strangler. Ryan was raised by his aunt, who disappeared 19 years ago when Ryan was 16-years-old. Two years ago, Ryan was convicted of raping and killing 5 women in the Los Angeles area, and Ryan was sentenced to be executed, but on his way to the prison, Ryan escaped. For the two years since the escape, Los Angeles cop Aldo Hines has been after Ryan. In New York City, Aldo finally finds Ryan, and Ryan is prepared to be extradited to Los Angeles. Two days later, on Christmas Eve, TransCon Airlines flight 7 takes off with four U.S. Marshals on the airplane guarding Ryan and another convict named Stubbs. While the airplane is over Akron, Ohio, Stubbs kills all four of the marshals. Ryan then grabs a gun and kills Stubbs. During this melee, pilot Matt Powell and co-pilot Ted Kary are both killed, leaving the autopilot to fly the airplane, and Ryan takes the airplane hostage. Flight attendant Teri Halloran rushes to the cockpit, where she radios the nearest control tower and is patched through to Tower Airlines pilot Samuel Bowen, who tries to help her as Ryan repeatedly tries to kill her.</p>
<p>After a shootout on a flight transporting prisoners, a stewardess must outwit a smooth-talking serial killer and land the plane herself.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict.Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict.Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters.Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!!Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!</p>
