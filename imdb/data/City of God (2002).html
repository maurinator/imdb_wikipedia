<p>During their childhood, several children raised in one of the violent neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro see galling and nettlesome behaviors that turn some into criminals and some into poltroons; while one photographer boy in the middle stays out of their informal war until it's finished and then narrates the complicated story of what happened in that neighborhood and the ascending process of crime between men who were once innocent children.</p>
<p>City of God is based on a true story that takes place in the '60s where in the slums of Rio de Janeiro two boys growing up in the neighborhood take on different paths in life. The story is told through the eyes of Buscape, a poor young fisherman's son who dreams of becoming a photographer one day. His story narrates the violence and corruption surrounding the city and the rise and fall of one of the city's most notorious bosses, Li'l Ze. As war wages on the streets Buscape's only way out of this violent life is to expose its brutality to the world through his pictures. Along the way the lives of others are put into perspective as their stories intersect with the events that take place.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those "based on a true story" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film.</p>
