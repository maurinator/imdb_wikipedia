<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good entertainer.Revenge drama with a simple storyline.Anil Kapoor at his dashing stylish best. Amrish Puri equally good.Support cast good to their roles. Nutan as the mother, Javed Jaffrey for dancing. Meenakshi Sheshadri is only in this for the beauty factor.Simple storyline, and indeed proof that Subhash Ghai really created good movies in the 80's.One of the few Subhash Ghai movies that does not slow in between, keeps up a good pace.Credit also should go to the good editing.Climax fight could have been better..</p>
