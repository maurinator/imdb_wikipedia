<h1>Varsity Blues (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In small-town Texas, high school football is a religion. The head coach is deified, as long as the team is winning and 17-year-old schoolboys carry the hopes of an entire community onto the gridiron every Friday night. In his 35th year as head coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) is trying to lead his West Canaan Coyotes to their 23rd division title. When star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) suffers an injury, the Coyotes are forced to regroup under the questionable leadership of John Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a second-string quarterback with a slightly irreverent approach to the game. "Varsity Blues" explores our obsession with sports and how teenage athletes respond to the extraordinary pressures places on them.</p>
<p>In the town of West Canaan, Texas, football is a way of life but for Jonathan "Mox" Moxon(James Van Der Beek), he has just about enough of it. Pressured by his father to play since childhood, Mox has barely ever seen some football action being a second string quarterback. But after the first string quarterback Lance Harbor(Paul Walker), is seriously injured, Mox is brought in to finish the season and win Coach Bud Kilmer's(Jon Voight) district championship. Mox begins to realize the toughness and hardship of being a starter, but with tough things comes rewards and to Mox's suprise he finds out that him being starter brings more than he can handle, like popularity, women, etc.</p>
<p>A back-up quarterback is chosen to lead a Texas football team to victory after the star quarterback is injured.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Varsity Blues is a very predictable football drama that is very similar in tone and style to 2004's Friday Night Lights. While I like that film better, this is not a bad film at all. I was still able to root for and against some characters. This movie does a good job at holding my attention and bringing back some good high school memories.Brian Robbin's film is about a Texas football team in the town of West Canaan. After the star quarterback is injured, the back up guy, Moxon is forced to deal with his relentless coach Kilmer, his disapproving girlfriend, and his football-loving parents while starting in his new role that is all strange for him.The acting is pretty good. This is the first time I saw James Van Der Beek on film because I refuse to watch Dawson's Creek, but he does a pretty good job. Jon Voight gives a masterful performance as Kilmer and he just made me despise the character. Paul Walker does a good job and he does not even drive any cars! Overall, this may be a clich√©d sports film, but there are some subtle differences such as scenes involving whipped cream, religious little brothers, and a health teacher who is much more than that. Despite some flaws, I couldn't help but root for the Moxon kid. I rate this film 9/10.</p>
