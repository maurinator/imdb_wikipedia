<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I guess Albert Brooks' comedy is not for everybody.  His sense of humor is based on being loud, antisocial, sarcastic and incredibly neurotic.  And that's why our senses of humor are on par with one another.  I love that type of humor!  And what's more amusing about his comedy is he almost never cracks a smile.  Some comic actors feel the need be goofy in order to be funny.  I don't believe comedy works that way.  I believe the more serious you are in a scene, the funnier you are.  As a matter of fact, comic actors need to be more serious in scene than dramatic actors.  And Brooks is dead serious in portraying his characters.  It's the fact that he's ranting and raving like a maniac, while keeping a straight face, that makes the scenes incredibly hilarious.  So for everyone who's a fan of his comedy, you should feel right at home.  There's tons of hilarious lines and tons of hilarious gags.  Of course the story is predictable, like most sports movies, so don't expect any big surprises.  And I felt Brendan Fraser's character was underwritten.  But just see the movie for Albert Brooks.  You should have a wonderful time!  I can't wait to see his next movie, "The Wedding Party," where he co-stars with Michael Douglas.  I just saw the trailer this weekend.  My score:  8 (out of 10)</p>
