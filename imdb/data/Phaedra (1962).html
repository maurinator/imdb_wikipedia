<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I had seen Phaedra once when I was young many moons ago and just recently obtained a bootleg copy of the film on video. What can I say. It left a lasting impression with me once again. Powerhouse acting from Raf Vallone, Melina Mercouri and Tony Perkins. Superbly directed in the tragic tradition of Greek tale. From beginning to end it will capture your emotions in a whirlwind tale of forbidden love and the horrific consequences of its persuit. The dark ending charges me up every time I see it. If you can get your hands on this film-don't pass it up. You won't be dissapointed. As a matter of fact-this picture should be lobbied for release on home video. It's simply too good a film to be lost in the archives.</p>
