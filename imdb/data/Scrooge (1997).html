<h1>Scrooge (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A retelling of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>_Ms._Scrooge_ is a remake of Charles Dickens' _A_Christmas_Carol_.  If you are tired of Scrooge as a crotchety old English guy, you can now see the same story modernized with an elderly black woman playing Scrooge.  The adaption is well done, and the contrast with the original story is part of the fun.Cicely Tyson plays Scrooge.  I first noticed her years ago in the movie _Autobiograpy_of_Miss_Jane_Pittman_.  That award-winning movie and _Ms._Scrooge_ together make an interesting set.  In both, Cicely is shown at different times of her life to develop a personal history of how she became who she is now.  While the _Autobiography_ is a better movie, _Ms._Scrooge_ is still very good.The supporting cast does an excellent job.  Perhaps Katherine Helmund goes over the top as Maude Marley, and she appears to be enjoying her state more than one would think a lost soul should.  Still, she effectively sets the stage for what Scrooge is yet to experience.  Julian Richings is totally eery as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.  Roles where actors don't speak have got to be hard to play, but Julian finds the way.</p>
