<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At the height of the Cold War and the HUAC hearings, government employee Bernie Goldsmith (Borgnine) is summarily fired. He discovers, to his horror, that he's suspected of being a Communist. Ostracized by most of his community, he hires a lawyer and fights the charges. The other two brave men of the title are his lawyer (Milland) and a representative of the military (Lovejoy) who stand up for him. The film depicts the trauma Goldsmith and his family go through in the efforts to clear themselves. Based on a newspaper story, the film is an interesting attempt to deal with the blacklist issue circa late 1956 when it was produced.</p>
