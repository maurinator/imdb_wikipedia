<h1>Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Time travellers from the 23rd century return to 1992 to warn Japan that Godzilla will cause a catastrophic nuclear incident in the 21st century and suggest a way to rid the world of him forever. They intend to go back to 1944, to Ragos Island, where a dinosaur was exposed to radiation from the Bikini H-Bomb test and became Godzilla. Upon completion of this task, King Ghidrah appears in 1992 and the visitors' true plan is discovered. They wish to destroy Japan so it will not become the dominant economic force. Luckily for the Japanese, Godzilla was still created and will now fight Ghidrah.</p>
<p>In this sequel to Godzilla vs. Biollante, time-travellers from the future warn that Japan will ultimately be destroyed if the monster Godzilla can't be neutralized. They reveal the circumstances of Godzilla's origin: a dinosaur who survived into the 20th Century (and who inadvertently saved a group of Japanese soldiers from American forces during World War II), only to be mutated by atomic testing on his island home. The future people have an audacious plan: to remove the pre-Godzilla dinosaur from his timestream and prevent his mutation. However, things take an unexpected turn, resulting in the creation of a new horror--the three- headed dragon King Ghidrah.</p>
<p>Time travelers use Godzilla in their scheme to destroy Japan to prevent the country's future economic reign.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film came to my attention when I attended the first Monsterama Con in 2014 in Atlanta. One of the honored guests was Robert Scott Field who played an android. According to Fields, this film has been recognized as the third best Godzilla movie of all time. In Japan it received the equivalent to our Oscar Award. This film delves back to the origin of Godzilla and the epic battle with his equal King Ghidorah. The future visitors to modern 1990 Japan warn of destruction and want to change the course of the future but manipulating the present. A fun use of old school special effects and fun to see movies made pre- CGI. This movie is a joy for any Godzilla enthusiast. His name is Godzilla!</p>
