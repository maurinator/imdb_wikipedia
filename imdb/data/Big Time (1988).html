<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I was first introduced to the music of Mr. Tom Waits back in college in 1990 when one of my friends would sing The Train Song from Frank's Wild Years whenever he got drunk. In short order I actually heard it performed on Frank's Wild Years along with the rest of the album and was an instant Tom Waits addict. Within 6 months I had bought up all of his music that I could find, and my love for his bluesy, irreverent and hypnotic style has never left me in the last 18 years. But I have never seen him live and until very recently I had only seen the one video-made for "In the Neighborhood" from Swordfish Trombones. And while I have wanted to see "Big Time" for some time, I've never managed to get hold of a copy...until today when I received a used VHS copy in the mail and put it straight in the VCR (ASIDE: is it just me or do other fans feel a good DVD release of this film is in order?).I wasn't sure what to expect, but I figured I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't. The film manages to convey the mood, atmosphere and showmanship that I hear in Tom Wait's music. Haunting, strange and hypnotic, I was entranced by this film and loved the music included, Mr. Wait's banter with the audience and the visual imagery and use of different camera angles and editing.Really I just liked the overall personal feel to this and strongly recommend it to fans of the master. If you're not a fan and have already been exposed to Tom Waits, then this is not likely to change your mind. If you've never had the experience and pleasure of his music, then give this one a chance-you never know, you might love it.</p>
