<h1>The Angry Red Planet (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The first spaceship to Mars, presumed lost, is found in space and brought back to Earth by remote control. Only two from an initial crew of four are still alive, but one is unconscious due to an attached alien growth, while the other is traumatized, blocking out all memory of what happened. In hopes to save the unconscious crewman, the amnesiac is interrogated back into remembering. Those in charge thereby learn of the terrible dangers awaiting anyone venturing into the spooky, ruddy stillness of the very alien Martian ecosystem.</p>
<p>A rocket ship returns from Mars. Contact was lost since the ship arrived on Mars. Now the crew does not answer any radio messages from mission control. The people from mission control try to land the rocket ship by remote control and investigate what happened on Mars.</p>
<p>After disappearing without a trace and being given up for lost, a manned probe to Mars is observed returning to Earth but will not respond to any contact. After mission control risks an automated landing, they find that there are only two survivors, one critically injured and with some strange growth on his arm. Doctors turn to the other surviving astronaut, Iris Ryan, for answers, and discover the Martians' angry warning which, to paraphrase, would be, "You Earth kids stay out of my yard!"</p>
<p>Our first manned flight to Mars returns after being thought lost in space. Only two survivors (Mohr & Hayden) of the original four are on board. Mohr has a green growth on his arm, and nothing that the doctors do will kill it. Hayden, under hypnosis, tells of their adventures on Mars. Thought to be a dead planet, it's inhabited with man-eating plants, giant Bat-Rat-Spider-Crab monsters, a strange city on a lake, and a one-eyed monster that dissolves anything that it swallows or touches.</p>
<p>One of only two survivors from a Martian expedition is so traumatized she doesn't remember the circumstances of the trip.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"The Angry Red Planet" will be a treat for anyone who admires sci-fi flicks from the '50s and early '60s. Basically, a group of astronauts travels to Mars looking for life. They find an over-sized being which appears to be a cross between a rat and a spider. And the Munchkin mayor from "The Wizard of Oz".I guess that there's nothing particularly unique about this movie; that era yielded many movies about people finding things in outer space. But like I said, if you have a special affinity for old-fashioned B-movies, then this is the movie for you. Watching the DVD with Spanish subtitles makes it even more interesting.</p>
