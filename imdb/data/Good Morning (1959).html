<h1>Good Morning (1959)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie takes a look at a Westernized suburban area in Japan in the late '50s. It focuses mainly on the daily lives of a small community and the way its members interact. It also demonstrates the power of oral communication and the way in which small talk acts as a lubricant for our daily lives.</p>
<p>Adolescent brothers Minoru and Isamu Hayashi live with their parents and aunt in a suburban housing complex on the outskirts of Tokyo. Because of the close quarters within the housing complex, all the neighbors get along well, although gossip does spread quickly amongst the housewives and amongst the men at the bar. Because of the friendly nature of the neighbors, Minoru, Isamu and their two friends, Kôzô and Zennosuke, who also live in the complex, will often go over to one neighbor's house, they who have the only television set in the complex. Despite the boys insistence they get one for their own house, Mr. and Mrs. Hayashi refuse to buy a television, due to the cost and believing it to be the downfall of Japanese society. In an argument with the boys over the issue, Mr. Hayashi accuses the boys of making too much noise while having their tantrum. The boys, in return and in protest, decide to go a "silence" strike, not only against their parents, but also any adult including their aunt, their neighbors and their teachers. This silent treatment causes many misunderstandings, especially among the housewives about some missing money. Will the boys get their way and if so will it be because of their protest? Regardless of the outcome, the process of dealing with the boys assists in drawing two of the adults in the complex together.</p>
<p>Two boys beg their parents for a television set, nagging them until all patience is lost. The parents order the boys to be quiet and the boys do exactly that--refusing to utter a word. The boys' silence ultimately puts the whole neighborhood into turmoil.</p>
<p>Two boys begin a silence strike to press their parents into buying them a television set.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Good Morning" (Japanese, 1959): Directed by Ozu. As in all of his films, Tokyo is the stage, and he populates them with his usual team of actors. Think of the professional stability of Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen, or John Waters, but Japanese. Ozu concentrates on small moments made meaningful. Unlike the quiet, black and white drama "Tokyo Story", this later film (in color) is a gentle comedy about how people build the character of each and every day with the smallest of gestures  which is this case is brought to our attention by two small brothers who decide to go "on strike" insisting that their Father get a television for the household. It's a loving, funny, and forgiving look at how silly we all can be.</p>
