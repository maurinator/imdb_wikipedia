<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bhola (Sunil Dutt) is a simple minded young man who has taken a vow to act according to the book of shashtras, which dictate that a man must marry when he is of the right age. He meets with lovely Bindu (Saira Banu) and falls head in love with her. Coincidentally, Bindu moves in next to his house. Bhola is thrilled, but soon despairs when he learns that Bindu has given her heart to Master Pillai (Mehmood). Bhola's friends Vidyapathi (Kishore Kumar), Banarasi (Mukri), and others belonging to an acting troupe, assist in hoodwinking Bindu to get attracted to Bhola, and thereby getting his love life back, but there are unexpected twists and turns, and Bhola's lies are exposed, making Bindu return to her plans to marry Master Pillai. Songs include: "Me chali me chali dekho pyar ki gali mujhe rokhe na koi..."; "Bhai bathur ab jaienge kitni door, najook najook meri jawani chalne se majboor..."; "Ik chatur naar karke singhar mere man ke duar ye goosath jaat..."; "Sarm ahti hai magar aaj yeh kahena hoga ab hamey aap ke kadmon main rahena hoga..."; "Kahena hai kahena hai akhir aaj ye tumse pehli baar, tum hi to lai ho jeevan me mere pyar pyar pyar....".</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Padosan, who hasn't heard of it? Well if you are one of those unfortunate souls who hasn't, I feel terribly saddened for your state. You my friend, need a good lesson in Indian Cinema. I suggest you start by watching this film.Padosan, which means 'Neighbor' is the story of Bhola (Sunil Dutt) who li ke his name is a very naive and innocent soul who happens to see Bindu(Saira Banu) and falls in love with her. He later finds out that she is his neighbor. We find out that Bindu is enamored with music and into the picture comes her music teacher, Masterji (Mehmood) who aside from being a bumbling fool who speaks in Tamil accented Hindi, is also in love with Bindu. So back to our Bhola bala hero. He tries to woo her but to no avail until he enlists the help of his friend and mentor Guru (Kishore Kumar) who owns an acting troupe of which Bhola is a part of.After much investigation, Guru and his friends discover that Bindu's soft spot is music. But unfortunately our Bhola is quite the novice when it comes to singing, sounding more like a braying donkey than a singing suitor. And so begins one of the whackiest cons in cinema. Guru sings, and Bhola lip-syncs. Guru's (Kishore Kumar's) voice being what it is, bewitches Bindu and she starts falling for Bhola. This development thwarts Masterji's master plan of marrying Bindu. So now begins a jugal-bandi between Masterji and Guru (ahem Bhola) for Bindu's affections.With such a whacky plot, there are laughs aplenty. Add master comedians Mehmood and Kishore Kumar and a funny looking Sunil Dutt, you have the perfect recipe for a hilariously whacky romantic comedy. Saira Banu, oozing of charm is quite good as the spoilt Bindu. Music is also excellent. R.D. Burman masterfully comes up with songs fit for the situations. The most famous of all being "Mere samnewali khidki mein" which is hummed even today. "Meri chatur naar" is extremely fun to watch and kishore kumar's vocals are excellent. All this making Padosan an exquisite classic that MUST NOT BE MISSED!!</p>
