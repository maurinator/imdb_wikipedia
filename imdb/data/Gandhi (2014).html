<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Charming, sweet, comfortably edgy, and downright hilarious. The filmmakers (disclaimer: I know them from other projects) basically drive through SF (there's a really cool turning angle) while talking about different outfits to don for Halloween, with each idea worse / better than the other. Also, watching this gave me some Halloween ideas. Thanks, Reena and Shane! I'm either winning best dressed or getting egged. October 31st will decide.The cinematography is reminiscent from the earlier days of Wes Craven horror films. Actually that's a lie. This is one of those films where superior lensing won't make it better. But can make it feel overproduced, which is a road I'm glad they didn't take.Acting comes of natural and easy to swallow. The reactions of the side characters could have been more developed, but it's really fine the way it is. CAAM fest liked it plenty. This short is more on the lines of a Jimmy Fallow insert / digital short than a indie short film. As they say, "this is scalable comedy'</p>
