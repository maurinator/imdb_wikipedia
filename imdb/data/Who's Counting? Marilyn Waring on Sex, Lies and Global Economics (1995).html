<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an entertaining introduction to the work of Marilyn Waring, who was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 1975 at age 22, and has been a national and international economic gadfly ever since. The story begins with Waring as a political innocent, when she used "the art of the dumb question" to discover, then demonstrate, that the principles of economics have little to do with the real world costs and benefits of production and consumption. If you've ever wondered why things don't seem better when the GDP is up, you'll now understand. The film also depicts her efforts to put the spotlight on the unpaid labor of women around the world, the obscenity of military spending, and the importance of environmental preservation.Waring has a direct manner of thinking and speaking, and a wonderful sense of humor, making Who's Counting an entertaining primer for anyone who suffers from what she refers to as economic anxiety.</p>
