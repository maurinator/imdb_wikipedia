<h1>No Highway in the Sky (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Theodore Honey is an aeronautical engineer being sent to Labrador from London to examine the wreckage of a new passenger plane designed by his company. His theory is that the planes are susceptible to metal fatigue after a specific amount of time in the air. The absent minded Honey boards the Reindeer class plane and only realizes that this plane is due to fail in the next few hours after the plane is airborne. He decides to warn the crew and creates an incident regardless of whether he is right or wrong.</p>
<p>Theodore Honey is an aeronautical engineer who is conducting stress tests on the tail assembly for a relatively new airplane, the Reindeer, manufactured by his employer. He is convinced that at approximately 1440 hours of use, vibration will have caused sufficient metal fatigue for the tail to just fall off. A Reindeer recently crashed in Labrador and he is sent there to see if the tail can be found and examined. The flight is on a Reindeer and when he learns that the plane is fast approaching it's limit, he causes quite a commotion. He's returned to England and will now likely be fired. He does have some supporters however including stewardess Marjorie Corder and actress Monica Teasdale but his testing has not yet provided any definite proof there is a design flaw in the aircraft.</p>
<p>An aeronautical engineer predicts that a new model of plane will fail catastrophically and in a novel manner after a specific number flying hours.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here is a film about people --real people, of conviction, and of character. The central problem, an aeronautical engineering equation, simply serves as avehicle around which unforgettable characters revolve. James Stewart issimply wonderful as Mr. Honey, and Marlene Dietrich shines, and grows, as"star" Monica Teasdale. An enduring film masterpiece for thoughtful adults.The supporting actors are first rate: the daughter was surprising believable, the wonderful Glynis Johns in her usual dream performance. I rate it 9 out of 10, as these films will not happen soon again. Thoughtful dramas about flight and aeronautics abounded in the late 40's and 50's -- I recommend the British entry "The Night my Number Came Up" -- and should be studied and regarded byserious film devotees.</p>
