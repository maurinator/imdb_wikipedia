<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a truly interesting horror flick that was so popular that sequels have been coming out ever since, none of course matching this one: the original.The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off once "Chucky" comes to life. It almost takes half the movie for that to happen. It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention. The only change I would have made was to the end the movie five minutes earlier, but they tacked on something that wasn't needed.The doll's owner "Andy," (Alex Vincent) is a cute little kid and Alex does a decent job of acting while Catherine Hicks is fine as his mom. A familiar face in the '80s, Chris Sarandon, adds his talents as a detective.Instead of all the stupid sequels, I would have preferred to see a remake done, now that special-effects have made such great advances. For instance, at least with the VHS I have, Chuckie's lips aren't even in sync with the dialog! He walks a little too wooden-like but the other special-effects were just fine. Nothing is to be taken seriously, anyway. It's just a silly voodoo-type story (you should hear the explanation of who "Chuckie" is) and just played for a scary horror film. On that level, it works because it IS scary.</p>
