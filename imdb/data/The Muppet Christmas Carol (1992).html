<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fine film that will put all you Christmas lovers into a festive,Christmassy mood and even those who aren't so optimistic about the festive season,it will definately lighten your hearts and cheer you up!The traditonal story of Ebenezer Scrooge-who despises Christmas above everything else is closing up for Christmas Eve and goes off home 'humbugging' everyone who wishes him a 'Merry Christmas'.When he's sitting in his home,he's visited by his old fellow workers-Jacob and Robert Marley and they bring him the news that he will be visited by three ghosts that very night when the clock strikes one.Terrified,Ebenezer goes to bed and is visited by the three ghosts-the ghost of Christmas Past who shows him previous experieneces of Christmas in his own past,The ghost of Christmas Present who shows Ebenezer the present Christmas and finally the ghost of Christmas yet to come who shows Ebenezer his future-which isn't very good.Ebenezer is terrified and vows to change his evil,wicked ways and to rejoice Christmas. And so he does and makes everyone else around him happy.A fine film portrayed brilliantly by Michael Caine and the muppets-Kermit the frog,Miss.Piggy and The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens narrating the film himself.The best out of them all!</p>
