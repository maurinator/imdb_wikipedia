<h1>Jason's Lyric (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of a young man, Jason (Allen Payne) who must confront his trauma-induced insecurity about love, as well as a sense of owed responsibility to his mother and troubled brother Joshua (Bokeem Woodbine). Jason, an assistant manager and sales clerk at an electronics store, falls in love with Lyric (Jada Pinkett Smith) and finds happiness, but his family history and mentally ill war veteran father, Maddog (Forest Whitaker) plague his life's plans before he can leave it all for a better life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film pretty much came out at a time when more and more films featuring blacks in positive images were coming out. This film came out around the same time as another film that Jada Pinkett was in, The Inkwell. However, this film tries to be three films at once. First its a story about the tragic events in the brother's past. The second story is almost an urban version of "Romeo and Juliet". The third plot revolves around how Jason's brother constantly gets into trouble leading to his tragic end. The love story would have been enough for me because it shows that African Americans can have very loving relationships and can be romantic. Unfortunately, in the end it turns into a typical bloody shootout, but it does have a twist ending and that helped to save it.</p>
