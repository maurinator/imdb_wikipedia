<h1>The Transformers: The Movie (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This theatrical movie based on the television series (which was also based on a popular multiform robot toyline) did not go over very well at the box office. The movie takes place in 2005, twenty years after the television series, and chronicles the efforts of the heroic Autobots to defend their homeworld Cybertron from the evil Decepticons. Both factions are seething with anger, and that hatred has blinded them to a hideous menace headed their way. That menace is the colossal planet named Unicron, who has been ready to consume anything that stands in its way. The only thing that can stop Unicron is the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, which is possessed by the Autobots and which the Decepticons, through Unicron's orders, plan to take away from them.</p>
<p>It is the year 2005. The battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons has escalated through their homeworld Cybertron, which the Decepticons have conquered. Without Optimus Prime after a conflict on Earth takes his life, the Autobots must face a destiny which they know nothing about. Megatron and a group of forsaken Decepticons have been reformed by the ultimate transformer, a planet consuming demon known as Unicron into even deadlier warriors. Galvatron, Scourge and Cyclonus must destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Unicron's glory or suffer the horrific destruction of Cybertron. However, Optimus Prime has decreed that an Autobot will rise from his rank and use the power of the Matrix to light the darkest hour of the Autobots. With Hot Rod facing responsibility for Prime's death, he feels he may be able to use the power of the Matrix to turn the tide of the Cybertronian Wars and stop Unicron. Until all are one, the future of the Autobots and the Decepticons is uncertain.</p>
<p>The Autobots must stop a colossal planet consuming robot who goes after the Autobot Matrix of Leadership. At the same time, they must defend themselves against an all-out attack from the Decepticons.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all, anyone who has left a negative comment on this movie has  something wrong with them, seriously.I have no idea when I first saw this movie but I was about 6-ish. I'm  now 22 and this is still a bloody awesome film. I have always been a  big Transformers fan and I know I might seem a bit bias, but I own the  movie on DVD and have shown it to a number of transformer illiterates,  male and female, young and old and still the only people I know who  have ever got a bit sick of it are my parents, as they have seen it  about as many times as myself.Everything about this movie is excellent, from the new characters, to  the fact that the autobots seem to suck at shooting anything ( as  opposed to the usual 'bad guys can't shoot for doit'.) even down to  what would be, if not for the movie it's in, one of the crappiest songs  ever 'the touch', by the Loins I think. THE Battle, Primes death, the  creation of Galvatron, the Junkbots, Sharkticons, Unicron, IT IS ALL  GOLD!!!!Anyone who liked 80's cartoons should love this movie, and so should  all your Kids, if not, I think it's time to go and get checked out by  your G.P.</p>
