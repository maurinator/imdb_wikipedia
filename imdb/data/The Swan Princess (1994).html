<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have the VHS for this which is 16 years old and I always watch it whenever there is nothing on TV.The film is about a beautiful princess named Odette who falls in love with a handsome prince named Derek whom she met as a kid and the two of them don't get along at first but as they are brought together every summer they fall in love with each other.Of course when Odette gets older an evil warlock wants her from himself and when she refuses to marry him as he is taking over her kingdom every time the moon goes she is magically transformed into a swan and when the moon comes back the next day she is turned back into a human again.Although its kinda silly in a way and a bit old-fashioned but I like this film for a very long time as it was fun,cute,romantic and sweet. The songs were so sweet like For longer than forever was such a romantic ballad and that other song No more Mr nice guy which had me smiling for days. The characters were colorful,the plot was nice and cheerful,the ending was nice.If you like transformation movies like Beauty & the Beast,Brother Bear,The Little Mermaid then check it out.8/10</p>
