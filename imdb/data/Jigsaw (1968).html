<h1>Jigsaw (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After inadvertently ingesting some sugar laced with LSD, a man wakes up with amnesia and in the middle of a murder plot.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A remake of 1965's "Mirage" updated for the late 60s by making LSD more important to the plot than amnesia (Gregory Peck's "problem" in the earlier film).  "Jigsaw" was actually produced by Universal as a TV movie, but like their earlier remake of "The Killers," it was released theatrically instead (but only briefly--in Cleveland, Ohio, it was brought in as a supporting feature for United Artists's "Hang 'Em High" at the Hippodrome theater when the latter film was in its final weeks).  Like "The Killers," it turned up on NBC shortly thereafter.  If it isn't as good as "Mirage," it isn't bad at all, although like a lot of Universal product at the time, its attempts to recreate contemporary youth culture looks very dated (I refer you to the discoteque sequence in the same year's "Coogan's Bluff").  Bradford Dillman is good in the role originally played by Peck, and Harry Guardino is better in Walter Matthau's private eye role.  Michael J. Pollard, still very prominent in the public eye at the time thanks to the endless re-issues of "Bonnie and Clyde," also turns up, and his presence was a key selling point in the advertising campaign.</p>
