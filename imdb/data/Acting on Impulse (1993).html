<h1>Acting on Impulse (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The aggressive actress Susan, star of many erotic thrillers, feels stalked by her fans and has a fight with her producer. During a one week long pause in the shooting of a movie, she retires into an hotel, unknowing that her producer is lying dead in her trailer. While the police searches her, she meets the married sales representative Paul on a congress and pulls him into an affair. However the stalkings begin again, more frightening than ever.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The plot is scatter shot, part murder mystery, part romance, and mostly goofy shenanigans. This uneasy mix makes "Acting on Impulse" so uneven that if it weren't for some darkly humorous dialog, a great looking black 1954 Corvette, and a few decent cameo appearances, the movie would be totally forgettable. Paul Bartel plays a movie director, which is really typecasting, since he was a director. Isaac Hayes is in and out of the picture from time to time as a detective, and Mary Woronov is a plain jane hotel desk clerk. Linda Fiorentino plays a second tier actress who is wanted for murdering a producer, and she eventually hooks up with C. Thomas Howell, and Nancy Allen at a pharmaceutical convention. The film has a very claustrophobic feel, as most of the story takes place in a hotel. It is definitely watchable, but the mish-mash script is constantly dragging it down, and oh yes there is a surprise ending. - MERK</p>
