<h1>Blue Collar (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three workers, Zeke (Richard Pryor), Jerry (Harvey Keitel) and Smokey (Yaphet Kotto), are working at a car plant and drinking their beers together. One night when they steal away from their wives to have some fun they get the idea to rob the local union's bureau safe. First they think it is a flop, because they get only 600 dollars out of it, but then Zeke realizes that they also have gotten some 'hot' material. They decide to blackmail their union. The best reason for that is the union itself. All three are provoked by the fact that the union claims to have lost 10,000 dollars by their robbery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great film.  I knew little about it going in, other than it was supposed to be a very well done, searing drama (this according to several film books, including Leonard Maltin's yearly tomes).  I was not disappointed.  Paul Schrader - writer of "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull," and writer/director of "Affliction" - delivers yet another gritty, working-class drama.  But the film is not without liberal doses of humor, provided chiefly by Richard Pryor in what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  C'mon, people!  How can you go wrong with Pryor, Harvey Keitel, and Yaphet Kotto (answer: you can't).  The films hooks you right from the great opening credit sequence and doesn't let go 'til the final freeze-frame.  I won't give the twists and turns of the plot away, but the film centers on three desperate Detroit auto workers and their corrupt union.  It's very disappointing this film is so overlooked today (it also flopped when released)... the level of acting and direction (this was Schrader's directorial debut) is astonishing.  See this movie!</p>
