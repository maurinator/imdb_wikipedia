<h1>Girls at Sea (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When HMS Scotia pays a visit to the French Riviera, the officers, to celebrate the engagement of Marine Captain Randall to a charming American girl, Jill Eaton, throw a big party,</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a lame British comedy, based apparently on a play, about a stiff admiral (Michael Hordern) with a jealous wife, who spends the night on board a ship as it cruises from Cannes to Genoa for a NATO conference, and becomes slowly aware that 3 nubile young women are on board, strictly against regulations. Lionel Jeffries has a cameo as an American tourist who asks naive questions about the ship's gyro compass. Daniel Massey, younger than I've ever seen him, played a ship's officer embarrassed by the goings on. Ronald Shiner appeared as a sailor who has jilted a French flower seller, who pursues him on board and gets accidentally locked in overnight.</p>
