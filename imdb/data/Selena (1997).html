<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not expecting to enjoy this movie, I was very pleasantly surprised.  Jennifer Lopez, Edward Olmos and the rest of the ensemble cast do a marvelous job in bringing the close-knit Quintanilla family to life.  The screenwriters and director skillfully lead the viewer from the father's failed attempts at rock 'n roll in the early 60s through Selena's childhood and her eventual rocket to the top of the Tejano music charts as a young woman.  Thankfully her murder is not addressed as a major plot item, its almost irrelevant.  And the concert scenes are fantastic.  Its Selena's voice and Lopez does an incredible job. Definitely worth a rental regardless of your musical tastes.</p>
