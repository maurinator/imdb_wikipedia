<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hit action comedy from celebrated writer Anders Thomas Jensen and director (and former stuntman) Lasse Spang Olsen. Put-upon Arvid is left by his girlfriend, and when he manages to foil a bank robbery with a squash racket, his life goes from bad to worse, getting involved with hardened criminal brother Harald (the excellent Kim Bodnia, tough and hilariously deadpan). Perhaps the highest body count of a Danish movie ever (Arvid accidentally wastes entire rockband Red Warszawa with a machine gun), film suffers from occasional amateurish stunts, but is peppered with Jensen´s terrific dialogue, and a what-me-worry approach that is very rare among Danish filmmakers. Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Tomas Villum Jensen make a great comedic duo as the reluctant body disposers, who just want to be cooks. Framed by a strange supernatural story that is so politically incorrect that you can´t help but laugh out loud.  *** (of ****)</p>
