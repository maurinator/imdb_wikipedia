<h1>Any Which Way You Can (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Philo takes part in a bare knuckle fight - as he does - to make some more money than he can earn from his car repair business. He decides to retire from fighting, but when the Mafia come along and arrange another fight, he is pushed into it. A motorcycle gang and an orangutan called Clyde all add to the 'fun'.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is one my guilty pleasures. I enjoy it a lot, but I know deep down that I shouldn't. I guess the reason I like it is because it has a unique gallery of characters. You've got bare knuckle fighters, a bald biker gang, underworld crime figures, a befuddled couple on their second honeymoon, corrupt state troopers and not one, not two, but three perverted motel managers. On top of all them, the best character in the movie is an orangutan named Clyde! I also like the exciting fight scenes, particularly the climatic fight, well staged in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It is the rare sequel that is far superior to the original. For many, that is not saying much but it is enough for me.</p>
