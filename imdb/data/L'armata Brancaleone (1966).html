<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Thanks to the french-speaking TV networks of my country (Canada), I litterally grew up with commedia all'italiana - Italy's crazy explosion of satirical comedies (1955-1980). Soon the "quartet of monsters" - Gassman, Manfredi, Sordi, Tognazzi - became my favourite comic stars. But when it comes to L'Armata Brancaleone, it is only two years ago that I finally found this movie, after a decade and a half of frentic research. The old Italian guy who sold me the (used) videocassette for 50 $ thinks he outsmarted me. No he did not! Even for a 1000 $, it would still be a bargain! For L'Armata Brancaleone is no less than a miracle of comic invention. The visceral power of this farce defies any superlatives I could find. Vittorio Gassman's performance as Brancaleone can only be compared to the greatest comics of the century. For their work on this film, scripters Age & Scarpelli, director Mario Monicelli and the whole team down to the most humble go-fer would deserve an enormous trophy.</p>
