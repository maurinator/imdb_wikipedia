<h1>Morte di un matematico napoletano (1992)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film has an ambitious agenda.  I don't know what it is.  But you can feel it.There are luscious sceneries sometimes because of it bareness alone.  The way the characters interact have a certain quality which seems both surreal and too real.It is a good little film that should not be taken lightly.</p>
