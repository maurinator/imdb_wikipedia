<h1>Let's Get Harry (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When Harry Burck (Harmon), an American engineer on loan to Colombia, is taken hostage and held for ransom, his brother Corey (Schoeffling) and friend Jack (Busey) are among a group of men, lead by Shrike (Duvall), who go deep into the jungles of Colombia to rescue Harry and an American ambassador.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's no wonder this ultra-right wing fantasy never made it to theaters: besides stretching credibility to the outer limits of logic and coherence, it tacitly criticizes the Reagan administration as wimps for not effectively dealing with the threat of terrorism (presumably by nuking them out of their Third World foxholes). Mark Harmon plays an American engineer kidnapped in Bolivia by some very well dressed freedom fighters, prompting his beer-drinking buddies back in Aurora Illinois, to stage a daring paramilitary rescue in the jungles of South America (which look suspiciously not unlike Southern California). Robert Duvall lends the film a token measure of respectability in his role as a hard-boiled soldier of fortune whose blood runs red, white and blue, but Gary Busey steals the show playing a crack shot used car salesman with a streak of sadism. Sam Fuller had a hand in the story, which may explain some of the idiot masculinity, and the director's credit is actually a telltale industry pseudonym used when nobody has the guts to claim responsibility. Tune in the next time it shows up on late-night TV and find out why.</p>
