<h1>Lies My Father Told Me (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's the 1920's. The Hermans - Harry Herman, his wife Annie Herman née Elias, their adolescent son David Herman, and Annie's father - are a Jewish family living in a small flat in the working class Jewish neighborhood of Montréal. David loves his "Zaida" (grandfather) with who he spends most Sundays driving around in their horse drawn wagon collecting junk - namely "rags, clothes, bottles" - to earn money. David also loves hearing his Zaida's stories about their Jewish culture, although most of those stories are made up and not based based on religious Jewish beliefs. Those stories are only one bone of contention between religious Zaida and secular Harry, as modern thinking Harry feels the stories are old fashioned hogwash and provide David with no grounding in what is real in life. Another issue of contention is money, as Harry is always dreaming of get rich schemes - the latest being to manufacture permanently creased and thus iron-less trousers - for which Zaida will not provide unconditional funding. And a third issue is Zaida's aging horse Ferdeleh, which Harry believes would be better put to sleep. Usually, David, who is at the stage in his life where he takes most things literally, sides with his Zaida, and considers his father a liar. Caught in the middle is Annie. How to handle David becomes a larger issue when two of the most natural of events occur within their family.</p>
<p>A Jewish boy grows up in 1920s Montreal with a grandfather who tells stories and a father who won't work.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>David (author Ted Allan) is a boy growing up in the Jewish ghetto of Montreal in the 1920s.  He idolizes his rag picker grandfather and tries to make sense of his parents' world.  This  is a charming and heartwarming look at the love and special bond between a child and a grandparent.  The plot is made of vignettes but is ultimately a very cohesive look at microcosmic society.   Yossi Yadin as the Grandfather Zaida gives a superb performance. The parade of eccentric characters never fails to keep one's interest. Author Ted Allan, who earned a Oscar nom for this screenplay, plays the supporting role of Mr. Baumgarten.  Definitely worth a look - a good family film.</p>
