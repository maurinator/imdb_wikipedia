<h1>The Bedford Incident (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Richard Widmark plays a hardened cold-warrior and captain of the American destroyer USS Bedford. Sidney Poitier is a reporter given permission to interview the captain during a routine patrol. Poitier gets more than he bargained for when the Bedford discovers a Soviet sub in the depths and the captain begins a relentless pursuit, pushing his crew to the breaking point. This one's grim tension to the end.</p>
<p>Tension is high aboard the destroyer USS Bedford as it tracks a Soviet submarine in the North Atlantic. Capt. Eric Finlander runs a taut, disciplined ship and his stern approach isn't appreciated or understood by the lone civilian on board, journalist Ben Munceford. The sub they are tracking can only stay under for a maximum of 24 hours and Finlander has every intention of being right there when it has to surface. With the ship on what is essentially a constant war footing, the officers and men are always on edge. Mistakes are inevitable.</p>
<p>An American news writer assigned to interview the captain of the destroyer USS Bedford bears witness to a stunning game of cat and mouse in the frigid waters of the northern Atlantic. A Soviet submarine has been tailing the Bedford and the captain of the Bedford turns tail to confront the Soviet sub. As the cat-and-mouse pursuit continues, the Bedford's captain becomes more obsessed with the Soviet sub, until an accident involving one of his increasingly shaken crewmen leads to a confrontation no one wants, and that no one can win.</p>
<p>An American destroyer captain is determined to confront a Soviet submarine caught violating territorial waters. Perhaps too determined.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film contains one (or more) of the great character studies of its period--and indeed, is one of the few films that can sustain itself principally on character interaction, irrespective of plot (and the plot itself builds steady tension, a la Hunt for Red October). The pacing is brilliant, the acting is top-shelf, the claustrophobic shipboard mood is electrifying, the escalating, multi-tiered sense of confrontation between the key characters is riveting, and the payoff--though admittedly predictable, by the time you get there--is effective and unnerving nevertheless, especially if one is able to toggle back to the Cold War mentality that birthed this film.I too was a bit put off by the studied and self-conscious Widmark reactions at two or three points in the film--the tactic becomes a well to which Widmark/Lumet go back at least twice too often (the last time, I found myself almost wanting to scream, "We GET it!"). But that's a very small price to pay for the overall cinematic genius (not too strong a word) of this movie. The script alone--in particular the climactic riposte Portman delivers unto the increasingly pathological Widmark towards the end of the film--is a masterwork rivaled by few other films of the era (or any era, for that matter). If you've seen the film, you know the line to which I'm referring. If you haven't seen the film, do yourself a favor and rectify that shortcoming.</p>
