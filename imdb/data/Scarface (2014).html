<h1>Scarface (2014)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Robbie goes to Hollywood in search of his real father: Al Pacino. Robbie has always known that Scarface is his father: during a promotional tour in the Netherlands, Robbie's mother had an affair with him. Now she is dying of cancer, Robbie wants to find his father to reunite him with his mother. With his best friend - and no-good manager - Raoul, he travels to Hollywood to search for Al Pacino - and fame. They encounter many people, from Scarface's boss Robert Loggia to Ron Jeremy, and even crash the Oscars - but will they find Al Pacino in time? Thirty years after Scarface, Son of Scarface is a hilarious independent mockumentary about the modern preoccupation with fame and the glorification of the gangster lifestyle.</p>
