<h2> Summaries </h2>

Meggie tries to forget Ralph by marrying dashing stockman Luke O'Neill, but she and Ralph are soon reunited, with tragic consequences for them both.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>My Mother talked me into watching this movie with her about 15 years ago. I loved it but didn't quite understand all the emotion behind it. I watched it again this past week and was amazed at how differently it spoke to me. We can learn so much about love, forgiving and humility from this story. I also loved how in the end Meggie and her mother finally come to understand one another and her mother is able to show her the love she has longing for. It's a great reminder to not put off showing love to those close to us, but to be like Meggie and give it whether it is given or not.If it's been a while see it again, because your perspective has changed and it will mean something different to you today.If you have never seen it before, I think it is well worth the time you'll invest in seeing it. But be sure to grab some tissues.</p>
