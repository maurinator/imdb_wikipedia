Paco is caught and sent to the same prison where he reworks his revenge plan, and Mick has no choice but to defend himself.</p>
<p>Chicago crime kid Mick O'Brien is sent to reform school after accidentally killing Paco Moreno's kid brother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sean Penn, Esai Morals, Ally Sheedy, and the other principles in this film deliver great, realistic, gritty performances.  Certainly one of the great performances of Penn's career.My only complaint is that the DVD release by ARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT & REPUBLIC PICTURES - Deletes 2 scenes from the original. (That may explain the bargain pricing).  The deleted scenes I noticed are: 1. The scene in which Ally Sheedy's character picks Esai's character out of a line-up. 2. A scene inside the Juvenile facility where the inmates are watching the Richard Widmark film "KISS OF DEATH", where he pushes the old, wheelchair-bound lady down the stairs, much to the delight of the inmates!</p>
