<h1>Basquiat (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Basquiat tells the story of the meteoric rise of youthful artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Starting out as a street artist, living in Thompkins Square Park in a cardboard box, Jean-Michel is "discovered" by Andy Warhol's art world and becomes a star. But success has a high price, and Basquiat pays with friendship, love, and eventually, his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I cannot believe that Basquiat isn't high in the top 250; it is easily the best movie I have ever seen.  No matter whether or not you like/liked Basquiat's art, this movie is amazing.  In fact, you'll probably enjoy the movie more if you don't like his art.  Basquiat was a crackhead who chose to live on the street.  None of his art demonstrated amazing artistic technique, yet with the help of some exorbitantly rich, twisted and influential people in the art world, he rose from the gutter and gained international stardom.  Whether he deserved his fame, wealth and glory is addressed throughout the film, but the movie is more about how his self-destructive tendencies managed to get the better of him and lead him to an early death.  The movie is very depressing, but also inspiring.  The acting is fantastic overall, although Dennis Hopper was awful as Bruno and I wish that Courtney Love were not cast as Big Pink.  The film itself is even a work of art.  Don't see it if you're only into mystery, horror, suspense, or action films, but if you like art or are at all intellectual, see it see it see it see it see it!</p>
