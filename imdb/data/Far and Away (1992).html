<p>Joseph Donnelly, a young Irish man facing property eviction after his father's death, decides to take revenge on Daniel Christie, his landlord. In an attempt to kill Christie, however, he is injured and sentenced to a duel with Christie's arrogant manager, Stephen Chase. Meanwhile, Shannon, Daniel's daughter, is growing dissatisfied with the traditional views of her parents' generation and longs to be modern. She makes her plans to leave for the U.S., and with her help, Joseph is able to escape. Upon arriving in Boston, they find jobs and begin saving money. Joseph becomes a local bare-hands boxer, while Shannon works in a chicken processing plant and then as a dancer at the social club.

Shannon's parents, still in Ireland, face a devastating loss and decide to come to America to be with her.

After many months, Joseph is confronted by his father in a dream, and is reminded of his desire to own his own land. Joseph decides to join the wagon trains and arrives in Oklahoma Territory just in time for the big land race, upon which his fate will lie.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is beautiful.  It's wonderful to see Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in a good film.  The movie has a pretty good historical point of view so the plot is kind of self telling.  The scenery in this is great.  And, it's fun to see Tom fight, and Nicole wash clothes.  Oh, for the fight scenes nothing gory.  For parents:  this movie shouldn't be shown to really little kids. For teens it's cute.  And, adults well take a crack at it.  Oh by the way, a little bit of nudity, but nothing bad.  Just trust me.  It's a very well done and beautiful film.  9/10 stars.</p>
