<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr That is the main phrase of what Tarzan uses when trouble is about to  come. I did enjoy this movie, every minute of it, it was made in 1999,  i think it was is the first ever tarzan movie to be made into a catoon  and to be made by Disney. I you like this movie then i am pretty sure  you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of  Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions  he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant.  I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see  Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there  will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.</p>
