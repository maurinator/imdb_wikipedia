<p>When London airport is fogged in, several travelers on the postponed flight to New York find themselves affected in one way or another. Frances Andros is running away from her husband Paul, a rich industrialist. She is unhappy in her marriage and feels that her husband no longer appreciates her. She is accompanied by her new love, Marc Champselle, a suave gigolo who genuinely loves her as well. She's left a note for her husband at home and the delay allows him to get wind of her plans and return to the airport to confront her. For businessman Les Mangrum, he's going to New York to stave off the take over of his company. It's essential that he attend the Board meeting later that day but a cheque he's written may be his downfall. His secretary, Miss Mead, finds a solution when she comes across Paul Andros in the hotel lobby. For movie producer Max Buda, getting out of England has to do with money - if he isn't out of the country by midnight, he will owe the British taxman a hefty sum. For the Duchess of Brighton, traveling to the USA is all about earning money to save her manor house and property. She's never flown before but the chance meeting with Max Buda provides her with a solution to her problems.</p>
<p>Fog delays a group of travelers headed for New York. They wait at the V.I.P. lounge of London Airport, each at a moment of crisis in his or her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>but a fascinating melodrama also. This was the first movie Liz Taylor and Richard Burton made as a married couple.The story is by Terence Rattigan who apparently based it on a scene he observed in the VIP lounge of London Airport when Vivien Leigh made plans to run away with Peter Finch and was stopped by her husband, Laurence Olivier.It is well filmed, way ahead of its time in certain segments where other minor characters are playing in the background of the scene, a continuum not employed in movies until the nineties (this was filmed in the early 60s).Some of the script is a hoot, the fact that Liz and her lover are running away without ever having "made love". Richard and Liz both overact dramatically. But the cast make it well worth watching.Maggie Smith is particularly vulnerable as a secretary, she is yet to find the acerbic edge that laces her subsequent movies. Margaret Rutherford is particularly good as a Duchess who has to go earn a living in America to save her stately home. More scenes with her would have been a treat.7 out of 10, totally watchable and almost sinful in the enjoyment of same, it is just so deliciously shallow.</p>
