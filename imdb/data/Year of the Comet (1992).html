<h1>Year of the Comet (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An extremely rare bottle of wine (bottled during the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811) is discovered. Margaret Harwood is sent to retrieve it so it can be sold at auction. Oliver Plexico is assigned as her travel guide/bodyguard for the trip. However, other people desperately want the bottle and will stop at nothing to get it. A simple little trip becomes an international chase.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I found this to be a small film full of heart, a charming, winsome example of how powerful the story of two people can be. Full of humor, breathtaking scenery, and quirky characters, it's an enjoyable film to see again and again.Tim Daly turned in an engaging performance as the mostly bemused Oliver Plexico. Penelope Ann Miller, later seen to devastating effect in The Shadow, turns in a light but powerful performance as the determined Margaret Harwood. Together, they battle enraged farmers, violent scientists, and each other before true love wins out--and the ending is as charming, quirky, and brow-raising as the rest of the film.Truly, a wonderfully intimate little film about the perils of the wine business--and falling in love.</p>
