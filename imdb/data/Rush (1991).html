<h1>Rush (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Raynor is an undercover narcotics cop. For his next assignment he chooses the more inexperienced but tough and good-looking Kristen. Their ultimate target is Gaines, a renowned but very elusive drug dealer. While doing their work they unexpectedly fall into a morass of drug-addiction and fall in love with each other. Despite subjecting themselves to the life of low-class, one-track junkies they do not get the evidence they want to convict Gaines, and instead are forced into using false evidence in court.</p>
<p>Two small-town Texas cops go undercover to catch a major drug dealer and are sucked into the drug culture, compromising their assignment.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>While no masterpiece, "Rush" is an offbeat, well made film set in the early '70's centering on the efforts of some Texas cops to bust supposed drug dealer Greg Allman -- at all costs.All of the actors perform well -- Jason Patric gives a particularly intense performance as the once idealistic  officer who has obviously stayed undercover too long.Great score by Eric Clapton. I really have no idea why this fairly unconventional film (gee, maybe that was the reason -- it wasn't a formulaic cop/buddy movie) did not receive more acclaim. 7/10.</p>
