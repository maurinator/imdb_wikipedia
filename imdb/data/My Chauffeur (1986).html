<h1>My Chauffeur (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A free-spirited young woman (Deborah Foreman) upsets the status quo at a stuffy Brentwood limousine service.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has many highlights -- the blue lady walking a dog scene, the tar pit scene, the hillbilly hospitality scene, the car thief scene and on and on including the entire Bone & Abdul (i.e. Penn & Teller) routine. There are no low points. Deb is in top form -- cute, coy and adorable. Aside from a couple of minor continuity flaws, the movie is perfect. And if your wondering where I got my name from, watch the movie. Yes, Deb, I wanna be your dog! :-)</p>
