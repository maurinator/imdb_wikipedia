<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As graduation day approaches, Joey has a tough time preparing her commencement speech, and Dawson helps her find some bittersweet inspiration. Pacey wonders if he's going to graduate at all and worries that his last final will be the toughest one. He walks out of it after his teacher makes a rude comment on him, costing him his diploma. Meanwhile, Andie McPhee returns to Capeside for the cap and gown ceremony, and is surprised to meet Jack's new boyfriend, Tobey. Pacey spends some quality time with Andie and decides he must get out of town to search for his feelings. After a friendly talk with Doug about his future, Pacey privately says his goodbyes to Doug, and then leaves town, vowing never to return. Also, Drue temporarily moves into Jen's house after being kicked out of his home by his mother after an argument. Drue then tells Jen that before they both graduate and go their separate ways to college, he convinces her to help him pull a hilarious senior prank for old times sake by setting off the school sprinkler system during the ceremony. But they get caught by Principal Peskin whom forces them to listen to his awful violin playing skills for three hours as their final detention of punishment.</p>
