<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A strong drama about the lives of the "mensús" (name given in Argentina to persons that received a monthly pay) who worked under terrible conditions in the mate plantations located in the Northeastern region of Argentina, and wanted modern work regulations . The drama is told from the point of view of a couple that also represents a new type of relationship, different from other couples in which women are abused. The film is based on the novel "El río oscuro" (The Dark River), by Alfredo Varela (who was in prison during production), a work that differs from those that stress the dichotomy rural setting-the city, and centers on the problems of its location, searching solutions within its community. Singer Hugo del Carril turned filmmaker and became a prestigious author, here following the Italian neo-realist aesthetics. A true classic of Argentinean cinema.</p>
