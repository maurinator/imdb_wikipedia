<h1>The Front (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the early 1950s Howard Prince, who works in a restaurant, helps out a black-listed writer friend by selling a TV station a script under his own name. The money is useful in paying off gambling debts, so he takes on three more such clients. Howard is politically pretty innocent, but involvement with Florence - who quits TV in disgust over things - and friendship with the show's ex-star - now himself blacklisted - make him start to think about what is really going on.</p>
<p>In the 50's, in New York City, the screenplay writer Alfred Miller meets his apolitical friend, the cashier of restaurant and smalltime bookmaker Howard Prince and tells him that he can not work anymore since he is blacklisted. Prince offers to sell his scripts to the producer of a TV station using his own name and Alfred offers a 10% commission to Prince. Prince uses the money to pay his debts and improve his life and soon he offers his name to two other blacklisted writers. Meanwhile he dates the TV screenplay editor Florence Barrett. When the veteran actor Hecky Brown is blacklisted and fired by the producer Phil Sussman, the idealistic Florence quits her job. But when Hecky Brown commits suicide, Prince takes a stand against the unjust system.</p>
<p>Woody Allen plays a man of no real talent or strong political convictions who is paid to be a front for a group of black listed writers during the McCarthy period in the United States (early 1950s). There are comedic elements in his attempts to pass off stories he hasn't read as his own, until he comes under the view of the UnAmerican Activities Subcommittee.</p>
<p>A cashier poses as a writer for blacklisted talents to submit their work through, but the injustice around him pushes him to take a stand.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Front tells the story of an average Joe Loser whose friend, a blacklisted television writer asks for his identity so he can continue working.  Thus begins not only an acceptable scam, but a personal odyssey for this man, played by Woody Allen.  He begins to be become a `front' for other blacklisted writers as well, presenting their material as his own.  His evolution is such that while he began to do this mainly for his own profit, he ends up taking a stand on behalf of the blacklisted artists he knows and along the way, finding his own relevance in life. While starring Woody Allen, the film was directed by Martin Ritt, a blacklisted artist himself.  Additionally, it featured a blacklisted writer and several blacklisted actors, including Zero Mostel.  There are definite comedic moments in the film, but they are generally limited to a line or the facial expression of a character, therefore I consider this to be a largely dramatic film.  (Albeit light drama).  Making a comedy about HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) and the Hollywood Blacklist is like offering a comedy about the Salem Witch Trails.  Both events involved the destruction of the lives of the victims due to the paranoia and hysteria of their contemporary societies and neither subject is comic fodder.Of the films centering on HUAC that I have seen, The Front is by far the most representative and most meaningful I have seen to date.  The Front is a very important chronicle of a dark period in 20th century history and deserves the many accolades it has received.--Shelly</p>
