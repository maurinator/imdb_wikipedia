<h1>Série noire (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Franck Poupart is a slightly neurotic door-to-door salesman in a sinister part of Paris' suburbs. He meets Mona, a teenager, who's been made a prostitute by her own aunt. Franck would like to change his life and also save Mona from her aunt. Murder is the only solution he finds to achieve his goal... A very gloomy movie, exuding dispair and uneasiness, with pathetic characters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Serie noire is an excellent french movie, especially because of the acting of Patrick Dewaere, unfortunately dead now. The atmosphere is noire and tough and it is impossible not to be touched by the sensibility of this personnage play by Patrick dewaere. This is one of my favourite films of the seventies.</p>
