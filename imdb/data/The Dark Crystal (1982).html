<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'm so sick and tired of people bad-mouthing this movie.This is the best of one of Jim Henson's creations (besides Jim Henson's Hour The Storyteller and Mythology)!It isn't so preachy or cheesy like a lot of the works before or after Henson's demise!This would be a good movie for little kids.You can really tell the good from the bad in this movie.The Skeksis are really evil and frightening villains,unlike a lot of villains in most family-fantasy films,where they are often more moronic than vile.The characters have personalities,not so talkative and there's no human to be seen!All 100% animatronics,no actors in the suits!!!Now how amazing is that?</p>
