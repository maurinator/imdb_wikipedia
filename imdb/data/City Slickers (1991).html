<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is for anyone who needs relief from a crisis, middle-aged or otherwise.Three buddies head down the trails to relieve their midlife crises. They wind up sharing the adventures of a lifetime. I have enjoyed this movie each and every time I have seen it. The comedy is pleasant, and you will not exhale during the river rescue scene. *** out of ****</p>
