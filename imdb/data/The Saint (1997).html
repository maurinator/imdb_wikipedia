<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Back in the sixties Roger Moore don the persona of Simon Templar, known to his fans as The Saint. From the small tube to the Silver Screen, our hero has arisen to a modern audience. With the superb talents of Val Kilmer, the saint is out to accomplish two goals. First he attempts to secure his life-long ambition of amassing $1 billion dollars, and second to perform three miracles. In the process, he encounters both friends and life threatening villains. In this episode, the Saint attempts to save the crumbling Soviet Empire' energy supply, by revamping the scientific and long sought-after formula of Cold Fusion. In this story, he helps brainy, Dr. Lev Botvin, (Henry Goodman) perfect the celebrated formula of Physist Emma Russell, (Elisabeth Shue). The re-energized formula will replenish Russia's dwindling energy and save the Premiere of Russia from the anti-government villains played adroitly by (Rade Serbedzija), Ivan Tretiak, (Valeri Nikolayev) and Vereshagin (Michael Byrne), the archenemies of Templar. Alun Armstrong is believable as Inspector Teal. The film is fast paced and action oriented with plenty of drama, guns, explosions and international intrigue. Kilmer is fantastic and I believe this will become a classic among all the great films of his career. ****</p>
