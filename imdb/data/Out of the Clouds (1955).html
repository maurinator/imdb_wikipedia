<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>At London Airport, a variety of staff and passengers pass each other, their various stories are told here Â– some intertwined some separate.  Two passengers passing through meet briefly and develop a bond that seems due to be broken, an ex-pilot tries to pass his medical and get his wings back while another has to make a decision when faced with temptation.Modern audiences will be very familiar with ensemble films that have several characters whose stories overlap around one theme (in this case the airport).  However it doesn't really manage to pull this off to any great degree and it struggles to really paint an overall picture that engages.  The main part of the plot is the romantic meeting between two passengers; this doesn't work for several reasons.  Firstly, the plotting of it is strained and I never really bought into it.  Secondly the performances from the two actors involved are so poor that the material can't survive past that.The rest of the film has a few interesting strands with the pilots but again these don't really work out.  Part of the reason for this is the film just not having enough time to really develop the characters into real characters, rather than just stories.  The lack of character meant that I wasn't involved in the tale, rather just watching it.  It is a shame because I haven't seen such a film from this period, even though I could name several from the past 10 years, but it just doesn't work out.Overall it was a good try but the poor stories really draw a lot away from those that had potential.  The film struggles more because the stories with potential are not supported or developed enough to be involving.</p>
