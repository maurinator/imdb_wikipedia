<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Documentary about women working in factories during WWII and resultant loss of jobs after the war. Five women tell their stories. Fascinating clips of racist, sexist propaganda of the era.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is by far, the best documentary on the American home front during the Second World War.  It's also an excellent and extremely entertaining look at the spark that ignited the women's liberation movement nearly thirty years before it 'officially' planted its roots.  With thousands of men leaving the factories to fight in the war, and with the urgent, escalating need for America to arm itself, women were strongly encouraged to join the factory workforce.  They came from all over the country and discovered skills they never knew they had, both as laborers, and as independent women.  They were self-sufficient and strong (many of them endured double-shifts on a fairly regular basis), and they eventually discovered new freedoms by earning their own incomes and making their own choices on how to spend that money. Connie Field has created an extremely entertaining documentary that's choked full of interviews with women from all walks of life.  She intersperses lots of the newsreel footage and the popular songs that had been created in order to encourage and inspire the female workforce.  And she illustrates the myriad of ways in which women were discouraged from working after the war had ended, and how strong a role the media played in encouraging women to raise families and stay in the kitchen.  This film is rare glimpse of the Second World War from the female perspective, and a vital document of American history.</p>
