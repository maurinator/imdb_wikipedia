<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The plus side of having cable television with a movie channel or two is that you get the opportunity to see movies you might have otherwise missed somewhere along the way.  I'm talking about those charming little films that have a low budget but make up in heart what they're missing in window dressing.  Lovelife ain't one of those movies.  This is an overlong whine-a-thon where people give each other the shaft and can't figure out why they aren't in satisfying relationships.  Pretentious and pathetic all at once, this film tries to find honor in the fact that it isn't a mainstream film, and sacrifices everything that makes a film (mainstream and otherwise) entertaining in the process. Avoid this one.  It isn't even a good date movie.</p>
