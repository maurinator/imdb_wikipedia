<h1>Prisoner of Rio (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of the great train robber Ronald Biggs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Any film about Ronnie Biggs has potential, as did this film. Paul Freeman makes a good Biggs. Steven Berkoff is, as always worth watching.However, what really drags this film down is the amount of footage of parades and local events. At one point, I really had to ask myself if I was watching a film about Ronnie Biggs or a Tourist guide to Rio (which is what it often felt like). There is however, some excellent location work thrown in.Paul Freeman should play Biggs again. Perhaps a film about his return to England.I wish I could recommend this film. Unfortunately, I can't.</p>
