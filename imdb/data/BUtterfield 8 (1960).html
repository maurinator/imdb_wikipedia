<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If dated 60's camp with sexual innuendo and great outfits for the leading lady are your thing, then B8 will not disappoint. However speaking as a fan of such fare, this film leaves me a bit cold. Its camp moments and dialog are numerous enough, but B8 holds its best shocker for the end. The film, like Liz's character is a big tease. Taking small but well-placed stabs at sexual mores of the time period, but never really going further. Add Laurence Harvey's womanizing alcoholic, Dina Merrill as the waspy compliant wife, Eddie Fisher (La Taylor's current hubby at the time) in the non-essential role as Liz's pal, and Mildred Dunnock as Liz's annoying mother in denial, and you'll be hard pressed to find a likable character. Liz herself did not consider this her best performance. Shirley MacLaine called it "the Oscar I lost to the tracheotomy" referring to Taylor's near death from pneumonia complications in 1960. B8 (like other films that were based on camp sex novels of the 60's) would make a great remake if it remained set in the 60's but kept the shocks of the original book intact. If you love Liz, chances are you'll love B8. If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of O'Hara's landmark novel, this is not it.</p>
