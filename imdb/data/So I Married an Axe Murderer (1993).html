But Charlie begins suspecting something about Harriet that may not be so perfect.</p>
<p>A San Francisco poet who fears commitment has a girlfriend who he suspects may not be who she appears.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Mike Myers gives Waynes World a rest and delivers what I think is a better movie.... well better than Waynes World 2 anyway. It is a truly great movie with Mike playing a duel role, firstly as Charlie MacKenzie a young guy who is scared of commitment to women, then his dad Stuart MacKenzie a very funny Scotsman who could take the lead role in X Files with his ideas on Conspiracy. Nancy Travis stars as a butcher... Harriet, who ends up with Charlie..... A great movie that is very funny in the pre Austin Powers age, a 7 out of 10.</p>
