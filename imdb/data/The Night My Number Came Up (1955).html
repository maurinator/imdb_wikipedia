<h1>The Night My Number Came Up (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At a fashionable dinner party in Hong Kong a naval officer is coaxed into revealing details of a dream in which eight persons take off from Bangkok in a Dakota bound for Tokyo and crash in the Japanese mountains. Amongst those listening is Air Marshal Hardie who is due to fly to Tokyo the next day. Hardie initially dismisses the dream because he is scheduled to fly out in a Liberator, but as Hardie arrives at the airport he discovers that the Liberator has developed mechanical problems and has been replaced by a Dakota. When, just before the flight is due to depart, two soldiers board the plane making a complement of eight, Hardie fears that the Dream may be coming true and he is destined to die.</p>
<p>On a routine flight from Hong-Kong to Japan, a British military transport aircraft's fate may or may not depend on a prophetic nightmare.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw this great film not long after it was released in 1955. I remember sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the climax to come and make the prophecy come true. When the climax came I remember heaving a huge sigh of relief, so great was the tension created by the cast and directors. This is the type of film that 'sneaks up on you' because it was not released here as the main attraction (In the days when a black and white film was shown first and I thought it was far better than the film I had gone to see. I have seen it only once since then and it captured my attention just as much then. I wish a film company or TV channel would release it. I would dearly like to obtain a video copy of it as this seems to be the only way I'll ever get to see it again. Ron Sawers</p>
