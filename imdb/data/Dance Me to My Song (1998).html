<h1>Dance Me to My Song (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A woman trapped in a twisted body from her bouts with the debilitating cerebral palsy communicates with the world via her computer with a voice box. Her caretaker is a short-tempered woman who begrudges the woman the care she needs. Things change when Rose bumps into a young man who starts giving her attention. This leads her to start fantasizing about a real sexual relationship. However, the caretaker takes an interest in the man, as well, which leads to the dramatic conclusion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I commonly feel that too much attention is paid to the semantics of what I consider to be "convenient designations" for complex conceptions (i.e. handicapped, disabled) but after reading various journal articles regarding the power of metaphorical language, I have come to pay much closer attention to the use of language. In the summary, the reviewer refers to Julia as being trapped inside of a twisted body. This opening statement struck me nearly as much as the opening scene of the movie. For someone to label a body as 'twisted' not only idealizes a certain conception of the physical body, but also disempowers any person with any type of physical disability or difference from the 'normal.' This metaphor devalues and insults human beings and at the same time sets up inescapable prison bars on the other side of which lie acceptance. This language is in fact powerful, and some metaphors are more than simply, "convenient designations."</p>
