<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Heartwarming, funny (sometimes hilarious), serious, beautifully filmed - many shots are so perfectly framed you could hang them on your wall. Every performance is perfect for the character in the story, including the goose, Samantha. The change of pace provided by the interweaving of the characters' different stories, the appropriate & beautiful music for the various scenes, the sense of getting to know interesting people, genuine married love between two strong characters as well as the awakening of young love in a setting which has not had sex thrust in their faces, real friendship, the respect paid to religious convictions along with gentle humor at personal foibles - everything adds up to a wonderful film which sticks in the memory and needs just the opening bars of the title song to be brought back gloriously to mind. Truly, one of the all-time great movies.</p>
