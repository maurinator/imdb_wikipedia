<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first Oh, God! movie used a supermarket manager, now this time, God (George Burns) talks to Tracy(Louanne Sirota) a girl whose parents are going through a divorce. She makes cracks about her father's new love. So what does she do? She goes to God, and she creates "Think God". She gets her friends to help her spread the message out. But her parents, think she's out of touch with reality. Even the psychiatrists think the same way. When they committed her to a ward, the children rebel against all the adults in the town. The school was closed by the children, and the principal has his back up against the wall. What does God do? Get her out. The best scene is where he rides the motorcycle with side car. And the police see Tracy in the side car. It's a very good movie to watch. Sending a very powerful message. It was cute at the beginning of the "Tonight Show", where Tracy saw God instead of Johnny Carson. There's no such thing as being too young. God will make a way for you. 5 stars!</p>
