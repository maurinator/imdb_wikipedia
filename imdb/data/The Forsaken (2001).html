<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought this movie was great.  Didn't have too much of the mystical mumbo-jumbo, while still adhering to a lot of vampire lore.  This movie, while similar to Blade and many other vampire movies, brings new blood to an old story.  Let's face it.  The vampire tale has been told about every new way possible.  While it's true it's very gory, this one combines some of the old and some of the new for a unique affect.That and the slashyness of it made my day.</p>
