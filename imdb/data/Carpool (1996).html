<h1>Carpool (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man with an important business meeting finds himself having to take care of the carpool for the neighborhood school children when his wife gets sick. Stopping to get donuts for the kids, things go even more awry when he finds himself a victim of a robbery. However, the situation only gets worse as a desperate man who had been contemplating a bank robbery robs the robbers and takes the man and the kids hostage in their van as his truck is blocked by an armored car. The thing then proceeds into a comedic chase movie. The father finds his kids don't really respect him and they react better to the robber. The end result is everyone gets a lifestyle change, including the original store owner.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The biggest problem with the critically slammed "Car Pool" is its lack of originality. The affable Arnold plays a likeable two-bit carnival owner in need of money who carjacks a gaggle of kids on their way to school in a van driven by Paymer. What ensues are the usual chases and sophomoric nonsense. A busy flick with lots going on, "Car Pool" is a regurgitation of hackneyed stunts and gags which have been done many times before. An okay diversion for the vegetating sofa spud and little more. (D)Note - IMHO Arnold's Razzie is undeserved. It's hard to look good in a really bad film.</p>
