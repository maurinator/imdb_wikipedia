<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'll be honest with you, dear reader, and maybe this will invalidate my opinion for you: I could not even finish watching this.I am probably considered a casual fan of the Addams Family. I like the characters, but I have not seen every episode of their TV series, and I've barely read any of the original comics. But I do like them a great deal.This is not a joke: I figured this movie had to be building up to some kind of climax only to look down at the run time and realize I'd been watching for about 30 minutes. It felt like I'd been watching it FOREVER, and I still had more than half the movie left to go. I turned it off and found something else to watch.The plot is typical Addams Family guff: normies come in to the house and freak out at how weird everybody is. Except this time around, it just doesn't feel weird enough anymore. It's a different house, one that looks considerably less imposing and more like it's on loan from the Beverly Hillbillies. On the inside, things feel much too cramped and cluttered, but rarely ever "spooky." It's too colorful, too well lit, too sunny.Many of the jokes do not feel fresh. New characters are introduced that are literally carbon copies of existing characters, like Gomez's brother Pancho, who also happens to have a weakness for Morticia speaking French, a joke that they continually reference every two minutes for what feels like an eternity.Incidentally, I also had to rewind the movie just to make sure I wasn't missing anything, because you're dropped in to what feels like the middle of the story with very little explanation about who all of these new people are or why they're here. It's awful.And then there's the fact that it's Halloween. When you think of Halloween, you think golden leaves, cooler weather, and jack-o-lanterns. This movie looks like it was shot during the summer in the middle of Hollywood. I mean, the Addamses apparently have palm trees growing in their yard! Palm trees!A lot of the other reviews here on IMDb seem to be from people who saw this growing up and have nostalgia for it, but coming at it from somebody who was born after it aired and only just now watched it in his 30's, it's really not very good at all.</p>
