<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie filled with tons of fun and excitement.  Will Friedle is the highlight of the movie with his goofy quirkiness.  J-love Hewitt wasnt too bad either.  It is a close cry to Hewitts other comedy soon after "Can't Hardly Wait" as far as a cute teeny comedy.  But, the plot does not resemble really.  I really recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.</p>
