<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In the Seventeenth Century, in Maldavia, Princess Asa Vajda and her lover Javutich (Arturo Dominici) are killed by the local population, accused of witchcraft. A mask of Satan is attached to their faces. Princess Asa curses her brother, promising revenge to his descents. The body of Javutich is buried outside the cemetery, and the coffin of Princess Asa is placed in the family's tomb with a cross over it for protection. Two hundred years later, Professor Thomas Kruvajan and his assistant, Dr. Andre Gorobec, are going to a congress in Russia and they accidentally find the tomb. Dr. Thomas breaks the cross, releasing the evil witch. When they are leaving the place, Dr. Andre meets Princess Katia Vajda, descendant of Princess Asa, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Katia is threatened by the witch, who wants to use her body to live again.</p>

At the time of her execution, the princess swore vengeance against her accuser, her brother, and all of his descendants. She quickly resurrects her lover and turns Kruvajan into her vampire servant. When she learns that the present day Princess Katia is identical to her, she sets out to get control of the young woman.</p>
<p>A vengeful witch and her fiendish servant return from the grave and begin a bloody campaign to possess the body of the witch's beautiful look-alike descendant. Only the girl's brother and a handsome doctor stand in her way.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>'Black Sunday's reputation grows with every year that passes, and watching it it's no wonder why! It is not only one of the three or four best horror movies ever made, it is one of the most extraordinary movies of any genre I've ever seen. Mario Bava went on to direct several movies of note after this, but if he hadn't and this was the only movie he made, he would still be a legend. On a relatively small budget, but with buckets of talent, style and originality, Bava conjured up one of the most atmospheric and haunting movies of all time. He may not be the household name he deserves to be, but he is a film makers film maker with an enormous influence on not only subsequent Italian horror giants Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, but directors as diverse as Tim Burton (who rates this as an all time favourite) and even Martin Scorsese.  'Black Sunday' will also be remembered as one of Barbara Steele's most memorable roles. Steele is best known for her work in 60s European horror movies, but in her career worked with everyone from Fellini to Cronenberg. If she is to be remembered for only one movie it will be this one. Steele was one of the most beautiful actresses to ever set foot in front of a camera, and it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the lead (duel) role. The supporting cast is fine, and includes the fondly remembered John Richardson ('One Million Years B.C.'), but this is Steele's show all the way. 'Black Sunday' is still fresh and exciting over forty years after it was originally released. A landmark movie that deserves to be watched again and again!</p>
