<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have read the other reviews and I just did not think this movie was as bad as many of the others are saying. No this is not a great cinematic success and yes a lot of this has been seen before. However, for this type of movie it was at least as good as many other B movies made during that same time. I do not understand how one reviewer can say that Elizabeth Kaitan in not good looking. The story is basically about a women who gets raped at night in a collage classroom by guys she knows from school. The next day she confides what happened to a friend and instead of going to the police, they see this ad and go to this woman who turns out to be a demon. I actually think this would have been a better movie if they eliminated the demon part and just had the victim seek revenge, but then this would really be another "I spit on your grave"Not a great movie but I think it is certainly worth a look.</p>
