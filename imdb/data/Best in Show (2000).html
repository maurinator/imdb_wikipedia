The dog show brings out the essence of the humans. Who will be best in show?</p>
<p>A colorful array of characters compete at a national dog show.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just love this movie / mock-u-mentary! Best in Show is a "mockumentary" made by the same team who brought you the also brilliant "This Is Spinal Tap". It follows several contestants of the Mayflower Dog Show and their dogs. You have a sexually frustrated yuppie couple who met at "Starbucks from across the street", a couple of Gay queens with their Shihtzus, a working class couple with a wife who has had "hundreds of boyfriends", a redneck ventriloquist with his blood hound, and a "Anna Nicole Smith" trophy wife wannabe and her lesbian dog handler. This is just such a wacky bunch - it is a great ride. Some may find it a bit too slow - but I just loved all the subtle humour in it - you can definitely get repeat viewings out of this one! It is a total scream!!</p>
