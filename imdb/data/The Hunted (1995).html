<h1>The Hunted (1995)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Paul is on one of his many business trips to Tokyo, as a computer-chip executive from New York, when he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman. Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult. As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences.</p>
<p>A man visiting Japan picks a local woman. He then takes her to his hotel room. That's when he is attacked and the woman killed. He is brought to the hospital. The doctor tells him that the one who nearly killed is Kinjo, a ninja assassin, and that he is marked for death. The policeman who talks to him tells him that Kinjo is an urban legend. Later someone tries to kill him but a couple saves him. They go on the run. The woman tells him that her husband's cult and Kinjo's have been at war for centuries. They hope that he will make Kinjo come to him so that he could kill him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you are a fan of action films, like the kind Steven Segal is usually seen in, this one is for you. The movie cast is superb with veteran actor John Lone, playing Kinjo. He is usually a good guy but most recently is seen wearing black hats. His acting is incredible as is Yoshio Harada who plays Takeda, a master of Kendo or combat art. Another actor who is more famous for his 'Highlander' series is Christopher Lambert who plays Paul Racine. Adding sympathy, compassion and remarkable loyalty is Joan Chen who plays Kirina. The story is of a businessman who happens to be at the wrong place, when he witnesses a Japanese woman being murdered. Although he is severely wounded, the assassins do not kill him as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts. Recommended for anyone seeking a fine film. ****</p>
