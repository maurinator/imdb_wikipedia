<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Joe however you spell his last name is funny.  I mean real funny.  I love the part where he plays these fantasy bad guys.  The best part is where he makes a fool out of himself when he fights Chuck in a tournament.  The other part I get a laugh out of is the biker and the hot Chinese soup.  Well the rest, of it is a bit sappy, but oh well.</p>
