<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie starts with an ordinary love story of a girl with a military man, they marry without telling the girl's father. The girl's father somehow agrees and asks them to do the marriage again. War breaks out and the husband dies in the war leaving the girl pregnant. Father of girl tells the girl that the child was born dead. The girl marries a stage actor Kumar, played by Sunil Dutt. First half is full of good songs, and beautiful surroundings of Darjeeling. No one can even imagine what the second half can be. The second half is suspense thriller, young Sunil Dutt plays the role of chasing husband very well. Balraj Sahni is, as always, at the top of the affairs, as a police inspector. Balraj Sahni's styles eventually suggest that probably Amitabh copies him a lot of times. Suspense goes on till the last 7-8 minutes of the movie. Raaj Kumar is not so good, but Dutt sahib has done phenomenally well. A must watch movie. I still remember when I was a child I saw this movie first time on Vishal cinema in New Delhi, and my father when I told him that I saw Humraaz, he embraced me. Its a far far better movie than today's suspense thrillers.</p>
