<h1>Hidden City (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sharon Newton (Cassie Stuart) leads the uncooperative James Richards (Charles Dance) into a world of misplaced government secrets, capitalistic artists and bungling secret agents. Will the truth be out? Will the meaning of the hidden film footage spliced into innocuous Government Information Films be discovered? And what is so important about these misplaced medical records? Hidden City is a film set in a London made hidden by the layers of history and secrets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I read all the other comments - are we watching the same movie?? Apparently this director went on to bigger and better things, but this movie was not good, not even for a starter. The premise was okay, but the execution was not. The female lead needed to stop yelling, at the least. She was never a sympathetic character; I thought she was annoying. The dialog was shallow, and did not really develop the characters. Lots of walking, no talking. It was a 15 minute plot in movie form. Charles Dance seems to have spent most of his earlier film career in fuzzy, badly produced movies. I wonder what could have happened had he spent more time in Hollywood, or if Merchant and Ivory had found places for him in their films.... When he has the right material, he is good. I waited for this movie to show more intrigue - all I got was waiting for scenes where there was some real action and some real acting (and scenes that did not feature the female lead). Oh, well.</p>
