<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I usually don't like slamming movies no matter how bad they are, especially when it comes to small movies like this... but "The Caretakers" is easily worst movie I've seen this year.There's not much to say about it, it's amateurish and terrible on every possible level. Scenes didn't know when they should start or when they should end, sound was beyond terrible, FX were on the level of youtube sketch videos, acting was just painful. You're also simply surprised when camera moves to something other then closeup shot. Special nod goes to horrible dialogues. They are just ... one of a kind. Even Twilight or Uwe Boll movies would be embarrassed.</p>
