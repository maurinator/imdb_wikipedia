<h1>Chupke Chupke (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Raghav brags that he can smell a rat or an impersonator automatically, and Dr. Parimal Tripathi decides to take him on - result: funny family slapstick comedy, with a dose of pure Hindi and Urdu thrown in, especially the dialogue delivery by Om Prakash, Dharmendra, and Amitabh Bachchan. Notable songs are :Sare ga ma, ma sa re ga ma...."; "Ab ke sajan sawan me, aag lagegi badan mein, ghata barshegi, magar tarsegi nazar, mil na sakenghe do mahn ek hi aagan mein..."; "Chupke chupke chal di purvaiya, basuri bajaike raas rachaye daiya re daiya, chupke...".</p>
<p>A newly wedded husband plays a practical joke on his wife's family with full support from his wife and friends.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The performance of Amitabh Bachchan stands out amongst some of the greatest names of the 70s.Hrishikesh Mukherjee yet again shows that he is capable of presenting comedy in as sublime manner as he does emotions.Right through the movie not a single scene seems to be out of place.Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore keep you spellbound for the initial part of the movie while Amitabh steals the show in the later.Dharmendra does well in his disguise as a gatekeeper earlier and as a driver for the most part of the movie.Actually this brings out of him his comic talent which would not have been possible with his real character of a serious botany professor.Keshto Mukherjee,Jaya Bhaduri and David are full of energy whenever they appear.The scenes which are bound to make the viewer laugh are the ones in which Dharmendra as the driver Pyare Mohan first meets Raghav and the final climax of the movie in the temple where Amitabh and Jaya are getting married.The music of Sachin Dev Burman is superb as usual.Needless to mention is the brilliance of Lata Mangeshkar in the songs "Ab ke Sajan Sawan Mein" and "Chupke Chupke Chal Re purwaiya".</p>
