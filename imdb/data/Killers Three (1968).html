<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was shot in Randolph County in central North Carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing.  The locations were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. It is not a particularly good movie.  It did have Merle Haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes.The plot is standard shootemup.  The cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies.  The local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise.If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a record copy is available in Asheboro, NC.Actors not credited include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.</p>
