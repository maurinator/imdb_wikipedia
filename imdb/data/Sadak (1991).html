<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>the film i thought was quiet funny because of the villain in which makes you laugh.The only reason i watched this film was because of the songs which were famous at the time,songs like 'Tujhe Apna' and 'Rehne Ko'are songs to be remembered.The film deals with a lot of issues like love,death,nightmare,kill,murder and steal.The film starts on a taxi driver who works day and night but not for money but to take away the images of his sisters death in which he wants to forget.the story it self is good written by Robin Bhatt but some credit has to go to the talented director Mahesh Bhatt!!!Performances,Sanjay it has to be and then Pooja Bhatt, but she did do a great job!</p>
