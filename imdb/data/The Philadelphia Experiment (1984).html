<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>People always seem to write this off as too soft and fuzzy, poorly executed, but it is one of the most charming and fun science fiction films I have ever seen.  The effects are amazing and the direction is way more expressive than you would expect.  As far as science fiction goes, this is no 'Alien' or 'Solaris' and it has logical loopholes you could drive a battleship through, but it is fast paced and lots of fun to watch.  Be prepared to suspend your disbelief with steel girders and rent this.</p>
