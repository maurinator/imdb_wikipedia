<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rajesh, though orphaned at a very age, comes from a very wealthy and noble family, is very insecure and possessive almost to the point of an obsession. As a child he had loved a girl named Meena, and when she tragically passes away, Rajesh substituted her with a doll. When he found that another young boy had touched the doll, he starts a fight with him, and ends up killing him. Years later, Rajesh has grown up, but still has the doll in his closet drawer, he has fallen in love with a woman named Meena and wants to marry her. He even gives Girdharilal, Meena's dad, some money so that he can get his eldest daughter, Parvati, married to Prem, the son of money-lender, Mayadas. He introduces Meena to his close and best friend, Dr. Shekhar, and soon gets formally engaged to Meena. Thereafter, Rajesh and Meena have an automobile accident, in which Rajesh becomes paralyzed and must be confined in a wheelchair. It is then that Rajesh finds out that Shekhar and Meena are having an affair, and the old murderous and possessive hatred, that he had managed to conceal, surfaces again - and this time it will be Shekhar's turn.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is certainly a movie for those of you who like films to delve into the psyche of human beings-- and what interesting creatures we mortals be. At first this seems to be a regular but well made indian drama, but as the tragedy unfolds (and folds upon it's unfortunate players), you really start feeling for the protagonists. It also has a good deal of surprises and twists of plot that make the normally often stale 3 hours of indian movie watching into an enjoyable experience. The songs aren't that great but the movie is well worth watching. And don't flinch because it was made before you were born! It deserves at least an 8.5/10</p>
