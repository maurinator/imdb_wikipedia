<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of mercenaries is hired to spring Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison in Berlin.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you're expecting lots of action and gunplay, don't bother; you'll surely be disappointed. The movie focuses more on intrigue and endless spy games. The complicated story maintains interest throughout, but ultimately it's all for naught. Still, there is a sly performance by Edward Fox to be enjoyed (if you can stand his deliberately curious accent!) (**)</p>
