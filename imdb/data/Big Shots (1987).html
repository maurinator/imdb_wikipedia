<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Big Shots (1987) is a fun little film about two teens that are polar opposites of each other and the struggles they go through after forming a working relationship between each other. I enjoyed it very much when I was younger. The bad guys in the picture are painted with such broad strokes I was expecting them to all be chomping on big cigars whilst laughing out loud. The film is what it is and nothing more. Recommended.B.</p>
