<h1>Coast to Coast (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two guys meet, one American, a deserter from the US army, one Brit, and they are drawn together by their mutual love of Soul music. Neither being gainfully employed they decide to start a mobile disco service for fellow soul lovers, which leads them to buy an ice cream van, and the adventure begins. Before long they find themselves on the run from the bad guys and the police.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have been trying to get a copy of this wonderful movie for years as my VHS tape was worn out long ago. I have been looking for a replacement for some time. Then I found Ken Hill on this site who was able to provide me with a DVD. I contacted him on Monday this week and I have just received my DVD, Friday. How about that for service? I emailed him and he responded with a detailed background of how he came by his source film and was very open on the process of purchase and delivery. It comes in a proper DVD case with cover and DVD label, personalised if you wish with your name. For those of you out there who are after a copy I can recommend Ken for his service and integrity.</p>
