<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Beyond Rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made. Superbly directed by John Boorman, and intensly acted by Patricia Arquette, this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's. The story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening, and never lets go. After seeing the film, the viewer will never be able to forget "Beyond Rangoon".  The film made little money at the box office, and is little known, but should be high profile.  Watching it, you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience.  It is a very important and moving film, and should be seen by everyone.</p>
