<h1>Dance with Me (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young Cuban Rafael just buried his mother, and comes to Houston to meet his father John for the first time. The difficult part is that John doesn't know he is Rafael's father. John runs a dance studio, and everyone prepares for the World Open Dance championship in Las Vegas. It soon becomes clear Rafael is a very good dancer, and Ruby is the biggest hope for the studio at the championship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie instantly became a favorite of mine, it's full of warmth and charm, the characters are real and enchanting, and Chayanne (Rafael) is absolutely captivating! I could hardly take my eyes off of him during the entire movie.  Watch for the scene where he dances in the sprinklers, he's absolutely charming!  (I could go on for days about him but I'll spare you). Vanessa Williams (Ruby) is every bit his equal though, not only is she breathtakingly beautiful, but her dancing is some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. (I still can't figure out how she dances so well in those shoes!) As for the supporting cast, Joan Plowright (Bea) can even steal a scene from Chayanne!  She's adorable as one of the older, but very enthusiastic dance students.  Her second performance in the Las Vegas competition is another one of my favorite scenes.  Do not miss this movie! (Now, where do I sign up for Chayanne's fan club???)</p>
