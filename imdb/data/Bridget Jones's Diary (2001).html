<h1>Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bridget Jones is an average woman struggling against her age, her weight, her job, her lack of a man, and her many imperfections. As a New Year's Resolution, Bridget decides to take control of her life, starting by keeping a diary in which she will always tell the complete truth. The fireworks begin when her charming though disreputable boss takes an interest in the quirky Miss Jones. Thrown into the mix are Bridget's band of slightly eccentric friends and a rather disagreeable acquaintance who Bridget cannot seem to stop running into or help finding quietly attractive.</p>
<p>Can a single woman over 30, who smokes too much, drinks too much, and has a tendency to say whatever comes into her mind, find her place in the world... and a man? Bridget Jones is an assistant at a London book publisher, feeling time pass her by. When Daniel Cleaver, her boss, starts flirting with her in a vulgar way, she plunges straight in. An affair ensues and she's head over heels. She also keeps running into Mark Darcy, a reserved even stiff barrister who has known her since she was a child young enough to frolic naked in his wading pool, seems to look down his nose at her, and hates Cleaver (truth is, Daniel may be a bit of a bounder). What are Bridget's choices?</p>
<p>Bridget Jones is 32 years old and can't seem to find the right man. Her mother keeps setting her up with dorks; she and her boss have a sexual attraction, but his character seems less than admirable. She resolves to try harder...</p>
<p>Bridget Jones' life couldn't get worse: she slept with her boss, is gaining weight and keeps screwing up in public events. Mark Darcy doesn't make it any better, he seems to be everywhere. The stiff top notch lawyer which Bridget can't help, but find very sexy. From bunny tails, to drunk fits, Bridget seems to be living her life with much 'inner poise'.</p>
<p>A British woman is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Speaking as a singleton of a certain age, I found this move dead on. Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal.  The plot line stayed pretty true to the book with a few exceptions but the tone stayed the same.  I know when I went to see this with a female friend there were many men in the audience who looked like they had been dragged there but 5 minutes into the move they were laughing as hard (if not harder) than the women in the audience.  This is definitely not just a "chick flick." Renee Zellweger was a perfect Bridget.  When I first heard that she was going to play this role, I was skeptical but after I saw it(which I did twice, so far!) I couldn't imagine anyone else with such a mixture of cynicism and innocence.  Bravo to the casting of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as Cleaver and Darcy, respectively.  If this movie doesn't win some Oscars it will be a crying shame.</p>
