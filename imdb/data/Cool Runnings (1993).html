<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of John Candy's best movies.  An excellent cast makes this a real feel good film telling the story of the first Jamaican bobsled team and their efforts to overcome the prejudices of a previous all white sport.  You'll enjoy every minute of this flick and have a better understanding of what it takes to join the Olympic movement.  For the entire family.</p>
