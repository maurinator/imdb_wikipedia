<h1>Psycho Beach Party (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Spoof of 1960's Beach Party/Gidget surfing movies mixed with slasher horror films stars Lauren Ambrose as Florence Forrest, a not-so-innocent girl in 1960's Malibu who becomes "Chicklet" the first girl surfer at Malibu Beach, only Florence suffers from dissociative identity disorder and occasionally her alter ego Ann Bowman, a sexually aggressive, foul-speaking girl, comes out in which during that time several beach goers are found murdered. The suspects include Chicklet herself, surfer Kanaka, B-horror film actress Bettina Barnes, exchange student Lars, and even Chicklet's own mother.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A silly, sick, hilarious movie!  We had so much fun--saw it on a rainy night in NYC; the theater was packed and a rollicking good campy time was had by all!You'll remember many gems of dialogue--especially a line from Nicholas Brendon that rivals fellow "Buffy" cast member Allyson Hannigan's shocker in "American Pie"!Anyone with the slightest affection for those AIP beach movies will love this one.  Terrific soundtrack too--why no album???</p>
