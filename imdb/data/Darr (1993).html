<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Darr is not a mere psychopathic movie it is actually a real portrayal of obsession.The movie is about a boy who is obsessed for a girl.The story was unique as this topic has never been explored in Indian cinema.It was not a copy of any Hollywood flick,it was just inspired from it.The screenplay was good and its flow was smooth.The film could have been shorter.1st half of the movie was lousy but 2nd half was good.The movie also memorable for Shahrukh's performance.He was great.This is among the best performances of his career.His body language,expressions,vibration of his sound everything was superb.This movie proves why he is called the king khan.Sunny was usual doing what he does.He was average.The way in which he carries out the rescue mission in the beginning of the movie was too bad.Juhi was good and acted well.Anupam was nice and provided the much needed comic relief.Music was good especially the title song was so charming.But placement of songs in the movie was bad.Locations are good.The movie needs a serious editing and could have been shorter.Yash ji was a great director and this movie proves it yet again.It is a must watch for cinema lovers. 8.1 out of 10 is my final rating.</p>
