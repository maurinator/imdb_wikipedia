<h1>Deadly Advice (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mother rules the house with an iron hand and has such power over her daughters that they see themselves as becoming old unmarried, maids. Jodie has feelings for the local doctor, a man much older than her, for which her mother strongly disapproves. Beth finds a relationship with a male stripper in Bristol, but sees nothing in the future with Mother around. While both girls would like to be rid of Mother, nothing happens until Jodie sees images of H. R. Armstrong, the man who put the town on the map by dispatching his un-loving wife.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Deadly Advice is a brilliant flim from start to finish. I love the way Iris treats her two daughters as kids and jodie and her sister are really funny and good actresses. And Bunny....! don't even get me started! He is so fu**ing GORGEOUS! His face his body i could go on and on! The idea of the film is brill and the actors are very good which makes the film as good as it is. I give it 10/10 and i recommend it to anyone who wants a good comedy!!</p>
