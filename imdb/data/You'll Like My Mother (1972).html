<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Duke, Harris, and Thomas are well worth watching for their understated performances in this moody character study.  Director Johnson elicited a range of nuances and power from Duke that no other director has been able to achieve.  Harris is spellbinding as a woman for whom bitterness is a highball and acrimony is champagne.</p>
