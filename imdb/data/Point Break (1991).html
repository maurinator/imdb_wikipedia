<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie has energy. The story is kinda goofy, but the direction from Kathryn Bigelow has the right amount of pacing and atmosphere. The chase scene midway through the film is a breath-taking example of what film-makers can do, if they have energy and vision. This movie is pure entertainment and a blast to watch.</p>
