<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is strange.  First of all, Alan Alda is TOTALLY different from his noticeable character from M*A*S*H.  This story tells about a couple that rents a house on the beach from Alda who plays a veteran and is now handicapped from the knees down.  As the couple starts settling down, Aldo starts snooping around the house offering friendly gestures such as wine and beer.  He likes the wife who can do without the raspy, whiney voice and all she talks about her immature husband.  Then he discovers that the husband is all she is into and Alda looses interest and just likes her as a friend. Alda ownes two vicious Dobbermans that attack and guard on command and scare them half to death.  As the story continues, Alda decides to party with the couple and invites the husband to come out with him at sunset.  Nothing is mentioned of what he is to do, but the next morning, Alda is angrily waiting the husband to come out and he finally does.  Then Alda starts action crazy like he is a drill sargent and treating the husband like a recruit giving out commands and ordering them to be carried out.  The husband acts as if this is silly, but finally obeys.  After all of this, the couple is held hostage in their own house guarded by the ferocious dogs.  They find a way to get out and Alda has made it so that they wouldn't.  The couple and Alda fight it out and something happens, but it should have been the other way around.  Alda was good as the crazy Mr. Richie but his character could have been pepped up a bit to make him more crazier.  The people that played the couple were foolish.  I give it a 5.</p>
