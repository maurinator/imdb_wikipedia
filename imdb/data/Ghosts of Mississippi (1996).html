<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This could have been a pretty good ninety minute film. Unfortunately it is 130 minutes and the extra 40 minutes is almost fatal. There is an important story being told, that is somewhat dulled by way too much extraneous material, along with some distracting family distress, and child coddling. Less would have been best in the case of "Ghosts of Mississippi. The acting by Alec Baldwin, Whoppi Goldberg, and especially James Woods is totally acceptable, but the movie drags on way too long. I realize being based on fact, the writers were somewhat restricted, but I would have preferred a leaner story, without the distracting extras involving wives and children. - MERK</p>
