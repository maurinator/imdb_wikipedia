<h1>Torch Song Trilogy (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Tony Award-winning actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein re-creates his role as the unsinkable Arnold Beckoff in this film adaptation of the smash Broadway play TORCH SONG TRILOGY. A very personal story that is both funny and poignant, TORCH SONG TRILOGY chronicles a New Yorker's search for love, respect and tradition in a world that seems not especially made for him. From Arnold's hilarious steps toward domestic bliss with a reluctant school teacher, to his first truly promising love affair with a young fashion model, Arnold's greatest challenge remains his complicated relationship with his mother. But armed with a keenly developed sense of humor and oftentimes piercing wit, Arnold continues to test the commonly accepted terms of endearment--and endurance--in a universally affecting story that confirms that happiness is well worth carrying a torch for.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Torch Song Trilogy is so called because its acts were originally presented one-by-one, months apart, at the off-Broadway La Mama Theater.  It is done with a sparse set and few props, letting the incredibly funny, amazingly touching script fuel the play.The movie version is done much more realistically, and it works! Things that are merely discussed in the play are shown to viewers. The cast is wonderfully realistic (Brian Kerwin is a bit stiff, but it works for the character of Ed.) and the script is just as good as the stage play.  So many books and plays are adapted into something that is barely recognizable, but Fierstein makes his own script into something even more special. The story benefits from the larger scope allowed by the movie.We get to SEE the drag club, the bars, Arnold's (bunny-motif) apartment, Ed's country house and other locations merely hinted at in the play.  The scenes that take place during and after the visit to the country house are somewhat confusing on stage, performed in a huge bed, but are beautifully edited in the movie.  Best of all is Arnold's best friend, Murray, only talked about in the stage production.  But in the movie, he's brought to magnificent life by Ken Page, filling the screen with his usual warmth and wit.Harvey Fierstein has said that he hopes TST is like an Indian dress, made beautiful by all the little mirrors that decorate it.  And truly, it is seeing and hearing *ourselves* that makes this script sparkle.  You don't have to be a female impersonator to understand love and loss and laughter. This is NOT just a movie for gay men.</p>
