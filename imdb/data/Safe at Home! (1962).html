<h1>Safe at Home! (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Young Hutch Lawton brags to his Little League buddies that his dad knows Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris. Forced to "put up or shut up" Hutch goes to spring training camp where he is lectured about honesty being the best policy. He returns to face his buddies with the truth to find the entire Little League team invited to camp.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was about entertainment....not "the art of acting"...for that you need to see a movie in the style of Felini. But it is great for kids and shows a lot of respect for feelings. We really enjoyed it and showed a lot of old Fort Lauderdale scenes that were reminiscent of the Beach Blanket Bingo days. Loved the scene where Bill Massey was at the door of the Yankee Clipper, trying to get past the doorman Woody Woodbury. Those two should have had their own show. What a Hoot!....did someone say Hoot!, just saw that movie also...great as well.</p>
