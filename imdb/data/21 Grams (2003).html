<h1>21 Grams (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is the story of three well-meaning but flawed people: Paul Rivers, an ailing mathematician lovelessly married to an English émigré; Christina Peck, an upper-middle-class suburban housewife, happily married homemaker with two young daughters, with hiding a secret past; and Jack Jordan, an ex-convict who has found in his Christian faith the strength to live a law-abiding life and raise a family. They will be brought together by a terrible accident that will change their lives. By the final frame, none of them will be the same as they will have learnt harsh truths about love, faith, courage, desire and guilt, and how chance can change our worlds irretrievably, forever.</p>
<p>A freak accident brings together a critically ill mathematician, a grieving mother, and a born-again ex-con.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you haven't seen many movies you might enjoy 21 grams.  Otherwise you are likely to see straight through this rehashed plot. The only redeeming factor is the quality cinematography.  21 grams steals ideas from films like Magnolia and Memento.  It tries to make a simple story about people who make their problems worse, interesting by reordering events in time.  This is a popular fad in films these days which reminds me of choose your own adventure books, because this is how I imagine these films are created. Instead of providing real content the movie is a hodgepodge of gimmicks. A little life and death drama, some action, some mystery, some blood and guts give it a big budget -- Hey we've got a blockbuster.  To top it off the 21 grams premise is weak and never developed and has very little to do with the rest of the film.  You can leave this movie with the impression that you learned something about life, but just what was it?  Instead watch Amores Perros a quality film by the same Director/Writer duo.</p>
