Tony loses interest in Fontaine, and turns his attention to her young step daughter, who uses him to get back at Fontaine for cheating on her father.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Far from it, ten times more people were into disco and this film is probably a better reflection of the late 70s than Jubilee, with its Britain is finished, let's celebrate all that's grotty and rotten about the country. After all, where would you rather be, in some smashed up slum in punk gear, or down some high class disco being seduced by Joan Collins, what we would nowadays call a classy MILF. I am sure millions who attended their local Roxy every Saturday imagined they were in Hobos and flocked to their local fleapit to see what proved to be Joan Collins comeback after such dross as Empire of the Ants. Also the soundtrack, about the best thing about The Stud, sold in huge numbers.However, the film is complete schlock and little better than other soft porn of the period. It does have a sort of so bad it's good feel to it, but is a rather sleazy, dull film that has dated badly. I know as a seventies nostalgist I would watch it if it was on, if only for the music, but I would give The Stud one look and then put it back in its case as the acting is hammy and the plot is threadbare.</p>
