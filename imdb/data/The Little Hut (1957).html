<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Two men and a woman are stranded on a desert island. If they are English, there is no problem: They haven't been introduced. If they are Spanish, there is no problem: One of the men will kill the other. If they are Italian, there is no problem: The woman will kill one of the men. If they are American, there is no problem: They will be too busy talking about business. If they are French, there is no problem. Alas for this story, the two men are English, and the woman is American, and they already knew one another well -- perhaps too well. The story, from a French play more risqu√©, or even downright explicit, is reasonably plausible, by Hollywood standards, rather well acted, but so badly edited it is a crime. There are way too many scenes that do not match: For example, from one angle, a character has his arms crossed, then the next shot shows him with his arms at his side. "The Little Hut" is full of such bad continuity or bad editing or bad directing ... or combination thereof. Still Ava Gardner, an enchanting and under-rated actress, in her various abbreviated costumes almost makes this worthwhile all by herself. Almost.</p>
