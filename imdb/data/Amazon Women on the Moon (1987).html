<h1>Amazon Women on the Moon (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A series of short sketches, most of which parody late-night television and the low-budget movies one often finds there. Other skits include a man being attacked by his apartment, a funeral hosted by classic comedians, and a teen-age boy's big night turning into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Channel 8 WIDB-TV is airing the 1954 (or is is 1957? or 1955?) Universal International science-fiction classic "Amazon Women on the Moon" as part of its late night programming. The station is experiencing problems with the airing. To fill air time, the viewers are instead shown various other old movies, movie trailers, commercials, public service announcements, infomercials, talk shows and other programming in-between the few clips available of the featured movie. The viewers include a man being attacked by his apartment, a man with a special remote control, and a man whose life is reviewed by movie critics and who is given a tribute by a cavalcade of classic stand-up comics.</p>
<p>A spoof 1950s sci-fi movie, interspersed with various comedy sketches concerning late-night television.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Boy, do i love this movie! Im not saying it didnt have any flaws. Id say about 80% of it was very funny. My absolute favorite sketches are the Harvey Pitnik critics corner/funeral sketches. The critics really tore Harvey a new one (LOL)! All the roasters (comedians) were great, but my favorite was Rip Taylor, especially when he says "you know the old saying in show business, get off quick, like Harvey on his wedding night!" When i heard that, I laughed so hard, that i probably have an uncured hernia to this day from it. Of course i cant leave out the blacks without soul/ Don no soul Simmons albums (my second favorite), Arnesio Hall, bs or not, pirates, titans, and every Vangoe must go, and the Amazon Women movie itself. These were all very funny. I cant wait to get this on dvd one day. 8 STARS OUT OF 10.</p>
