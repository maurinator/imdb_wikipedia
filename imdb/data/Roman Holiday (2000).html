<h1>Roman Holiday (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rome, 44 BC: An alchemist creates an impenetrable armor for Caesar. 2000: Sydney and Nigel are on a trip, so Claudia decides to help Sydney's friend Roger to find Caesar's Armor. But relic hunting is not her strongest talent.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Roger Penrose claims he knows how to find Caesar's breastplate. Wearing this artifact makes a man invulnerable, it is said (obviously, Caesar was not wearing it on the Ides of March). Penrose is murdered at the airport when he is on the way to Rome. While Sydney and Nigel are still busy elsewhere, Claudia decides to fly to Rome on her own, her most dangerous mission ever. Sydney and Nigel need to follow her to Rome urgently, before something happens to her.Good episode with a lot of fresh, original ideas. Claudia is in the middle of the action for once, while the search for the relic is less important this time. Besides, we get a great gladiator fight scene, Tia Carrere could challenge Xena here.</p>
