<h1>The Carey Treatment (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Peter Carey is a pathologist at a Boston hospital. The daughter of the hospital's Chief of Staff dies after an illegal abortion goes wrong, and Carey's friend and colleague Dr. David Tao is accused of performing the abortion. Carey doesn't buy it, and so he digs deeper, angering the girl's father in the process. Questions abound: Who performed the abortion? Was the girl really pregnant? And what does it have to do with stolen morphine, blackmail attempts, and a mysterious and dangerous masseur?</p>
<p>Moving from Palo Alto, Dr. Peter Carey has just started working as a pathologist at Boston Memorial Hospital. Beyond beginning a relationship with dietitian Georgia Hightower, Peter's focus quickly changes from his work at the hospital to helping his friend, Dr. David Tao, who has just been implicated in the murder of fifteen year old Karen Randall, the daughter of the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. J.D. Randall. The story is that Karen was four months pregnant, went to Dr. Tao who was known to perform illegal abortions, and she bled out from the abortion gone wrong, Karen who herself implicated Dr. Tao to her mother just before she died. David admits that he did perform abortions, that Karen did come to him for such help, but that he refused to help her at her advanced stage of pregnancy. He further states that his motive in performing abortions was not profit driven - as he only charged $25 to cover lab fees - but rather to help girls who would have gone to quacks to get the job done otherwise. Peter gets little help from the Randalls, who are outwardly concerned for their daughter, but inwardly concerned about their and the hospital's reputation. But as Peter goes through his investigation, he places his own life in danger as he gets closer to the truth.</p>
<p>At a Boston hospital, Dr. Carey becomes an amateur sleuth to help clear a colleague who's accused of botching an illegal abortion that kills a 15 year old girl.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>James Coburn plays a pathologist who is investigating the death of the fifteen-year-old daughter of the chief of medicine, who has died of a botched abortion that has been blamed on his colleague (James Hong), who is an illegal abortionist on the side. A lot of people today would be horrified of a movie where the hero is actually trying to help out an abortion doctor. But this was 1972 and people tend to forget that everything wasn't all bright and wonderful back when abortion was still illegal either (I don't personally take a side on the abortion debate, but I have a problem with people on either side who think the issue is in any way morally clear-cut and unambiguous--it's not now and never was). But before anyone goes bemoaning "liberal Hollywood", there's also a real "Dirty Harry" element to this movie, like a scene where Coburn essentially tortures information out of a drug-addicted suspect by denying her treatment. This particular scene should offend liberals everywhere (as well as anyone else who's ever heard of the Hyppocratic Oath).But the fact that this movie might offend both conservatives AND liberals is exactly what I liked about it. The real world is morally messy and no one person is ever 100 percent morally righteous, and the many, many Hollywood movies that try to make things morally simplistic and their protagonists morally pure actually do a great disservice in many ways. Of course, the moral complications in this particular movie seem to be more the result of a confused production than anyone's clever intentions. Still I always find an interesting failure like this much more enjoyable than a boring success (like whatever old TV show they're making into a major motion picture this week). And in 1970's Hollywood there was a whole string of these kind of interesting failures, which is why I find that whole period so fascinating.This movie definitely has some problems as other have said. Jennifer O'Neil is completely wasted, and the basic plot is riddled with holes (i.e. noboby but the protagonist notices that the botched operation was very obviously not the work of a trained doctor). Coburn isn't bad though, and this movie does kind of anticipate both "Coma" and the popular TV series "Quincy MD". Not good, but interesting, and certainly worth seeing.</p>
