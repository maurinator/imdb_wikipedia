<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Cute and charming movie.  Bacall and Peck have great chemistry as a newlywed couple who have more differences than they think starting out together. Bacall is funny and chic in her gorgeous gowns by Helen Rose and Peck is funny and charming as a gruff sports writer.  This is a true gem.</p>
