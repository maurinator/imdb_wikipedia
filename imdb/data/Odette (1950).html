<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Anna Neagle was better known for this film than any of the others she has made. A story of a French mother with three young children living in Britain, who is recruited by the spy service to return to Nazi occupied France as an undercover spy. Neagle plays Odette. Her handler (Peter Churchill) in France is played by Trevor Howard and there is also a young Peter Ustinov as a message transmitter.The initial part of the film is bland with Odette delivering and retrieving messages which has little or no tension. However once Marius Goring enters as a German officer who seems to despise the Nazis, things take an interesting turn. Odette and Churchill are captured and Odette is tortured by the Nazis which is the harrowing part of the film.Neagle, Goring, Ustinov and Howard are all excellent but the film is let down with the less than rip roaring spy adventures at the beginning and the latter part would now deemed to be too tame, even though good use of make up is made for the months of abuse at the prison camp.Even though Odette is starved of food you cannot help noticing that actress still looks slightly plump. Its details like this that lets the film down.</p>
