<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is actually a very good film. A great watch, and tense all they way through. It was an incredible mix of scripting, acting, dialogue and cinematography that uncovered an understanding of truth on both sides of the issue.In this film, Omar Epps plays a rookie, undercover cop, whose first small assignment actually leads him into the number one crime syndicate in all of Cincinnati. The inexperienced cop uses his urban upbringing and street smarts to get him to the top, where he really has to decide which side he wants to be on. Also LL Cool J showed that he had much talent in acting as in Hip-Hop music. Omar Epps is also great, and Nia Long, nice eye candy from fresh prince of Bel Air and Stanley Tucci, who added further weight to the cast. The soundtrack is great too, especially at the end with the Mobb Deep track, it's a perfect fit.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</p>
