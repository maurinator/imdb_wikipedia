<h1>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The mad and evil scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester, has created an evil little scheme that is bound to give him world global domination but first thing's first. He plans to torment Mike Nelson and the robots by sending them a real stinker of a film to watch called, "This Island Earth." He is convinced that this movie will drive them insane. And since the guys cannot control when the movie begins or ends, they are forced to witness the true horror that is this awful movie that has a lobster creature dressed in slacks. But will this be the ultimate cheese that breaks the boys' spirits? It's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil the plans of the scientist and to save the Earth.</p>
<p>The evil scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester locks Mike Nelson and two robots in a spacecraft to watch terrible low-budget movies as part of his scheme to conquer the world. He projects 1954 "This Island Earth" (Title (Brazil): "Guerra Entre Planetas") with the intention of driving them crazy. However, the trio laughs and makes funny comments in every scene and dialogs, having good-time instead, and Dr. Forrester's ambitious plan does not work.</p>
<p>This movie is basically a deluxe version of the popular cult-TV favorite 'Mystery Science Theater 3000.' In the movie, as in the TV-series, Dr. Clayton Forrester forces Mike Nelson and his two robots to watch bad B-Movies. As these movies are screened for them (and us), we see the theater seats and them silhouetted against the bottom of the screen. Their running commentary riffs off of the film and each other and their sophomoric jabs at humor form a continuous patter not unlike what might be heard among the audience, if these films were to be shown at a frat party. This particular episode features 'This Island Earth' (1954).</p>
<p>Mike Nelson and his robot companions watch and give their comments about This Island Earth (1955).</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The evil scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulieu) locks Mike Nelson (Michael J. Nelson) and two robots in a spacecraft to watch terrible low-budget movies as part of his scheme to conquer the world. He projects 1954 "This Island Earth" (Title (Brazil): "Guerra Entre Planetas") with the intention of driving them crazy. However, the trio laughs and makes funny comments in every scene and dialogs, having good-time instead, and Dr. Forrester's ambitious plan does not work. The first time I saw "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie" on 01 February 2000 I loved it a lot and I gave a nine. I had watched the cheese "This Island Earth" a few months ago and the comments of Mike Nelson and the two robots made me laugh a lot. Today I have just watched this film again and it is still hilarious, but my rating is lower this time. "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie" was released in Brazil on VHS by CIC-Universal Distributor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Filme Mais Idiota do Mundo" ("The Most Idiot Movie of the World")</p>
