<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of my friends once asked me to talk about Dolls, since it was a movie that really charmed me, and it's one of my favorites. I really had to think carefully before starting to give any description... How can you describe a movie like this one? You should see it.Too hard to concentrate in words the symbols, atmospheres, emotions, silence, and everything you can find in this great work if you're thoughtful and receptive enough.I'd really not recommend it if you like "light" and fast paced films, that's for sure. Dolls is so sad it sticks to your soul for hours, and its best parts are the ones you can catch from images, metaphors and details, that speak and live more than the plot itself and its dialogs can do. This film is made for thinking, and it has a very special way to show thoughts, not for everyone in my humble opinion. Dolls is 3 love stories, but I think love isn't the "main" theme... I'd say it covers a series of details, feelings and absurd things. The characters are always stroke by a world with a series of incidents and expectations that brings 'em far away from their dreams. Dolls is aesthetic, and poetry.</p>
