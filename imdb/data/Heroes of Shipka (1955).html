<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Oh my God! I just watched this movie for a first time, and all I can say that it's truly great. Absolutely epic masterpiece from notable Soviet director Sergey Vasilyev. First of all this is a war/battle movie so it contains a lot of battle scenes which is truly epic, especially the part with infantry charge on Pleven. Even 55 years after the day that scenes were filmed they still looks like one of the best battle scenes of all time. Acting and direction here are also well. Sergey Vasilyev's crew and cast of best Soviet and Bulgarian actors did an outstanding work in that movie. Yeah, some people may say that "Heroes of Shipka" also contains some of Soviet's Marxist propaganda, but come on! There is only a little bit of it in the whole movie, so you just can left it behind. And nope it is not boring at all. I watched it "on one breath" as we say in Russia =) So if you likes a well done war epic/battle dramas - this movie is just for you. I recommend it.</p>
