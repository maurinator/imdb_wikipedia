<h1>Sweet and Lowdown (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A comedic biopic focused on the life of fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray. Ray was an irresponsible, free-spending, arrogant, obnoxious, alcohol-abusing, miserable human being, who was also arguably the best guitarist in the world. We follow Ray's life: bouts of getting drunk, his bizzare hobbies of shooting rats and watching passing trains, his dreams of fame and fortune, his strange obsession with the better-known guitarist Django Reinhardt, and of course, playing his beautiful music.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, jazz guitarist Emmet Ray idolizes Django Reinhardt, faces gangsters and falls in love with a mute woman.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved this.  A story of a fictional character, portrayed as documentary, the viewer is drawn in, particularly by the believable performances from all the cast, Samantha Morton and Sean Penn in particular.  They both deserved the nominations they received for these roles.  Morton especially since she had no words, only expressions, to carry meaning, and she succeeds.In addition, if you like jazz, there is simply some fantastic music to be heard.  Apparently Penn had never played guitar before this movie, and while it is unlikely that he was able to play to this standard, he nevertheless carries off miming very well.Great music, great film.  10/10</p>
