<h1>How to Frame a Figg (1971)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Don Knotts is Hollis Figg, the dumbest bookkeeper in town. When the city fathers buy a second-hand computer to cover up their financial shenanigans, they promote Figg to look after things, knowing he'll never catch on. Their plan backfires when Figg becomes self-important and accidentally discovers their plot.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>...it is still entertaining and interesting. Many people have complained that this is Don on autopilot. Nothing could be further from the truth. Granted, the FILMMAKERS were on autopilot. The overt kiddie flick tone of "Figg" was obviously an attempt to counter the perceived flack the studio got from the mild sexual overtones of Knotts'previous film, the classic "The Love God?". And "Figg" is a goofy, childish film in many ways--similar to the worst of Disney's live action romps like "Herbie Goes Bannanas" or "The Million Dollar Duck.".But the film does do one thing rightit changes up the standard Don Knotts film character. As everyone notes, the standard character in Knotts' five classic Universal flicks is basically Barney Fife. But it's more complex than that. In the first four films, the Knotts character was invariably a naïf loser who is put upon, becomes an undeserved success, gets a big head, is brought down again, and eventually perseveres. Through it all, however, he is always a nice guy. This, however, is only half of the Fife persona. The other half is what I like to call the "Dick Barney," as in "The Barney Who Acts Like a Dick." This angrier Barn is evident in the "Andy Griffith" episodes in which Barney is in charge of Gomer or Goober. Seeing them as inferiors, the inferiority-complex riddled Barney is always compelled to order them around, yell at them, and call them stupidin other words, to just treat them like a dick. This kind of interaction was the source of many hilarious "slow burn" Barney tantrums.The Knotts we see in "Figg" is not the Nice Barney, it is definitely the Dick Barney. So, even though the plot of "Figg" is pretty much a cookie-cutter slice of the standard Knott's formula, the lead character is a definite change for the film series. The substitute Gomer in "Figg" is Knott's best friend Prentiss, played by voice artist Frank Welker. And Prentiss makes Gomer look like a freakin' genius (in fact Welker's performance is so over the top childlike that he seems literally retardedbut no one really seems to notice). Knotts' Figg character verbally rails on Prentiss without mercy, eyes popping, veins bulging, his whole body vibrating with rage. IT IS A RIOT TO BEHOLD!So, even though the script, supporting cast, and direction of "Figg" were all substandard, Knotts himself did at least try to give us something different instead of simply rehashing the same ole same ole. Gotta give him credit for that!</p>
