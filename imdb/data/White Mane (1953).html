<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A boy comes across a white-haired wild horse in the Camargue. Ranchers seek to capture the horse, but it escapes. What will happen as the boy sets out to find the horse again? The film is set in the gorgeous landscape of the Camargue, a marsh area in the south of France where the river Rhone meets the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>In the Camargue, France, ranchers go after wild horses led by a leader, "White Mane," which escapes capture time after time. A small boy who witnesses the horse's furious fight for its freedom makes friends with the horse after the trackers supposedly give him up to whomever can capture him. They change their minds when they see the boy has tamed him and take off after the horse again, with the boy on his back. Both boy and horse, fed up with the continual fight for freedom and peace, and the duplicity of men, head out to sea as the men plead with the boy to turn back. (Winner of the Cannes Grand Prize in category in 1953.)</p>
<p>Herds of wild horses roam the tidal marshes of the Camargue region of south coastal France. A white stallion with a long mane is the head of one such herd. Wranglers attempt unsuccessfully to capture this stallion, which does not like humans. Folco, a fisherboy, witnesses the attempted capture. He becomes obsessed himself with capturing the stallion. The stallion has a different reaction to Folco than other humans, but would much rather be with his herd than to be captured by anyone. As the wranglers and Folco individually try to capture the stallion, the stallion itself has a changing relationship to the rest of its herd and as a result to Folco himself.</p>
<p>In the Camargue, France, a young boy bonds with a white haired horse that escaped from ranchers.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Albert Lamorisse is mostly known for his beloved classic 'The Red Balloon', but before that he made this 'White Mane', which is almost as good. Although 'White Mane' is not absolutely perfect, it certainly is and feels authentic. I could say this is a must for anyone who loves horses. It is, that I can't deny. But in my book one doesn't necessarily have to love horses to enjoy this. It's all a matter of liking this sort of films.This short film is about a wild stallion in a wild region of France and his friendship with a fearless and adventurous young boy. The film tells how they meet and how they develop their friendship. This boy becomes the only human really worthy of the stallion's trust.The beauty of the cinematography is one of the best things about this. What we see is pure and natural, a "wilder" France not often seen in movies (that is, as far as I know). The boy is wonderfully portrayed by Alain Emery. The boy and the stallion have a perfect chemistry.This should definitely be on Top 250.</p>
