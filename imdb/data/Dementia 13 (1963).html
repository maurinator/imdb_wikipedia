<h1>Dementia 13 (1963)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When her husband John has a heart attack while out in a rowboat on the lake, Louise Haloran throws his body overboard and later tells the family that he has left on an urgent business trip. Her main concern is that she can only inherit a part of the family fortune if if her husband is alive. The Halorans are a strange family, still grieving over the death of the youngest daughter Kathleen who drowned in a pond when she was just a child. They hold an annual ceremony of remembrance every year on the anniversary of her death. This year however, someone is wielding an ax intent on murder.</p>
<p>The seventh anniversary of the death of then pre-teen Kathleen Haloran is approaching, she who died from drowning in the pond on the family estate, Haloran Castle, in Ireland. Since, her mother, the family matriarch Lady Haloran, who still lives in Haloran Castle, has had a maniacal obsession with Kathleen's memory. She holds a memorial ceremony every year on the estate on that anniversary, the ceremony only reserved for those blood members of their immediate family, namely her and her three now adult sons, John Haloran, Richard Haloran and Billy Haloran. She works herself up into a frenzy more so around this time of the year because of the ceremony. And she has deeded her entire estate to a charity in Kathleen's name. None of these facts sit well with John's greedy wife, Louise Haloran, who believes her mother-in-law is crazy. Another soon to be addition to the family is Richard's fianc√©e, Kane. On the eve of the ceremony, John dies from a heart attack in front of Louise, who hides his death from the family as she tries to work her and John back into the will through an elaborate scheme involving Lady Haloran's obsession with Kathleen, and Louise acting the caring, concerned daughter-in-law. Coinciding with this anniversary is the disappearance of several people from the estate. What those remaining on the estate are unaware of is that the missing people have been hacked to death by an ax murderer. Lady Haloran's physician, Dr. Justin Caleb, takes it upon himself to find out the cause of all the strange goings-on on the estate if only for Lady Haloran's sake. If he or anybody finds out the truth, they will learn that these ax murders are connected to Kathleen's death seven years earlier.</p>
<p>John Haloran has a fatal heart attack, but his wife Louise won't get any of the inheritance when Lady Haloran dies if John is dead. Louise forges a letter from John to convince the rest of his family he's been called to New York on important business, and goes to his Irish ancestral home, Castle Haloran, to meet the family and look for a way to ensure a cut of the loot. Seven years earlier John's sister Kathleen was drowned in the pond, and the Halorans enact a morbid ritual in remembrance. Secrets shroud the sister's demise, and soon the family and guests begin experiencing an attrition problem.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When Alfred Hitchcock's Marion Crane (of "Psycho") stepped into the shower and met her fate, it kicked off a slew of stark, grisly chillers about nutcases, often wielding butcher knives or axes.  This entry has the distinction of being one of Coppola's earliest directorial efforts and it is clearly influenced by Hitchcock, though without his budget or seasoned mastery.  Anders plays a rather nagging wife who is visiting her husband's ancestral castle with him just in time to "celebrate" the anniversary of his kid sister's funeral.  He, his two brothers and his mother gather annually to pay tribute to the little girl who was drowned on the premises years before.  One brother (Campbell) is an angry sculptor with an American fiancee (Mitchel.)  The other (Patton) is a gentle, sort of shy type.  The mother (Dunne) can't get past the death of her daughter and faints on cue each year at the ceremony.  Not long into the film, one death sets off a chain of events that unleashes a couple of other ones to where no one at the castle is safe and the audience is often not certain who the mad killer is (though veteran fans of horror/suspense shouldn't have that much trouble figuring it out.)  The film is far from perfect, but given the unbelievable budgetary and filming restraints, it does manage to conjure up some creeps and story interest.  The only part that really drags is the section involving an overly inquisitive doctor (Magee.)  Otherwise, there is creativity in the filming of the deaths and a nice sense of atmosphere throughout (even if almost none of these Irish characters has anything resembling an accent!)  There are slicker fright films out there, but this one wins points for accomplishing pretty much with precious little to work with.</p>
