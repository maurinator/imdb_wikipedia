<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A young man becomes famous due to a horrific situation.  Now he has to live with the fame and the memories that it brings.  There seem to be too many characters, that are developed only to be left with without discussion after their scene.  Stephen Dorff does a great job, which is important, since the movie is mostly watching him walk around and deal with the stresses of his fame.  The flashbacks seem to do a good job of show his traumatic stress disorder.The sound track is great, with a special appearance by GWAR.See it or not.  As the main character says "So F**king What?"</p>
