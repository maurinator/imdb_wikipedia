<h1>Journey to the Sun (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mehmet, a young Turkish man newly migrated from the village Tire, takes a job searching for water leaks below the surface of the streets of Istanbul. Due to a strange set of events, he is mistaken for a Kurd, imprisoned, and brutally beaten. Upon his release a week later, he becomes an outcast marked as a Kurd, losing his apartment, his job, and eventually his girl friend, Arzu. When a Kurdish friend, Berzan is killed in a street protest triggered by a hunger strike, Mehmet takes a trek to return the body to Berzan's home village near the Iraqi border, and learns why so many Kurds are refugees.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a very good movie with a simple story but lyrical and poetic cinematography. The scenes both in the cities and the countryside are beautiful. Some Turkish commentators who disliked the movie are simply blinded by their extreme nationalism and unwillingness to admit that Kurds were -and still are- oppressed in Turkey. Do they deny that the Kurdish language was forbidden in Turkey until just a few years ago? They should just read Amnesty International's description of Turkey's justice system and mistreatment of prisoners. Of course, they also deny that their ancestors committed Genocide against the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire in 1915. If Turkey wants to join the EU, the young generation must first join twenty-first century and stop behaving like their ancestors. They must face history and come to terms with it. They must stop imprisoning journalists and others for "insulting Turkishness" simply by speaking out. It would also be nice if they stopped assassinating journalists and priests. Enjoy this very worthwhile movie, then read more about this region's history and make up your own mind.</p>
