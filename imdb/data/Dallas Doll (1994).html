<h1>Dallas Doll (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A feisty independent golf player wreaks havoc in a suburban Sydney home by attempting to seduce every member of the family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The film wouldn't be worth comment if it weren't for the utterly gorgeous, heart-melting Jake Blundell. Move over Sandra B! But Jake Blundell is not just eye-candy for the ladies! He has this magnetism, a studied intensity that carried the film, which is quite frankly a little lacking in plot. Future film stardom must be assured for this talented young buck.</p>
