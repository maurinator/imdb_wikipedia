Sylvia lives in her husband's professional shadow as she tries to eke out her own writing career, which doesn't come as naturally to her as it does to Ted. She also suspects him of chronic infidelity. Both issues affect Sylvia's already fragile emotional state, she who once tried to commit suicide earlier in her life.

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie and was really stunned. I am shocked that it has received such bad reviews because I think this is an amazing film. I understand Plath fans being upset that it does not go into detail with Sylvia's life, but this is a movie about the love of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes- Not the life of Sylvia Plath. It is a beautifully made movie. Paltrow does a phenomenal job of showing Sylvia's pain. She gives a great image of the torment Plath went through. The love story is both alluring and fascinating. Its so beautiful. I really cant say anything bad about this movie. I absolutely loved it, and it has not received the recognition it deserves.</p>
