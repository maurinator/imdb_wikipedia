<h1>The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>At the height of his fame (his plays being much celebrated in London in the 1890's), Oscar Wilde angers the Marquis of Queensberry by having what is whispered and gossiped as a romantic relationship with Queensberry's son, twenty years Wilde's junior. When Queensberry slanders Wilde, the arrogant artist decides to take the matter to court, and brings about his own downfall.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I can't find fault with one thing. My favourite film. I love Wilde, and this really just captured everything. I found this accurate, witty and touching. The court case in particular moved me, as did Finch's portrayal of the man himself. This is excellent and has stood the test of time.</p>
