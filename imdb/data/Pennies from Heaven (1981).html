<h1>Pennies from Heaven (1981)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Chicago during the 1930s depression, sheet music salesman Arthur Parker is trying to sell his products, but it's not easy to convince unwilling music store owners to buy them. Although he's already married to the somewhat drab Joan, when he meets school teacher Eileen in a music store, he falls in love with her.</p>
<p>Chicago, 1934. Dream sequences of the many characters in question lip-syncing and dancing to classic renditions of Tin Pan Alley songs propel the story of traveling sheet music salesman Arthur Parker. He is in a largely unsatisfying marriage to Joan Parker due to their incompatibility. Puritanical Joan sees sex as a dirty thing, which frustrates Arthur. What Joan primarily wants in a husband is a good provider, which Arthur isn't doing with this job, although he sees himself as the most knowledgeable about the music he is selling, especially as he really would like to live the lyrics to those happy songs. If he had the money, he'd open his own record store instead. On his travels, he spots shy junior school music teacher Eileen Everson, with who he falls in love at first sight. He sees her as the perfect woman, and although most of that vision of her is as an angel, he nonetheless wants to embark on a sexual relationship with her. As Arthur lies to her about his marital status, they do begin a relationship. Her reserved exterior masks her true wants as a red-blooded human. An outcome of their relationship forces Eileen to change her environment. And his encounter with a blind girl leads to an unexpected outcome. These items in combination may prevent that movie musical happy ending that Arthur in particular strives for in his life.</p>
<p>During the Great Depression, a sheet music salesman seeks to escape his dreary life through popular music and a love affair with an innocent school teacher.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am glad I don't live in Frostbite Falls because I might shiver at the thought of such a complex and clever film as PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. Made with a massive 1980 budget of $22 million and all of it up there on the screen, this genuine masterwork is one of the great unappreciated and misunderstood films of its day. The biggest hurdle the film could not overcome (then) was the casting of comedy stars in Art Deco darkness. Steve Martin had just scored a bullseye in the wild comedy THE JERK. For mainstream audiences to even then turn around and slightly embrace the sad loneliness of PENNIES' aching melancholy is impossible. PENNIES' failed and was consigned to misfire history. Today in 2005 this film deserves to stand with CHICAGO or even MOULIN ROUGE in its sly dark new century crowd pleaser theatrics. It is a film for this century and if audiences today have the chance to appreciate and applaud it's brilliant creative slant and dramatic spectacle, it will be a success. Possibly in the same ironic fantasy manner of THE PIRATE or YOLANDA AND THE THIEF, or LADY IN THE DARK of the 40s, ITS ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER from 1955, maybe THE BOYFRIEND of the 70s and even the original 1988 HAIRSPRAY by John Waters, PENNIES' belongs to that rare style of musical spectacle: the emotional fantasy with a dark satire core. Truly great.</p>
