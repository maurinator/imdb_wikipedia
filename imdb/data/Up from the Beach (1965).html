<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>That's the third feature released by Twentieth Century Fox - after D Day 6th of June and The Longest Day - about the "Landing Party" in Normandy.This feature is rather quite good, looking towards the future "Saving Private Ryan", nearly thirty years later...The tale of a group of US soldiers lead by an officer - Robertson - whose orders have been given to protect french countrymen, evacuate them from their devastated village to the beach, before send them to England, across the Channel. The odyssey through a dangerous and deadly country side filled up with German soldiers. This film gives a good study of characters. Red Buttons shows here an unusual performance, besides what he does in his others films. But all that doesn't prevent this movie not to be inventive, if you compare it with productions of this kind.A very good time waster, however</p>
