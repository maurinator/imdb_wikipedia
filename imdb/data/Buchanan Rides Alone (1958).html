<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Randolph Scott once claimed a certain club that refused membership to actors should let him since he had 50 movies to prove he wasn't an actor.He was being terribly modest.Watching "Buchanan Rides Alone" one realizes he was a very good actor.Critics say his best performances came with direction by Budd Boetticher and "Buchanan Rides Alone" stands as evidence for that belief.In fact, the entire cast gives great performances.One of the attractions of this film is that there are so many strong characters, so many individual parts very well played by great actors.Far too many of these great actors did not become famous, but they certainly deserved to.This is a classic.</p>
