<h1>The Longest Day (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It's nearing the end of the day. While the Marshalls are eating dinner, they hear all the animals making a ruckus outside. What they notice going outside is that the sun has not moved since the time they started preparing dinner, the implication being that time is standing still. As all three wear their pendants to keep in contact with each other, Rick goes in search of Enik who they believe may know what is happening. Monitoring the pendant, Will and Holly see that their father is in trouble, having been captured by the Sleestak. Rick learns from the Sleestak, who he can now understand, that they blame him for the sun's standstill by doing something to the pylon controlling the sun. Without the sun going down, they cannot continue their traditional hunting rituals. Rick has to convince them that he may be able to correct the situation by also convincing them that they may have been wrong in their beliefs for generations. Meanwhile, Will and Holly head to the Lost City to try and save their father.</p>
<p>When the sun stands still, the Sleestak wrongfully blame Rick for tampering with the pylon.</p>
