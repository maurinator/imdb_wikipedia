<p>This wonderful movie is set in the mid 1980's - three devoted friends work together in a Research Institute. They share everything /even their opera-glasses!/, they support each other and they know each other perfectly. Then suddenly everything starts to fall apart - a new director takes over the Institute and decides to develop close scientific partnership with similar institutes in Japan. And a rumor has it that one of our three friends might have a chance to go on a business mission there. But who? All the three friends take "secret steps" in order to get the "prize". Everything is at stake! Nothing is forbidden! Numerous sequences, full with humor, follow, and, at the very end, after the grotesque outcome, we can see the three friends together again.
