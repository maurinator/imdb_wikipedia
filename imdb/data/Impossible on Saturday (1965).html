<h1>Impossible on Saturday (1965)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Robert Hirsch joins the ranks of Jerry Lewis, Peter Sellers, and Alec Guinness in portraying multiple roles. This story is of a Jewish playboy's seven sons (played by Hirsch) who must meet in Israel to recite the memorial prayer for him, in order to receive their inheritance. The title comes from the non-observant son's (American) attempts to contact his family on the Sabbath, when work is impossible. There is sharp dialogue between the deceased and his own dead father (also portrayed by Hirsch. Must see, if you can find it.</p>
