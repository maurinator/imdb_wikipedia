<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Indian cinema has offered so many 'young love stories' like 'Bobby', 'Dil', 'Tezaab', 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye' etc. However, 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' remains my favorite of the lot. It is a somewhat dramatized but humble adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'. There have been numerous adaptations but what really makes this film work are the two leads and the music.I like how the character's were written. Raj isn't the typical macho hero or a romantic, he's just an ordinary young who joined his father's fabric business. Similarly, Laxmi isn't some damsel in distress or a clichéd spoilt brat rebelling against her parents. She's a strong minded young lady who's ready to sacrifice all for her love.Aamir Khan makes his entry to Indian cinema as leading man. He does nothing short of a brilliant job as the naive young Raj. The fact that he's a newcomer only adds to the character's childlike personality. Juhi Chawla already shows that she's here to stay. Not only is she naturally vivacious but she, in a wonderfully subtle way, displays Laxmi's innocence, childlikeness and determination. It's no surprise that since then Aamir and Juhi have been popular for their on screen chemistry. The supporting cast is adequate where Alok Nath stands out.Mansoor Khan's direction also deserves mention as he does not waste much time on unnecessary subplots. He stays mainly focused on the story of the two lovers. Only the beginning, where the conflict between the two families begins, appears a little too dramatic and clichéd. But once Raj is introduced, the film takes off towards a better direction. The background score is irritating most of the time.This was the time when great soundtracks were making a comeback in the commercial Hindi cinema considering that the 80s were infamous for poorest quality in cinema. The songs are soulful, melodious and memorable. After all, who doesn't know 'Papa Kehte Hain', 'Gazab Ka Hai Din' and 'Ae Mere Humsafar'? This is the album that made singer Udit Narayan an overnight star.To me, 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' is one of the most memorable tragic love stories on the Hindi cinema screen. What makes this film unique is the incredible chemistry between the two leads and their characterization. Simply great!</p>
