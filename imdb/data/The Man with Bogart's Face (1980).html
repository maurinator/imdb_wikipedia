<h1>The Man with Bogart's Face (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A man with a fixation on Humphrey Bogart gets plastic surgery to make him look exactly like Bogart. Then he changes his name to Sam Marlowe (after Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, two of Bogart's most famous characters), hires a ditzy blonde secretary, and opens up a detective agency. His first case is one that would do Bogie proud...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you like Bogart, you will enjoy this film thoroughly.  I only wish it was on video so I could buy it!  Very nostalgic.  Very Bogart...as he was in his Ace Private-Dick days as Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe.</p>
