<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Digger" is a hauntingly beautiful film, with subtle magic in it. The musical score is gorgeous, and the visuals will help you remember what a mysterious, exotic world our planet is. Joshua Jackson gives the best performance by a young actor in the 1990s, in his portrayal of Billy, a young mage who befriends the lonely title character (Adam Hann-Byrd).This is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. The only other film of its kind that has similar power is 1995's "The Cure".</p>
