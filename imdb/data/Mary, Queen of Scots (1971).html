<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is great! A classic! This is a MUST see if traveling to Scotland. It may take a few liberties with history, but the story line is intact and accurate. The film takes the viewer from Mary as a teenager in France, through her turbulent reign in Scotland, to her death in England. Mary is unapologetic for her faith or her actions, sorry only that she is imprisoned and prevented from seeing her son, who is a pivotal person in the evolution of Great Britian. Redgrave is wonderful and Jackson does her role very well, despite reviews to the contrary. The scenery is lush and the set depicting of the era. This movie needs to be release on DVD as soon as possible.It is VERY DIFFICULT to find on VHS ANYWHERE and is prohibitively expensive on e-bay.</p>
