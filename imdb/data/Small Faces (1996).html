<h1>Small Faces (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three teenage brothers, gang-member Bobby, troubled mama's boy Alan and self-assured prankster Lex, reside in a downtrodden section of Glasgow, Scotland, circa 1968. But while Bobby and Alan are beginning to experience the power of raging hormones, the story focuses on Lex, who begins a downward spiral after he accidentally shoots the leader of Bobby's gang. Lex's cockiness and immaturity unfortunately prevent him from understanding the effect his subsequent crimes will have on both himself, and on those around him.</p>
<p>Glasgow, 1968. Thirteen-year-old Lex Maclean lives with his mother, and his two older brothers, Alan, who plans to go to art school, and Bobby, a rather slow-witted member of the Glen gang. Lex enjoys art, but is caught up with the gangs when he mischievously fires an air gun at Malky Johnson, the gang leader of the Tongs. Charlie Sloan, the Glen gang leader, offers Lex protection if Lex will work with his gang. Malky is further annoyed with the Maclean brothers when his girlfriend Joanne is attracted to Alan.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Small Faces stands out as an unsentimental and unpatronising glimpse of the life of 1960s working class youth in Glasgow. The film is directed with a light touch and brilliantly conveys the experience of growing up in the slums with the stereotypical escape-routes of gangs, drink and education. In refusing to romanticise its subject matter the film is bleak, funny, brutal and life-affirming all at the same time.</p>
