<h1>Rockula (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rockula is about a male vampire who lost his lady love centuries ago. She was killed by a pirate with a rhinestone peg leg, wielding a large ham bone. Our hero, the vampire, did nothing to save her. So he is now cursed to watch her be born again in another life, and then watch her die, strangely enough by a pirate with a rhinestone peg leg, wielding you-know-what. Now, in 1990, he has, he suspects, his last chance to try to save her instead of watching get clubbed over and over again down through the years. Oh, and he becomes a rock star in the process.</p>
<p>A young vampire cannot lose his virginity because of a curse imposed upon him centuries ago.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is the only "musical" where all the songs are sung in contexts where they wouldn't seem weird in real life.  They all take place as background music or performances in videos and concerts.  None of that "the whole world has the same choreographer" crap from other musicals.  Sure, the wanna be rockstar version of dracula who is a bit of a departure from reality, but I think that's allowed in a vampire story :).  A pretty entertaining love story with a good soundtrack (I'm comparing it to B-movie standards here :).  Add all of this with seeing Toni Basil, Bo Didley and Thomas Dolby perform, and I think this movie is worth catching.  Good cheesy fun for all!!!</p>
