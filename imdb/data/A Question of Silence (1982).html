<h1>A Question of Silence (1982)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three women, all strangers to each other, meet in a dress boutique. One of the three is approached by the male proprietor as she is shoplifting a garment. When he approaches her the other two join her in beating the man to death. Other female shoppers ignore the whole situation and leave when the crime is complete. The court appoints a female psychriatrist to examine the women; contrary to public opinion the psychiatrist finds they are not insane but implies the rage expressed by the crime is a result of the male dominated society. An interesting study of extreme behavior. The prisoner's cells were a revelation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Very powerful and thoughtful.  Much superior to Gorris' more-acclaimed Antonia's Line, in my opinion.  This film has none of the cutesiness of Antonia but all of the thoughtfulness and thematic weight.  The theme is a subtle examination of the roles of men and women in Dutch society, and I guess it could apply to many societies.  The film has a viewpoint, but it problematizes and complicates matters so that it's impossible for the viewer to blindly accept that viewpoint.  It examines SUBTLE discrimination and dehumanization.The only frustration I had was the fact that the copy I viewed did not give subtitles to a lot of the dialogue--e.g., a woman listens to the radio for about a minute, but non-Dutch speakers (like myself) don't understand any of it, and I'm guessing that with a filmmaker as careful as Gorris, this dialogue is important.</p>
