<h1>La Bohème (1988)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Extremely edifying, awe-inspiring, and passionate cinematic interpretation of Puccini's opera about a tragic love between the good natured and friendly poet Rodolfo (played by Luca Canonici, and sung by Jose Carreras) and the lonely, consumptive flower girl Mimi (Barbara Hendricks) in the heart of Paris in the late 1800's. Ardent, soulful singing, robust yet sublime performances, seamless production design, exquisite cinematography, and an overall, unparalled sense of craft make this one a winner. Even people who are not fans of opera are bound to be moved.</p>
