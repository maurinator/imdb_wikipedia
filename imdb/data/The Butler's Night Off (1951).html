<h1>The Butler's Night Off (1951)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The 20 year old Canadian made his screen debut in this forgotten project titled 'The Butler's Night Off'. There's no shades of genius in it, nor does it contain any entertainment value. It did, however, provide a vehicle for Shatner's career.</p>
