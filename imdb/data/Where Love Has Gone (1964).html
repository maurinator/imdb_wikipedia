<h1>Where Love Has Gone (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After his teenage daughter Danny is arrested for the murder of his ex-wife's current lover, Luke Miller recalls his marriage to Valerie Hayden and the subsequent events which led to the tragedy. The lurid story seems to have been suggested by the real-life Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato/Cheryl Crane murder scandal of six years earlier when Lana's daughter Cheryl stabbed her mother's boyfriend (Stompanato) to death in the bedroom of Lana's Beverly Hills home.</p>
<p>A divorced couple's teen-age daughter stands trial for stabbing her mother's latest lover.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie begins with a murder, but the real crime is that this piece isn't on DVD.While this story is said to be based on the Turner/daughter/lover murder the real punch of THIS story develops out the relationship of the Danielle (Heatherton) character's parents; two people from totally opposite worlds brought together by the drama of war, and sudden celebrity.Each is ambitious, headstrong and in fact in love.However their fairy tale includes a powerful matriarch, played by Bette Davis, her performance is stunning; her character so evil and ultimately unpunished for the pain she brings to the lives of everyone in this story.Their daughter loses most when their relationship is destroyed, "I want to be ten years old and have a mother and father." This movie is her story.People who criticized the production values, 15 years pass where no one ages note the vehicles used from the war are old, the present includes cars from the early 60's. Frankly I was left thinking hmm what a genteel time when a teen in trouble was only 'sexually active', today she'd have to be portrayed as a crack whore! The story builds to a final confrontation wherein Luke (Connors) takes an approach many fans of the Mannix series will recognize. The revelations of the night of the murder surprised me, with Valerie (Hayward) character tapping inner strength to face down her mother, and paying the ultimate price.I watched this at the egging' of a friend, in the end I couldn't wait for the finale, screaming and shouting at the TV like the 4th quarter of the Superbowl.The rich are just like you and me, except they have the money to hide their troubles. 8/10</p>
