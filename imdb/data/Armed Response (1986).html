<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an underrated solid action flick of the 80's from Lee Van Cleef and David Carradine, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Armed Response (1986) is a good solid action film of the 80's , It has flaws but I still like it. I love action and horror movies from the 80's and Armed Response (1986) Is one of them. I am an Lee Van Cleef fan and for a Lee Van Cleef fan and his character is definitely my favorite film that I like. For a Few Dollars More (1965) and Escape from New York (1981) are two my favorite films from Lee Van Cleef, I seriously like his two characters in those two films: Col. Douglas Mortimer and Bob Hauk New York Police Commissioner are two of Lee Van Cleef's characters I like, but now I love his character Burt Roth retired police officer, the father of his three sons. I like this action film, for a cheaper action film it was really decent it had nice shoot outs and a nice car explosion and the twist around. I love the Music theme by Thomas Chase and Steve Rucker. Almost everyone who was involved in making this movie is dead now. David Carradine, Lee Van Cleef, Mako, Lois Hamilton all past away are no longer with us anymore.Plot: One of Tanaka's underlings has stolen a rare statuette that he had planned to use as a peace offering between the local Yakusa and Chinese Tong. He hires two private investigators to exchange ransom money to recover the statuette, but the trade goes down bad and Clay Roth is killed. This angers Roth's brothers and father, all combat veterans, and they go after the people responsible.Jim Roth (Carradine) is a Vietnam veteran, family man, and owner of a bar. His father Burt (Van Cleef) hangs out there, as do other brothers Tommy (Huff) and Clay (Goss). It's a close family, as Jim's wife Sara (Hamilton) and young daughter Lauren (Chodan) also stop by on occasion. But the Roth family is about to encounter some trouble in the form of Yakuza boss Akira Tanaka (Mako), who desperately wants a valuable statue and will stop at nothing to get it, mainly because he will use it as a bargaining chip to prevent a Chinatown mob war with the Tongs.When Clay stupidly gets involved with Tanaka (and his evil bodyguard F.C. (Berryman), it sets off a chain of events where various members of the Roth family get in trouble - and Jim, who suffers from Vietnam flashbacks and nightmares, must team up with his father, Burt, to go back into an American-Asian war by gearing up to blow away the Yakuza. Add into this mix the slimy Cory Thorton (Hagen), as well as other various and sundry unsavory characters, and there's going to have to be an ARMED RESPONSE! The acting performance from this movie is solid, the script is terrible but the action in here is pretty good. This movie is more about a betrayal, stolen statue, family and a theft of a half of million dollars. Laurene Landon is also as extra in here as a thief in this movie, she has only two scenes, she was also cast in Maniac Cop 1 and 2. I seriously love movies from the 80's, they are part of my life and the two main heroes in this movie are decent. David Carradine is the main hero and his father Lee Van Cleef is the hero who does everything that keeps his only son alive. This film isn't about revenge and honestly I think Jim Roth (David Carradine) is well written character, honest, loyal and decent. He is not selfish he returns the statue to Tanaka (Mako) and he didn't want to killed him, even tough Tanaka was responsible for his two brothers death.The shootings and the action scenes were great I like it, the automatic weapons are a lot and they are used well. You have one car explosion. You also have Michael Berryman in it as another villain from Wes Craven's classic horror films The Hills Have Eyes 1 & 2, you also have a flashbacks on a Vietnam war when Jim is having another nightmare on his past life as a Vietnam Vet soldier, what he had to do, to surviving the war. He even has a wife and a young daughter. I also like the fighting sequence when Jim is fighting off a few drug dealers, while he is searching for Cory Thorton. I like that Lee Van Cleef kills 2 bad guys. One in a bar when he was holding Jim as hostage and one in a shoot out, while he was helping his son Jim saving his wife and his daughter. Burt shoot the bad guy and killed him, the baddie fall in an electric wire and was electrocuted. Overral: This action flick is forgotten and is not bad for cheaper film, it could have been a better action film but because of the money they couldn't make such a big action film that would get a higher rating or would be famous. This movie get's an 8 by me mainly for Lee Van Leef and David Carradine awesome action performances.Armed Response is a 1986 action crime film, starring David Carradine and Lee Van Cleef and directed by Fred Olen Ray.
