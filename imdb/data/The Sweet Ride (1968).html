Motorcycle gang leader is in turn beaten up by Franciosa and Sarrazin. Main characters all grow up a bit. Music by Dusty Springfield and Moby Grape.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On the beach, three single guys and Jackie Bissett in her 20's - what more could you hope for. Tony Franciosa (good actor) plays aging tennis bum who skirt-chases, Bob Denver as the nebbish who's not dumb, and Michael Sarrazin (who was Ms. Bisset's real-life love interest back then) and the stunning Jackie in her beauty prime. Watching this flick is like hanging out with friends you like for the weekend that make you want to go home after a while. Furtive glances abound. There's definitely not enough women in this plot. A 6 out of 10. Best performance = Tony Franciosa. He works the room in the most shallow 60's way (like Tony Curtis did), but you like the guy because he never gives up. A fun flick with great locale!</p>
