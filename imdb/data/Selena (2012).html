<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On March 31, 1995, singer-songwriter Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was gunned down in a Texas motel. She was not quite 24 years old. Her killer was Yolanda Saldívar who had run the Selena fan club and business enterprise. Saldivar had ripped off her employer and friend for around $30,000. Instead of calling in the police, Selena and her father had simply fired her. After arranging a meeting with Selena, Saldivar appears to have lost it and shot her. That was the version the jury accepted anyway.This documentary includes reconstructions, archive footage and interviews with among other's Selena's husband.</p>
