<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Elizabeth is a popular thirteen year old who can't wait for the day the Queen of England visits her quaint New Zealand hometown. Her excitement becomes almost too much to bear upon learning that she might get to meet the Queen face to face! But as the rest of the town busies itself in eager anticipation of the big day, Elizabeth finds herself drawn to the elderly and mysterious outcast Hira.</p>
<p>Synopsis: As a small New Zealand town prepares for a once-in-a-lifetime royal visit, a young girl (Sally Andrews), who dreams of meeting The Queen, finds her fervent hopes put in jeopardy when she develops an unlikely, life-changing friendship with an elderly Maori woman (Vicky Haughton, Whale Rider) outcast from society.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The writer and director have provided a wholesome and entertaining movie which should be appreciated by the whole family.  It encompasses history involving the peoples of New Zealand and England.  It is a lovely story concerning trips taken by English Royalty to New Zealand and shows how a gift of appreciation is misused and how this misuse is finally rectified. The cast does a fine job of portraying the characters involved and the movie leaves you with an overall pleasant  feeling of enjoyment.</p>
