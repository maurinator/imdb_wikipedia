<h1>Loyalties (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lily and her three youngest children join her husband David Sutton, a doctor in an isolated northern Alberta town. Their eleven-year-old son arrives later from boarding school. David conceals a dark secret which caused the family to leave England without telling anybody. They befriend a neighbor Rosanne, who throws out her boyfriend after he beats her up in a bar. Lily, who is very English and out of place in the town, hires the half-Native Rosanne as a housekeeper, and eventually the two women become good friends, until the secret emerges again.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film 17 years ago, when it first came out, at the Toronto Film Festival, and yet many parts of it are as clearly etched in my mind as if I had seen it yesterday. It deals with a very contentious issue in a sensitive manner, building with a slow and understated momentum to a harrowing climax. Tantoo Cardinal's performance in particular is exceptional. Highly recommended.</p>
