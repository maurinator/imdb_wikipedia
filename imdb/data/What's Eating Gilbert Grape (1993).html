<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first time I saw this film, I had yet to know the name Leonardo DiCaprio. And I was stunned. Is that actor really retarded or what? His acting is so excellent, you don't need to doubt why he got to be so big.But all others perform real well also. I have always had an eye for Depp's acting, and Lewis is, like always, little. The new thing is that she's kind and caring.This is a great film, and if nothing else, watch it because a swede directed it.</p>
