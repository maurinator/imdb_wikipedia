<h1>Ashes to Ashes (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Writer: The Story revolves around Gabriel Darbeaux, a young screenwriter and martial arts enthusiast who supplements his income by escorting wealthy women. Gabriel's latest screenplay is a thriller entitled 'Ashes to Ashes'. The Girl: When a chance encounter brings the beautiful and mysterious Arabella Simone into his life, Gabriel finds that the dangerous world of the Italian Mafia and Chinese Triads, featured in his screenplay, is now his reality. The Tarantula: For Sicilian Valentino Tarontola, there is only one thing worse than stealing his money; stealing his mistress. When Gabriel is suspected of both, the 'Tarantula' sends his most trusted associates to seek him out. The Laundrymen: Dirty men for dirty work. Afro-British Muhammed Armen and Triad Enforcer Nelson Kong lead the cast of villains. Cool and sadistic, Muhammed enjoys burning his victims whereas Nelson favours the 18 weapons of Shaolin. Together with Nelson's brother Raymond, his cousin Ming and the Jamaican Leo they form the infamous five. The Gigolo: Caught up in the confusion is Michael Trent, Gabriel's reluctant best friend. Michael enjoys the intimate company of women (for a substantial fee) and is as fond of himself as Gabriel is fond of martial arts. The Banker's Wife: Felicity Wood is Michael's favourite customer. Unfortunately her husband Richard is Valentino Tarontola's 'personal banker'.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you want to get bored and disappointed with the movie industry then see this movie.Ashes to Ashes is trying to be a kung-fu/mafia/action/sex movie which doesn't really work within any of these genres. The dialogue is truly awful, embarrassing and is obviously trying to emulate Tarantino's style - but I think Quentin can rest easy in Hollywood! The acting is at best desperate and at worst laughable. However there is some acting talent within the cast unfortunately it is very well hidden beneath lousy direction and a clich√©d script.I hate to be so negative about a movie especially when I am so into independent films and have the ultimate respect for all film makers out there however this is a first class example of what complete and utter garbage can be created by someone with (I presume) too much time on his hands but not enough money or talent. I'm saying this because apparently this movie was written, directed, produced and starred by the same person.Well If you would like to waste your time, money and sanity... then try to buy it and... well try (if you can) to watch it.I just hope Wayne Trotman has got this movie making business out of his system and I pray that there is not a sequel in production.</p>
