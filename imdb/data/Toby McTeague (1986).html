<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An excellent movie for boys (or girls) and their Fathers to see together. Filmed in Sainte Rose du Nord, Quebec. I saw it again recently, for reasons of nostalgia, for the first time since I was a boy. (I grew up in a similar community in Quebec - Sainte Catherine de Hatley - and it made quite a powerful impression then.) I was deeply pleased, however, to find it just as thrilling and enjoyable through adult eyes! Good old fashioned courage, honor, respect for elders and the great outdoors, a little romantic crush, and even a dose of life-lesson sadness are the general themes of the piece, and they are delivered without contrivance through an exciting and often humorous plot. The film moves at a distinctly human pace, and this too I found refreshing. In an age of mile-a-minute roller coaster family movies, Toby McTeague delivers a blast of fresh, cool air.</p>
