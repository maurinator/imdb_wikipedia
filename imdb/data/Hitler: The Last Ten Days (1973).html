<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Hitler: The Last Ten Days" is watchable chiefly due to the remarkable portrayal of the Nazi dictator by Alec Guinness.  Guinness sought to portray Hitler as a man and succeeds in his efforts.The opening credits, narrated by Alstair Cooke are noteworthy in giving a 5 minute history lesson bringing the viewer up to date - April 20, 1945 in the Berlin bunker of Adolph Hitler.  The acts of Hitler in the final 10 days of his life, bizarre and murderous to the end, are worth watching only because of Guinness.  He has the mannerisms and although I've never met Hitler, after watching this film, I felt that I had.  The physical resemblance is startling.Most frightening scene:  Hitler's worst tantrum ever after finding out he had been "betrayed" by his generals.  Alec Guinness goes from hysterical rage to sobbing "the war is lost" and makes you feel the terror his underlings must have felt.</p>
