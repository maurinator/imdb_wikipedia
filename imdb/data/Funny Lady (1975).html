<h1>Funny Lady (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The continuing story of Fanny Brice following that depicted in Funny Girl (1968) is presented. An established star on Broadway as a headliner for the Ziegfeld Follies, Fanny and the rest of the world are hitting difficult times entering into the 1930s. Her marriage to Nicky Arnstein, who she still loves is ending in divorce, and even Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. is having trouble coming up with money to continue to produce the Follies. Along comes brash nightclub owner, song lyricist and wannabe impresario Billy Rose, who says he can raise the money and has the material to produce his own revue, which he wants to star Fanny. Fanny is both attracted to and repelled by Billy because of his chutzpah, his stubbornness and knowing that underneath his outer veneer is the soul of a true hustler... much like she was when she was first starting out and much like she still is now. Through their professional trials and tribulations, they slowly start to fall for each other. But Fanny admits that Nicky is still never far from her mind...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Funny Lady", a continuation of the life of singer-comedienne Fanny Brice begun in 1968 with "Funny Girl", is a smashing good time: a musical-comedy with exuberance, raucous wit, sentiment and bittersweet romance. Barbra Streisand is back as Fanny, involved romantically with sparring-partner/producer Billy Rose (James Caan), but still carrying a torch for ex-husband Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif returning, this time with a sinister sheen). At one point, realizing Arnstein has no heart to give her, Fanny walks down a hotel corridor singing, "I'll be damned, I have been damned, but I won't be damned anymore!" This is a great moment for "Funny Girl" fans, to see Fanny come full circle in her feelings for this man whom she held up on a pedestal. James Caan peddles his scenes a little softly--almost sheepishly--and once the two leads get married, the narrative becomes squashed and the heartbreak feels forced. The screenplay is factually inaccurate (to put it mildly), but Streisand is in high-gear nearly throughout; meddlesome, bitchy, soft and sexy, a smart-ass, she's the reason people went to see "Funny Lady" in 1975 and she's still a great reason to go the movies. ***1/2 from ****</p>
