<h1>Tight Spot (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sherry Conley, a street tough and cynical woman with an unhappy family background, is taken from prison to a hotel, where the DA tries to convince her to testify against a mobster. Sherry is reluctant because the last witness was murdered before he made it to the stand, and why should she stick her neck out? At the hotel, several attempts are made on her life, and she falls for Vince, the policemen guarding her.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>From the play "Dead Pigeon" comes this overwrought confection with Ginger Rogers chewing the scenery as wisecracking jailbird sprung from the pokey by police so she can testify against ruthless mobster at a high-profile murder trial. Talky, slightly claustrophobic piece really needs Ginger's overacting to kick it into gear; she looks great in a short, ducktail bob, and manages to create real sparks with the actress portraying her selfish sister (it's the best scene in the movie). Brian Keith is appealing in his modest, aw-shucks way as troubled cop Vince Striker (great character name); Katherine Anderson also fine as a prison matron. So-so film benefits from star-appeal. **1/2 from ****</p>
