<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>KTLA, in Los Angeles, used to excavate this moldy bit of time-travel weirdness, fairly often. I got interested from the cast, uniting Jeffrey Hunter, (at about the same time he would have been filming the original "Star Trek" pilot, "The Cage"), with future "Star Trek" guest, France Nuyen, ("Elaan Of Troyas"). The SF is very low-budget, very typical of its time, but still manages some interesting comments on time-travel, and its ramifications. (similar in some ways to a classic bit of SF, also pretty forgotten nowadays, "Cyborg 2087"). The time-travel belt is astoundingly cheap, yet every kid I knew wanted one! (ah, the old days before marketing took over!) Hunter gives this more than it probably deserved, and his performance brings most of the worth to the proceedings, while Nuyen tries to look Chinese, (and Communist!). The production was obviously quite cheap, and I have my doubts this ever played theatres. Saw it for years on Independent TV stations around the country, but it's pretty rare anymore. Skiffy ran it once or twice (I think), back when they survived on old movies, and never since they got "respectable", yet it's really no worse than much of their low-budget offerings. It's good cheese, and I wish it would poke its head out now and then.</p>
