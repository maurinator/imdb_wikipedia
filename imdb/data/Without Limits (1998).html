<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fascinating and unique story of the legendary American distance Steve Prefontaine, who is portrayed here by Billy Crudup.  To be honest here, I haven't seen the other film that was based on Pre's life ("Prefontaine").  This film places the majority of its' attention solely on the relationship between Pre (Crudup) and his coach in college and the Olympics, Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).  Like Crudup, Sutherland is near perfect here and should rank as one of his best performances.  The monologue that Sutherland gives after showing television news footage of the infamous massacre that tarnished the Summer games in Munich is just...flawless.  Monica Potter is fine here as the girl who Prefontaine had the most interest in.  Look for director William Friedkin appears early in the movie in a small role.  The film's director/co-writer, Robert Towne is wise in how to handle the drama and tension here and shows what a genius he is.  Now that I look back at the film, I wonder if there'll be another great distance runner to come from the U.S..  The answer might come in Alan Webb?  I don't know.</p>
