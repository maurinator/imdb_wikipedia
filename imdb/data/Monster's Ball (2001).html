<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What are you repulsed by?  Perhaps it's having sex with women of African origin inspite of the fact that you are a White male raised in a racist culture that dehmanises them. Add to this predicament, that you are a retired, widowed prison corrections officer who's only son kills himself because he feels he's failed you because he is not racist enough.  Even worse, you become enligthtened enough to realise that  .. you were ALWAYS wrong.This is a brilliant story told from the rather selfish perspective of the White male.  Mark Forster has directed a tour de force so intricate and psychologically honest that the story literally TELLS itself.  Indeed, I'd bet this story organically spewed from souls of screenwirters Milo Addica & Will Rokos. They won't top this fete anytime soon.  Such a gateway of insight only comes around once in a lifetime.As a huge fan of David Mamet and Sam Shepard I am biased to appreciate a well balanced story, illustrated with terse dialogue, structured acting and effective filmic devices (i.e., the use of "white" paint", "black" coffee and "chocolate" ice cream in the film).Any film student will also appreciate the poetic use of foreshadowing and irony in this film.  This truly is SOLID filmaking that takes real chances with provocative subject matter.The acting is superb more because of  the Direction.  To be certain: this is a Director's Film.  Every aspect of Thorton's and Berry's performances is the result of very savvy Direction and attention to dramatic detail.Kudos to Mr. Forster.  I look forward his upcoming film "Neverland" with great anticipation.</p>
