<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This superb,little known WW2 comedy starring Peter Marshall(Hollywood Squares)as a MasterSargeant and Tommy Noonan as himself who plays a recruit as they both get stranded on a deserted island with a strikingly beautiful model and are comparatively safe until they discover that 2 stranded Japanese soldiers(Also played by Marshall and Noonan)are also on the same island.This fine comedy is unfortunately not on vhs/dvd yet,unless lucky enough to catch it on television.</p>
