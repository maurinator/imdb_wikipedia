<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is the story of Carrie White, a lonely and painfully shy teenage girl with unbelievable telekinetic powers, and is slowly being pushed to the edge of insanity by frequent bullying from both cruel classmates at her school, and her own domineering, religious mother. One classmate, Sue Snell, feels sorry for Carrie and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. But another classmate, Chris Hargenson, is banned from the prom and is determined with her boyfriend to have her revenge on Carrie. Carrie soon discovers she has telekinetic powers; and when the most gruesome prank is played on her on prom night, anything can happen.</p>
<p>Carrie White is a shy, troubled teenage girl with the unwanted and often uncontrollable gift of telekinesis, the ability to move any objects by mere thought. This can be triggered at any time by Carrie's heightened emotional state of anger or fear. Carrie is frequently harassed at her high school by wealthy and snobbish classmates and even more at home by her demented, Christian-fundamentalist fanatic mother, Margaret. One classmate, Sue Snell, feels compassion for Carrie and gets her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to asks Carrie to the senior prom. But another classmate, Chris Hargenson, is banned from the prom and plots a cruel prank against Carrie at the prom involving a bucket of pig's blood which pushes the unstable Carrie completely over the edge and uses her telekinetic powers to turn the prom into her own bloodbath.</p>
<p>Based on the Stephen King novel, this is a made-for-TV remake of the 1976 classic horror flick about an abused, mousy girl with telekinetic powers. Carrie White, whose unique powers are showcased early on, is an introspective teenager whose domineering, religious mother, Margaret, raises her in an almost hateful manner. Life is worse at school: Her cruel classmates constantly tease her at every turn. Things escalate when Carrie freaks out in gym class when she has her first period, resulting in her classmates pulling an action that crosses the lines of heinousness. Carrie's teachers stick up for her, banning instigator Chris Hargenson from the school prom. One of the involved girls feels guilty for her actions by setting her boyfriend up as Carrie's prom date. But Chris raises the stakes by hatching a plot with her boyfriend to humiliate Carrie at the prom. Everything goes according to plan... that is, except for Carrie's reaction. And it's a reaction that has everyone regretting that they ever wrongly passed Carrie's path.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This version of Carrie was not totally horrible, but I wasen't totally impressed either.  The worst part of the movie I thought was that it was very predictable.  I understand that this movie is from a classic Steven King novel, but it was horror so I was hopeing to get atleast something out of it.  Plus, most of the effects we're computerized.  Like 90% of it, and you could tell.  Living in an age of computers it was very dull.  I also remember finishing the movie and going, thats it?  I found the actress playing Carrie to be descent, as well as her teacher, but other then that, if you missed it when it came on tv, you didn't miss much.</p>
