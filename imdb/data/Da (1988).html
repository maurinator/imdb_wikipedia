<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am not a fan of Martin Sheen by any stretch of the imagination. I will move on to another channel by instinct if he happens to appear on the screen. However, I remember seeing this on TV many years ago and never seeing it again. It must have been one of his best performances. This came out shortly after my father passed away, and I was mesmerized by the mental conflicts that were haunting Charlie as he attempted to come to terms with the death of his father. The mix of humor and mental anguish brought me up and then plummeted me to the ground throughout the film. It was much like a roller-coaster ride, cautious at one moment at what might come next, but yet anxious to see what it might be. I would like to see the film again, Martin Sheen's performance was outstanding.</p>
