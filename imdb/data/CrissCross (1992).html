<h1>CrissCross (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in 1969, a twelve-year-old grows up in Key West with his mother, who is paying the bills by stripping at the local topless bar. The boy finds out about her activities and tries to convince her to stop, to no avail. A local restaurant owner hires him to collect fish from a boat out in the bay, and the boy discovers that the restaurant owner is using the fish to bring drugs in to shore. He steals one load and goes about selling it so his mother can afford to quit her job.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Slow paced as mentioned in another comment like a sleepy summer afternoon, the depiction of life in Key West in the late 60's rings true. It isn't polished and glitzy or glamorous. You can see this play out in your life or the life of friends.the film centers around young David Arnott in the title role. The awkwardness and naturalism works in making it more real.If you are looking for whizbang Hollywood value type of action here, this isn't the place. what you get is a true to life drama that can happen anywhere, at any place. David's moral choices are based on how he sees things as a real kid.As a movie, it works well.</p>
