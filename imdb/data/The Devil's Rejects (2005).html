<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Wow! Rob Zombie's "The Devil's Rejects" turns up the violence a notch in this sequel to his earlier entry into the horror genre, "House of 1000 Corpses". In this hard-hitting movie, we pick up the tale of the extremely warped central characters a few months after the events of the original tale. The film moves at a great pace and reminded me of a Tarantino project - convincing performances from some familiar genre favourites (including Ken Foree from Romero's "Dawn of the Dead"), sparkling dialogue and loads of over-the-top, uncompromising violence.The visuals and soundtrack to "The Devil's Rejects" are jaw-droppingly impressive. This film looks like a labour of love. It's a real treasure chest of delights for horror fans and a film that demands a second viewing.One last thing, just make sure you watch the full-strength, unrated version for maximum effect.</p>
