<h1>Godspell (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A modern-day version of the gospels, opening with John the Baptist calling a disparate group of young New Yorkers from their workaday lives to follow and learn from Jesus. They form a roving acting troupe that enacts the parables through song and dance, comedy, and mime. Jesus' ministry ends with a last supper, his Crucifixion in a junkyard, and, the following morning, his body being carried aloft by his apostles back into the world of the living on the streets of New York.</p>
<p>An adaption of the musical, in a modern-day song-and-dance recreation of the Gospel of St. Matthew.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>even though it was really hard to get on DVD we finally did and i was just blown away it is so good!!!!!by my side is the best and prettiest song i love it...the movie rocks and i want all strict religious people to watch this and see the real meaning of religion!!!!they portrait religion as such a violet thing to us with all the damnation and hells and literally scare us with that which does not accomplish anything...yet there is a musical like god spell which is so light and loving that shows us the great side of Jesus and how he himself was human and we could be like that instead of some Saviour no one ever can be like...i think schools should show this movie to all kids...i love this movie and i hope everyone reading this will watch it..its so worth it..and the actors and actresses are really talented...</p>
