<h1>Incognito (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Well, not technically sound all the way through, but for 2am on HBO, this is quite a good little movie.  Patric seems a little lost, and the whole thing with his father isn't done very well, but Jacob is always nice to watch, and there were enough interesting parts and nice shots, to keep one's attention. In any event, watching those paintings was pretty cool.  Pretty good. All in all, a rather pleasant movie.</p>
