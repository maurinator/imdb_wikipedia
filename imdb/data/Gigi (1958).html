<h1>Gigi (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Weary of the conventions of Parisian society, a rich playboy and a youthful courtesan-in-training enjoy a platonic friendship, but it may not stay platonic for long. Gaston, the scion of a wealthy Parisian family finds emotional refuge from the superficial lifestyle of upper class Parisian 1900s society with the former mistress of his uncle and her outgoing, tomboy granddaughter, Gigi. When Gaston becomes aware that Gigi has matured into a woman, her grandmother and aunt, who have educated Gigi to be a wealthy man's mistress, urge the pair to act out their roles but love adds a surprise twist to this delightful turn-of-the 20th century Cinderella story.</p>
<p>Gigi, living in the Belle Ã‰poque era of Paris, is training to be a courtesan- a highly educated and cultured woman who will become a society darling and mistress to wealthy men. She is mentored by her kind but firm Grandmother who has raised her and her glamorous, flamboyant Aunt Alicia. Both try to teach her the ways of good manners, first class diamonds and rolling cigars however the vivacious and idealistic tomboy is resistant. Her respite from her lessons comes in the form of her good friend Gaston - a wealthy aristocrat and playboy who is bored by the decadent but superficial world he inhabits. The two have a dear playful friendship. However with Gigi growing up and Gaston's current mistress being caught up in scandal can these two escape the inevitable roles their two worlds seemed determine to place on them and perhaps explore the true feelings that lie beneath their friendship? All this takes place under the eye of Honore Lachaille (played by the legendary Maurice Chevalier) Gaston's charming, cheery and youthful Uncle who doubles as the movie's narrator and Gaston's mentor in the story. Comedy, romance and many a delightful song ensue.</p>
<p>Gaston is a restless Parisian playboy who moves from one mistress to another, while also spending time with Gigi, a precocious younger friend learning the ways of high society. The platonic relationship between Gaston and Gigi changes, however, when she matures, but the possibility of something lasting seems unlikely since he won't commit to one woman. Gigi refuses to be anyone's mistress, however, and Gaston must choose between her and his carefree lifestyle.</p>
<p>Weary of the conventions of Parisian society, a rich playboy and a youthful courtesan-in-training enjoy a platonic friendship, but it may not stay platonic for long.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Although MGM and other studios would continue in the genre for several more years, GIGI is the last great musical of Hollywood's golden age. It is also one of the few titles consistently mentioned when critics dispute which film should be considered the single finest musical ever created by Hollywood, a film that rivals the likes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS.Based on a novella by Colette, GIGI tells the story of a French family of the belle epoch--a family, it seems, of women who have made their living from the favors of famous men. Still something of a gawky schoolgirl, Gigi (Leslie Caron) is being trained to become a courtesan, and when she suddenly blossoms she captures the heart of Paris sophisticate Gaston Lachaille (Louis Jourdan.) But much to her family's horror, when the arrangements are completed Gigi suddenly declines! The cast is absolutely flawless. Caron was born to play Gigi, and is as charming as the awkward youth as she is as the suddenly beautiful young woman; Jordan's appeal as the worldly and world weary Gaston is tremendous. But the real joy of the cast is in its supporting cast, which includes Maurice Chevalier as Gaston's uncle; Hermione Gingold and Isabel Jeans as Gigi's grandmother and great aunt; and Eva Gabor as Gaston's current mistress. Chevalier and Gingold play their roles with precisely the right mixture of charm and severity, and their duet "I Remember It Well" is among the highlights of the film, while Jeans and Gabor give such great comic turns that their small roles become as memorable as the leads.The Learner & Lowe score is equal their great Broadway success MY FAIR LADY, and offers such enjoyable and memorable songs as "Gigi" and "The Night They Invented Champagne;" the script equals and merges with the music to considerable effect. Filmed largely on location in Paris, the look of the film is incredibly rich, and director Vincent Minnelli maintains a sprightly sense of humor with just enough darkness behind the bubbles to make us aware of the seriousness of the tale. Mixing intimacy with tremendous surface splash, GIGI is a cultural treasure, a film to enjoy and cherish forever and certainly a worthy contender for that disputed title of "Hollywood's finest musical." A personal favorite and highly, highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p>
