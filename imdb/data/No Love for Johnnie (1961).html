<h1>No Love for Johnnie (1961)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Johnnie Byrne is a member of the British Parliament. In his 40s, he's feeling frustrated with his life and his personal as well as professional problems tower up over him. His desires to win the next election are endangered by his constant looking for love and he is faced with the choice of giving up a career in politics or giving up the woman he loves.</p>
<p>Representing the Labour Party, popular forty-two year old politician Johnnie Burke has been reelected with a larger majority as a Member of the British Parliament, this time on the governing side. Many speculate that Prime Minister Stephens will offer him a high ranking position in government, but that is not the case. As an ambitious politician, he is privately disappointed, but initially shows public support for his leader's decisions. At home, he is in a long time loveless marriage to Alice, who leaves him, he thinks because he didn't get a post within government. Her departure highlights how much he really craves female companionship, both physically and emotionally. The first woman available to him in both capacities is his lonely but willing neighbor, Mary. But Johnnie eventually meets twenty year old model Pauline West, to who he is immediately attracted. But a married man carrying on with a woman young enough to be his daughter is not compatible with the life of a politician, especially one who is contemplating making an opportunistic move in government. Johnnie has to decide if his personal or political life is more important, especially as women enter and exit his life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>`No Love for Johnnie' is an enjoyable political drama whose sub-plot concerns the doomed love affair between the main character and a much younger woman. The nature of this relationship is undermined by the fact that 42 year old Johnnie Byrne is played by handsome, virile Peter Finch whereas Mary Peach playing 20 looks nearer 30 and Byrne's job as an MP in a Labour government would presumably make him even more attractive - remember Henry Kissinger's remark about the aphrodisiac nature of power?The film takes a conventionally cynical view of politics; the Labour cabinet is referred to as `a gang of lawyers and university lecturers' so nothing much has changed since 1961. I felt that there was one too many shots of the admittedly magnificent Palace of Westminster from the other bank of the Thames and I certainly could not see any reason for Cinemascope as the action is almost exclusively indoors.Stanley Holloway, always good value, playing a fellow-MP acts as a sort of conscious to Byrne but see if you can spot Oliver Reed in one scene with a waste-paper basket over his head, even then a party animal! And the brilliant Billie Whitelaw turns a neighbour who is little more than a doormat into a fully rounded character.Maybe the `red menace' lurking in the background dates `No Love for Johnnie' but I found it most involving.</p>
