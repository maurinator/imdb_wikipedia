<h1>Blue Movie (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Producer/director/cinematographer Andy Warhol presents an afternoon in a Manhattan apartment where Viva and Louis discuss social issues while lying in bed. Louis makes sexual advances and Viva giggles; they indulge in sexual foreplay and then intercourse. They talk about the Vietnam War, watch television, get dressed, eat, discuss Louis's unhappy marriage, and finally take a shower, more and more aware of the presence of a camera. After more sex play in and out of the shower, Viva stares at the camera and asks, "Is it on?"</p>
<p>Viva (playing herself) and Louis Waldon (playing himself) spend an idyllic afternoon together in an apartment in New York City.</p>
