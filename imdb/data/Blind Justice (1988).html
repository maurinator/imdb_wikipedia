<h1>Blind Justice (1988)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great film that was adapted from the novel Hold My Hand I'm Dying by the author John Gordon Davis. The wonderful locations in South Africa reveal a beautiful country against which is set a brutal story. The film captures perfectly the period of time, 1953 when the building of the Kariba Dam flooded the tribal burial grounds and caused the displacement of 57.000 Tonga from their homeland. The environmental impact of this dam and the resentment caused by the forced resettlement of the tribe have had lasting effects which are still present sixty years later. Creating a film from a bestselling novel set on historical events is a daunting challenge. In this case the film has been kept true to the book. Congratulations to director Terence Ryan, I very much enjoyed your film.</p>
