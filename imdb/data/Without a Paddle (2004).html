<h1>Without a Paddle (2004)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three friends, whose lives have been drifting apart, reunite for the funeral of a fourth childhood friend. When looking through their childhood belongings, they discover a trunk which contained details on a quest their friend was attempting. It revealed that he was hot on the trail of the $200,000 that went missing with airplane hijacker D.B. Cooper in 1971. They decide to continue his journey, but do not understand the dangers they will soon encounter.</p>
<p>Four boys grew up as inseparable buddies. Billy Newwood's untimely death and funeral brings them together in a nostalgic mood. Harmless hedonistic jailbird Tom Marshall easily convinces Jerry Conlaine, now a bored and eternally business accountant, and with his help 'outvotes' Dan Mott, a dentist with numerous phobias, it's time to make true an old blood oath. They set out by canoe to make the adventurous journey down the Columbia River which Tommy must have been planning, searching for the treasure of long missing airliner hijacker D.B. Cooper. The mix of belated coming of age and early midlife crisis turns out more adventurous then anyone bargained for: besieged by a grizzly, the elements, a forest-hidden marijuana farming gang and their own frustrations.</p>
<p>Three friends(Seth Green, Dax Shepard, Matthew Lillard) reunite to go on a treasure hunt for D.B Coopers money. Unfortunately, the mountains have serious dangers, such as a grizzly bear and two rednecks who hunt them down for burning their marijuana crop.</p>
<p>This is the story of three friends from the big city of Philadelphia who go canoeing together out in the woods and mountains of Oregon State after the death of a friend, Billy. Billy was obsessed with going there to search for the unaccounted-for $194,200 out of the $200,000 that famed airliner highjacker D.B. Cooper parachuted with quite possibly to his death in 1971 $5,800 of his marked ransom loot was found in 1980. Canoeing down the Columbia River, the trio soon finds that their canoeing experience goes wrong..., both horribly and hilariously wrong, as the river turns dangerous, and they have encounters with the crazy mountain men plays who live near the river...</p>
<p>After their friend dies, three men decide to fulfill their childhood dream by going on a camping expedition for the lost D. B. Cooper bounty, with calamitous results.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Tom, Jerry (!), Billy and Dan are four young kids who fantasise about going on a treasure hunting adventure in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. A legendary rascal called D B Cooper has botched a million dollar heist and left the money in the mountains. The kids make a pact that some day, somehow, they will find that money. Years later, Billy is killed in an accident and the rest reunite for his funeral.Tom (Dax Shepard) is now a sleaze, who cannot hold a steady job to save himself. Jerry (Matthew Lillard) is bored to death in a dull office and by a nagging girlfriend and Dan (Seth Green) has become a very wimpy doctor. Their childhood sense of curiosity and adventure has been extinguished. That is until they happen upon D B Cooper's treasure map in their old tree house gang hut.Desperate for one last act of stupidity before acknowledging their thirties, the trio sets off on a rafting/camping trip, with D B's treasure as their ultimate goal. Of course, many obstacles and disasters prevent them from getting there so easily. Sounds like a grown-up Goonies? It is. And it's loads of fun.Without A Paddle is funny and exciting, with non-stop action and set pieces. Great widescreen photography, pretty scenery and a particularly gentle score make for perfect escapism. There is not one second of boredom. Shepard, Green and Lillard (as always) are brilliant together. Chemistry is difficult to conjure up with three main characters, but they pull it off perfectly.As an Indiana Jones-lite coming-of-age comedy, with the tiniest bit of character drama, Without A Paddle succeeds in every area. But not really a film you would want to watch again.</p>
