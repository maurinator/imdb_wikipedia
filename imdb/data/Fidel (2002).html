<h1>Fidel (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Fact-based (?) drama about the rise of Fidel Castro from a respected lawyer in Cuba to rabble-rousing dissident to power-hungry ruler of his nation. One wonders about the facts in this very homogenized presentation though. The story goes something like this: Fidel meets future wife, gets married, has a child, political aspirations get in way of family, Fidel has a politically-motivated affair, gets thrown in jail, gets expelled from the country, comes back and fights out of the jungle for a few years, casts then leader Baptistsa out of power and seizes leadership. Once seizing power, he kills everyone who opposes him or disagrees with him - although once again this aspect is very watered down. The promised idea of a free election is also quickly dismissed as not in the people's best interests. Fidel's immense popularity with the people at the time of his coming into power is depicted, but the anti-Castro thought is only briefly touched upon in a discussion with a former restaurant worker with whom Castro comes in contact and in follow-up notes at the film's end. The film may have been more successful if it ended at his rise to power as there are way too many unanswered questions about the years that follow. The Cuban missile crisis is only briefly touched upon and Castro's belief that he will be able to work with President Kennedy appears totally naive.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Just for the note, I'm not Diego Luna, that's just my nickname =PShowtime's Fidel has a good start. Terrible ending. Pretty bad for us lefties. Very yankee-made, which doesn't make the film objective at all. Lefties... be warned. Right wingers... enjoy.</p>
