<p>Rémy, a university History professor in Montréal, describes himself as a lusty socialist. He and his ex-wife Louise's marriage broke up long ago because of his philandering, his mistresses including several of their closest mutual friends and some of his students.

And Sébastien wants to throw money at any problem. But in making Rémy's last days comfortable and happy, they may come to the realization that being humanistic trumps all else.</p>

<p>During his final days, a dying man is reunited with old friends, former lovers, his ex-wife, and his estranged son.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented the original film, Decline of the American Empire, before setting out to watch this and I must admit -- it was not very good. In the years since he made it though, Arcand has learned how to direct. Instead of obvious camera setups, there was a precision to what he did here. Instead of the ridiculous tracking shot at the beginning of Decline, Barbarians was in control of the screen at all times. Arcand took the thinnest of reeds -- a man dying -- and made magic out of it.The story of a child reconciling with a dying parent is older than time. But this movie did it with unique touches of pathos and wit. No character was good or bad. They were both.This is a movie that was made for family viewing. Not children, mind you. But grownup parents and their progeny. It will leave you with a lot to talk and think about.</p>
