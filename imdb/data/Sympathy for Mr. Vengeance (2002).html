<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, a work by one of my favorite new directors, was a very different movie then what i originally expected. Having seen Oldboy, I was expecting a much different film. However, Chanwook Park pleasantly surprised me with the first part of his revenge trilogy. The plot line is brutal, but the visceral appeal of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance lies in the motives. Nothing is random, everything is explained, and the viewer can understand why every action is called for. However, this is a brutal movie. The action is tough, the dialogue minimal, with no quick cuts or mindful music. That being said, it is never grotesque and the gore never gets to be too much. The visual images in this movie will stay with you for days, and the cinematography is flawless. I would recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre looking for an exciting new film, and people that do not watch horror movies because they are usually pointless works in gore. Few if any criticisms, the lack of music works both for and against the film, as I found myself sometimes shifting away from the screen. 9 out of 10, highly recommended, but brutal.</p>
