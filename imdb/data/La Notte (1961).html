<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Hush now, don't explain". That's the only thing missing in this wonderful picture of the Maestro: the eternal voice of Billie Holiday over some end-titles. Do not expect explanations, watch the actors carefully and all will be revealed. Neo-realistic ? Sure, look at the rugged camera-angles. A child cries her heart out and we never see her face fully. Of course Lidia walks up to her and strokes the little girls hair smilingly, only to loose interest immediately because of a broken down clock. Symbolism ? Just watch and feel these great actors.</p>
