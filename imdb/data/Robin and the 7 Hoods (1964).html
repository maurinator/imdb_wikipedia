<h1>Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In prohibition-era Chicago, the corrupt sheriff and Guy Gisborne, a south-side racketeer, knock off the boss Big Jim. Everyone falls in line behind Guy except Robbo, who controls the north side. Although he's outgunned, Robbo wants to keep his own territory. A pool-playing dude from Indiana and the director of a boys' orphanage join forces with Robbo; and, when he gives some money to the orphanage, he becomes the toast of the town as a hood like Robin Hood. Meanwhile, Guy schemes to get rid of Robbo, and Big Jim's heretofore unknown daughter Marian appears and goes from man to man trying to find an ally in her quest to run the whole show. Can Robbo hold things together?</p>
<p>In Chicago, during the Prohibition, two rival gangs compete for control of the city's rackets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't want to comment on the quality of the movie, but there are only two movies in my life, that ALWAYS succeed to lighten my mood, when I am sad and down. One is "Robin and the 7 Hoods". (the other is Disney's "Junglebook"). There are much better movies on this planet, but the songs and humor in this one don't let me down. On "Mr. Booze" I show my qualification as a "Seat-Dancer". Hans Conried as the architect makes me laugh my head off, every time. I am a little disappointed that none of the other commentators featured the pool-billiard scene with Dino singing "Any Man who loves his Mother...". Any man who loves this movie is man enough for me...</p>
