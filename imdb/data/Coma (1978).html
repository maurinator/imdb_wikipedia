<h1>Coma (1978)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>

<p>A young woman doctor discovers something sinister going on in her hospital. Relatively healthy patients are having 'complications' during simple operations and ending up in comas. The patients are then shipped off to an institute that looks after them. The young doctor suspects there is more to this than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Dr Susan Wheeler is devastated when her best friend is pronounced brain dead after minor surgery at her hospital. Looking at the records, Susan finds that over the previous year a number of other fit young people have ended up the same way. She comes across two similarities to the cases - they all took place in the same operating theatre, and all the comatose bodies were moved to somewhere called the Jefferson Institute. She continues to investigate increasingly alone, starting to wonder if she can trust even her own boyfriend.</p>

<p>When a young female doctor notices an unnatural amount of comas occurring in her hospital she uncovers a horrible conspiracy.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Man, I had no idea what a good time I was in for with this one.  Chrichton, a young Douglas, Tom Selleck in a minor (but important!) role, and I believe that's a very young Ed Harris playing a morgue attendant/medical examiner.  His line about his wife is one of the funniest in the film.  But seriously, this is very good and very overlooked.  Tight construction, buildup, excellent characterization, swift and unpredicatble plot turns and visually striking scenes.  I don't know how they created the "Institute's" main "storage facility".  If you think about the actors involved in that one, you have to be impressed. And as another comment points out, the chase scene that ends in the freezer room is excellent; creepy and visceral.  The killer , who is really just a hit man for whoever is behind 'the conspiracy' is suitably athletic, anonymous, and menacing.  His sole line : "They told me to make it look like an accident" is extremely scary and effective - when coupled with his actions during the maintenance man scene.  Good writing, Michael.   Ane the suspense during the finale, well they just don't make'em like this anymore.  Very enjoyable.</p>
