<h1>N.Y., N.Y. (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A nearly-wordless collage that follows a day in New York City from early morning to late at night. The day starts with a look at power generators, ready to light the city. At eight, an alarm clock goes off, people go to work on the subway, type, and break for lunch. In the evening, night clubs and jazz take over. The images are fanciful, abstract, and multiple, suggesting a kaleidoscope of color and activity. The soundtrack is light, breezy, and staccato. New York City is a place of bridges, skyscrapers, and motion.</p>
<p>A day in the life of the city and citizens of New York as seen through the fantastic eye, and the incredibly distorted optic lenses, of filmmaker Francis Thompson.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>On a recent blog on the Cartoon Brew site, there was an article about this unique short film from an artist named Francis Thompson. As you can probably figure out from the title, it's mainly images of perhaps the greatest city of our country (if not the world). And what images you see! Accompanied by a very compellingly jazzy/symphonic score by Gene Forrell, there's a kaleidescope of split-screen images going every which way with some unique ones like that of a typewriter printing symbols instead of words. You also hear some sound effects like that of an alarm clock. And how about the way some images-like a car or buildings-just simply fold into each other. I think I've said enough so if you want to know what I'm writing about, go to the UbuWeb site where this short is available. So yes, I'm definitely recommending N.Y., N.Y., A Day in New York.</p>
