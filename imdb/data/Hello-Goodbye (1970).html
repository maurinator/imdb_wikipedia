<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Legendary producer and Fox mogul Darryl F. Zanuck, at the end of his career, supervised the production of this vanity project for his latest "protege", Genvieve Gilles. There's obviously no real script here, just an excuse for a location shoot in the south of France with lots of Genvieve naked, the result of an over-the-hill producer having a mid life crisis as his studio was being taken from his control. This film has nothing at all going for it, other than showing off Gilles' rather ample endowments, and even THAT gets boring after awhile, because she's so laughably bad, and not sensual or sexy at all. Film gets a slight lift from the presence of Curt Jurgens, and when he first appears about 40 minutes into the proceedings, you realize that finally, there's a real actor in this thing.Hello-Goodbye was a major reason why 20th Century-Fox almost went under again in 1970, just barely having survived the Cleopatra debacle seven years earlier. This, from the man who produced "The Grapes of Wrath", proves what we all know: that a c%nt hair CAN pull an ocean liner.....</p>
