<h1>Caddyshack II (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jack Hartounian, a self made man is trying to get into Bushwood County Club because his daughter's being asked by her snooty friends. Jack applies but a few things ruins his application, one that he's extremely boorish and because he is building low cost housing in an affluent neighborhood. Jack then turns to Ty Webb who owns the majority share of the club, Jack buys Ty's shares and then takes over the club and makes some changes which the members don't like. That's when the club members attack Jack by stopping his housing project. Eventually they decide to settle it on the golf course but the club president decides to take contingencies.</p>
<p>Kate Hartounian is a young girl with a snotty rich friend who wants Kate and her father, Jack, to become members at a high-class golf club. Everything is going fine until the current members meet Jack. His application to join is rejected. In retaliation, Jack buys the rights to the club and turns it into an amusement park-type golf club. In order to settle things once and for all, the two sides face off in a golf match.</p>
<p>When a crass new-money tycoon's membership application is turned down at a snooty country club, he retaliates by buying the club and turning it into a tacky amusement park.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A while ago I attempted to sit through the entire Caddyshack epic back-to-back, but part II took me three sittings.  I toughed it out though. I'm not a quitter.What happened here?  What somehow made the original a classic lies with the filmmakers' decision to toss the script more-or-less and rely on the improvisational genius of the veteran comics.  Here, the viewer is dragged though a lifeless, by-the-numbers 80s light comedy PLOT and left feeling hurt and confused and certainly not filled with mirth.  Oh sure, you've got the talents of Jonathan Silverman AND Marsha Warfield (I keep waiting for some forward thinking, cutting edge network to bring back her talk show) vying for your attentions IN THE SAME MOVIE!  And you get to see Jackie Mason in a lead role!  That's not enough?  Well, the two returning characters, Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and the gopher certainly pull their weight.  Chase has no shame and everybody knows it.  Robert Stack could make Hooked On Phonics sound like Crime and Punishment, so there's no fault there.  Quaid and Akyroid are annoying as always....Oh, I thought of something good!  The Kenny Loggins theme song is fantastic! Far superior to his contribution to the original Caddyshack.  Whenever I face a challenge in life, I am heartened by thinking of this inspirational song.  "I'm goin' all the way"!  I was pleased to see that it appears on a 2 disc best of Kenny Loggins.  Good call.</p>
