<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In Italy, handsome singer Pat Boone (as Eddie) attracts the attention of ventriloquist Mai Zetterling (as Gina), a sexy older woman scouting a new partner for both her act and the sack. After some liquor, Mr. Boone dons his leather jacket and goes to live with Ms. Zetterling. They decide to flaunt their affair, which comes as no surprise to the circus veterans in the troupe as Zetterling has had a string of young lovers. Zetterling runs her eyes over Boone's body and purrs, "I like everything about you!" Apparently more than satisfied, the older woman lets out a primal scream when she loses her mate...On arrival, Boone meets Italian bareback rider Nancy Kwan (as Tessa), and runs his eyes over her body. The movie's tag-line declares Pat Boone gets "in trouble with that 'Suzie Wong' girl," but he thinks Kwan is just his style. The two become mutually attracted, but Kwan is harder to get. Meanwhile, Zetterling notices Boone's "lusty" wandering eye and threatens him with their ventriloquist doll "Lady Godiva". Boone can hardly see his guitar strings over her protruding bust when singing, "Si, Si, Si!" Watch for a circus mishap to change everyone's lives...This strange film can perhaps be described as an Elvis Presley-type vehicle with the sexual content turned up (for a mainstream 1962 movie, at least). It must have been startling to see Boone drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and characterized as sexually active. Release in the US was put off, and likely limited. In the UK, Boone's accompanying single "The Main Attraction" became his final hit, topping "Love Me Do" for awhile, before succumbing to The Beatles' first hit.** The Main Attraction (11/62) Daniel Petrie ~ Pat Boone, Nancy Kwan, Mai Zetterling, Yvonne Mitchell</p>
