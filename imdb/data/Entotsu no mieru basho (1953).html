<h1>Entotsu no mieru basho (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Where Chimneys Are Seen focuses primarily on the interconnected lives of two couples in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in Senju, a poor industrial section of Tokyo.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another strong postwar melodrama of hard, hard times in Japan. This one,  however, has the heartbreak undercut with a certain hopefulness and humor. A little uneven at times, and the character who starts out as the storyteller falls  into the background. Still, if you get a chance to see this(it's not on video or DVD) jump at it. Nine out of ten.</p>
