<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are movies that one sees as a child that should never be viewed again as an adult and this is one of them. I had fond memories of this sword and sandal epic from my formative years and should not have watched it again recently.I had obviously forgotten that the giants referred to in the title do not appear until about five minutes before the end and are barely an inch or more taller than Goliath himself.They are also ponderously slow moving and stupid and are defeated with the minimum of effort by our titular hero.Brad Harris as Goliath,however,was one of the more effective performers in this genre and if nothing else this movie is good for a laugh.</p>
