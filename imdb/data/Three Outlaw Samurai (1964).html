<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Three Outlaw Samurai is a relentlessly thrilling Samurai movie full of twists and betrayals.After a title sequence with a bombastic score, the action begins almost immediately in this film. A wandering Samurai stumbles upon a hostage situation - a few pathetic peasants (not too different from the ones in Seven Samurai) are holding the daughter of an aristocrat hostage in the hope that he would waive taxes. After observing the bumbling peasants and their failed negotiations with the aristocracy for a while, the cynical Samurai decides to join the fight on the peasants side.While watching this film, it struck me that the Samurai attitude towards life is not too different from the cowboys in spaghetti westerns or protagonists in Noir thrillers. They are very cynical and are always watching how the situation unravels. But they often put their neck on the line in the end.The treatment and portrayal of women in this film is quite hilarious and politically incorrect.I liked the way the director balanced the different aspects of the film the film is a mix of cynical tongue in cheek humor and relentlessaction while also foregrounding themes like samurai honor and the plight of peasants.The plot, like a Noir film is quite complicated.(7.5/10)</p>
