<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>England, 1904. A young lawyer from London, Mr. Ashton (James Wilby) and his best friend are hiking across Dartmoor. As he twisted his ankle, Ashton is forced to seek help at a nearby farmhouse and stay there for a few days. Innocent beauty Megan David (Imogen Stubbs) catches the attention of Ashton. He decides to stay longer, and he and Megan fall in love, much to the displeasure of Megan's aunt (Susannah York) and her loutish son (Jerome Flynn). Before Ashton leaves the farm, he vows to return and take Megan away with him.</p>
<p>Ashton leaves the farm for city but falls in love with a wealthy girl. Meagan visits the city to look for him and for a moment gets a glimpse of him but he ducks. He decides that Meagan is not suitable for him and avoids her. He marries the wealthy girl. Meagan returns to farm and later realizes she is pregnant with Ashton's child. As her pregnancy progresses, she falls sick. She delivers a baby boy but dies during childbirth. 18 years later, Ashton is passing by the village and decides to recall old memories. A local farmer recognizes him but Ashton pretends that he is a different person. He makes inquiries about Meagan and is distraught to learn that she passed away giving birth to a boy. Ashton inquires about the child. The farmer tells him that he shepherds sheep nearby. Upon inquiry by farmer, Ashton tells him that he (Ashton) did (could) not have children of his own. As Ashton is returning in his car, he is shocked to see the boy (his own son), a young Ashton lookalike! The film ends as the young Ashton wishes old one with a smile.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I watched this movie way back in 1995 on Star Movies. It was not recommended and I was just changing channels when I stumbled upon this movie (luckily). It had just started so I thought I'll just check the start and I couldn't change the channel till it was over. A brilliant movie. The name of the movie struck me. I have a few friends who are movie buffs and I had told them about this movie but they had not seen this movie, I thought it was odd that only I liked this movie. But now after reading all the reviews, I'm glad that there are so many people who appreciate this movie. It really is a movie many have not seen.What can I say about the movie, it's mesmerizing. Strongly recommended. Just go for it, worth an experience.</p>
