<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have never commented on Elvis Presley although I like his musical style now more than ever compared to the loud hysterical noise we have today. I saw this movie yesterday on AMC TV and by golly it was a good entertaining movie, songs were good, the thin story line was decent, and the Hawaii scenery beautiful and gorgeous; what a backdrop for any musical!  Elvis was the only famous character in it, but it was so enjoyable, I could see it again!  I thought Elvis was good also in that movie "Love Me Tender", but all the others were just so-so.</p>
