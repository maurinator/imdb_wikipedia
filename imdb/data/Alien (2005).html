<h1>Alien (2005)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An investigation into the serious stabbing of a grade-school boy uncovers a suspect whose trial becomes about the rights of same-sex parents.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I realize that Dick Wolf is a huge contributor to the DNC, but he certainly went out of his way with this episode, although I wouldn't have been surprised by hard left West Wing loon Lawrence O'Donnell.According to Wolf: Anyone who disagrees with same sex parents is a bigot/anti same sex and is probably a member of the radical right to boot; Anyone who believes in the above "lives in a red state"; and One of the attorneys gave false same sex parental info to their client, which was deemed "a serious ethical offense" by the judge.But you are an L&O fan that likes leftist propaganda, you'll love this episode.</p>
