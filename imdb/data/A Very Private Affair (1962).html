<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>For the record, I saw the dubbed version.  But for the first hour, there is so little dialogue, I don't think it could matter very much. This early Malle film spends so much time on Bardot's character's angst and yearning for her own time and space that you might be tempted to turn it off.  Don't, but if you have it on tape, you may wish to fast forward. The second third of the movie is a never-ending cliche.  As a reward, the ending is rich, vibrant, and celebratory.</p>
