<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't know why I like this film. It might have to do with the fact that when I was a young kid I was in love with monster trucks. The sight of all that destruction was exactly what my 9 year old brain needed. This is a pretty terrible movie as it turns out, but it was fun at the time. Oh well, a guilty pleasure for me anyhow.</p>
