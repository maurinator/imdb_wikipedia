<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Sharma brothers consist of former boxer, Brijmohan; Jagmohan, an Electrical Engineer; and Manmohan, a Mechanic. The brothers operate a garage under the name of 'Mohan Brothers' in Bombay. Brijmohan hates all women and does not permit even a poster to be hung on the walls of either the garage or their residence as well as instructs his brothers not to get involved with them. While working the late shift, Manmohan assists a customer, Renu, and both rather dramatically fall in love. Subsequently, Jagmohan meets with Renu's friend, Sheila, and both are attracted to each other. Unable to face the wrath of their brother, both conceal this information from him. Then the duo find out that their brother hides a woman's photograph under his pillow, but when confronted, refuses to divulge any information to them. Things will change rapidly when Manmohan finds out Renu's father, Kishinchand, has made arrangements for his daughter's to wed Prakashchand, the son of Raja Hardayal Singh.</p>
<p>Three woman-hating brothers face changes in their respective lifestyles when two of them fall in love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I suppose that much of what I found hard to watch about this film was due to the cultural differences between what I find to be entertaining and what the expectations of a Bollywood aficionado would be. For one thing, the song and dance numbers were tremendously over-long and primitive in execution and the glue that held them together (the story) wasn't at all compelling.I'm sure that there were funny bits that were lost on me since I didn't speak the language, but musicals and comedic films from other languages including Hong Kong action films and Japanese comedies work just fine for me.And I was looking for the similarities to the Marx Brothers mentioned in previous comments about the film. I didn't see it with the exception of the conceit that the three main characters were brothers. In fact, the relationship that they had reminded me more of the Three Stooges rather than the Marx Brothers.Oh, and whomever released this on DVD made it so the viewer had to sit through about fifteen advertisements for their other DVD releases. I can understand the average of four trailers on a DVD but this was ridiculous.</p>
