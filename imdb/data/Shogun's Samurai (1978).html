<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After the second Tokugawa Shogun has died unexpectedly but mysteriously, the is a struggle for succession between two of his sons.Though the history is bogus, there are plenty of opportunities for Samurai fighting. It is also well written and acted.Wonderful color, costumes, sets and countryside in widescreen. A grade A production all around.</p>
