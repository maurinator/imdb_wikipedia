<h1>Gunn (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Peter Gunn investigates the murder of Scarlotti, a mobster who once saved the detective's life. The primary suspect appears to be Fusco, who has taken over. In the middle of the case, an unclothed woman calling her self Samantha shows up at Gunn's apartment. The investigation gets grizzlier as it goes on, including the bombing of Mother's, one of Gunn's hangouts. Finally, Fusco gives Gunn a deadline to prove the mobster didn't kill Scarlotti - or else Gunn will be killed.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was based upon the highly regarded "Peter Gunn" television series that ran from 1958 to 61.  Running for five seasons to the unforgettable title theme and background music of early Henry Mancini, the show set a standard for script writing that proved, beyond doubt, television writing need not be the 'medium of 'hacks': even within the limits of a thirty minute format interrupted by commercials.  This big screen treatment starring, once again, Craig Stevens as the suave, indomitable Gunn, failed at the box office, more a casualty of the changing times than the writing and acting-both of which were superb.  Unfortunately this cinematic outing in color dimmed slightly in comparison to the television series that was shot, quite effectively, in a film noir format reminiscent of detective films of the 40's.  Regardless, the crisp story line and plot is intriguing from beginning to end, with the intentional humor never once tripping over the drama (credit writer William Peter Blatey). I must admit, however, I truly missed two key characters from the original series played by Herschel Bernardi and Lola Albright: their replacements were nowhere near as effective. Nevertheless, the performance of Craig Stevens must be credited for recapturing the intellectually glib character of the title character,Peter Gunn: the thinking man's 'gumshoe'. This film deserves to be seen by all those who love a really good detective story.</p>
