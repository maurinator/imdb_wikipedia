<h1>Ragtime (2014)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Detective Murdoch investigates the murder of Nathan Peters, a jazz musician and renowned band-leader, who was found dead at the docks. His group, the Jubilee Singers, was performing nearby and his wife had already reported him missing. Dr. Emily Grace determines that he died in the early hours of the morning from a blow to the head causing a subdural hemorrhage. The evidence in the case begins to point to one of the Jubilee Singers as the perpetrator. Much to George Crabtree's chagrin, Emily seems to have taken an interest in the roguish Leslie Garland. Julia meanwhile feels that a huge weight has been taken off her shoulders now that James Gillian is dead.</p>
