<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Why, of all the slasher films to come out of the early '80's, that Graduation Day is so well remember I will never know. Graduation Day is a far cry from some of the better '80's slashers, but it isn't the bottom of the barrel either.After a high school track star literally runs herself to death, someone begins to kill the remaining members of the track team. But for what reason?Graduation Day is a slasher film that's served with a big slice of cheese. You've got some corny characters, some unneeded musical numbers (not including the funky song in the opening montage), and some bad acting - no wonder Vanna White is only spinning letters now. But it has some merits too. There are some amusing murder sequences and the story manages to be engaging - if only for the campy elements. So when all is said and done, you can do worse. But it's not worth missing The Burning, Curtains, or House on Sorority Row for.** out of ****</p>
