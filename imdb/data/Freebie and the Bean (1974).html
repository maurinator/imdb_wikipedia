<h1>Freebie and the Bean (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Freebie and Bean, two San Francisco police detectives, have one goal in life: to bring down Red Meyers, a local hijacking boss. After many fruitless months they finally collect an important piece of evidence. However, before they can get an arrest warrant, they hear the news of the hitman being hired to kill Meyers.</p>
<p>Freebie and Bean are somewhat bumbling odd couple partnered SFPD detectives with the Intelligence Squad. Despite their different natures, they have each other's back, especially when it comes to their so far fourteen month investigation against racketeer Red Meyers, who is well-connected in all the right places. They finally have the first shred of physical evidence against Meyers to corroborate the insider account of a lowlife named Harry Motley, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Despite the flimsy evidence and no Motley, they believe they have no choice but to bring in Meyers on any charge when they learn there is a contract hit out on Meyers, the hit man named Michigan Phil. Based on this information and recent knowledge that Motley is returning to town on Monday, the D.A., concerned primarily with maintaining his high successful prosecution rate and getting the highers-up off his back, recommends they release Meyers, but make sure he stays alive until Monday when they can bring both Meyers and Motley in. Their inconspicuous shadowing of Meyers in protecting him against Michigan Phil and any other potential attempts on his life is made all the more difficult as it is Super Bowl weekend, the game being held in San Francisco, and as especially Bean's thoughts steer toward the growing evidence that Bean's Latina wife is having an affair.</p>
<p>San Francisco police detectives Freebie and Bean are determined to bust local crime boss Red Meyers at any cost, even if this means destroying the whole city in the process.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is both odd and quite funny. I saw Freebie And The Bean at the theater and laughed so hard I was actually asked to leave. It's always a pleasure to watch Alan Arkin work, and he works so well playing off James Caan, who's fantastic in this film, too. Be forewarned, though, if you're bothered by things politically incorrect, you may be offended by Freebie And The Bean.The story is unimportant because it's the comic skits that make this movie work. Freebie (James Caan) is part of a detective team who thinks the major part of his benefit package is whatever he can walk away with, while  Bean (Alan Arkin) plods along worrying that his wife is having an affair with the landscaper. Freebie and the Bean crashing their car off an overpass and into the upper floor of an apartment building, Freebie giving Bean a fashion lesson about why buttons don't fall off of expensive shirts, or Bean grilling his wife, played by Valerie Harper, attempting to catch her in a lie about the suspected affair....these are worth watching the film for and are some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. Keep in mind, though, this movie is quite violent and there's this fantastic trans-gendered character who seems to offend alot of folks as well.I'll own this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD and I totally recommend it.</p>
