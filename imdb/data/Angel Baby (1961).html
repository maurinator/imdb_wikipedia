<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Judging by this movie, you never would have guessed what lay ahead for Hollywood legend George Hamilton and future number one movie star in the world Burt Reynolds.Plot In A Paragraph: A woman who believes she has been chosen by God to heal people is taken in by a greedy promoter and his wife to make the rounds of the rural South - she to save souls and heal the sick, he to make as much money as he possibly can.I was not very entertained watching this, and I only made it all the way through because of George Hamilton and a young Burt Reynolds. This was Burt Reynolds first role and I found the movie less interesting when he was not on the screen. Even if his character Hook Adams was the local thug in the picture. That said Reynolds fight with Hamilton is awfully staged, and you can see their youthful inexperience.</p>
