<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Lovers Of The Arctic Circle" When "Map Of The Human Heart" is one of my favorite movies, I can't fault this film for almost stealing the entire concept.  A Spanish language film about two children who meet at school and fall in love with each other.  Through the years, the two manage to carry out a sexual relationship even as their respective parents marry each other and outside forces try to separate them.  The rest of the film is nearly a scene by scene recreation of 1993's "Map". But I stress that I liked this film.  Cinematographer Gonzalo F. Berridi and Director Julio Medem make a very specific effort to make their film visually memorable. Some of the shots on display here are breathtaking.  Leads Najwa Nimri and Fele Martinez do a wonderful job as the two lovers.  Their scenes of courtship are fascinating to watch and Medem sharply chooses to show both sides of the story.  By understanding the two perspectives on this plot, the film is that much more satisfying.  I enjoyed this story. I applaud the effort the filmmakers made to not tell this story in any way I might have suspected.  It's a slippery slope when it comes to melodramatic romance, yet the film is graceful and competent. ---------------- 8</p>
