<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen this film twice, and will see it again .  It is a wonderful movie.  I guess it was released the wrong year, because it certainly deserves awards.  It is the best movie of this genre that I have ever seen!  It tops them all. I found it to be touching, and yet realistic.  I think it will inspire those who watch it.  It certainly inspired me to be more kind and compassionate towards others, especially towards those who have a handicap.  The film touched my heart! If you can find this movie on television, or at the rental place,see it.  You will not be disappointed.</p>
