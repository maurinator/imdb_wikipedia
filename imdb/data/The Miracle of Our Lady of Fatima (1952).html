<h1>The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1917, three shepherd children living just outside Fatima, Portugal have visions of a lovely lady in a cloud. The anticlerical government wishes to squelch the Church; reports of religious experiences are cause for serious concern. Yet the children stand by their story, and the message of peace and hope the Lady brings. In the last vision, attended by thousands of people, the Lady proves her reality with a spectacular miracle that is seen by everyone present. Based on actual events at Fatima in the summer of 1917.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a splendid, meaningful film in the spiritual genre which details the visions claimed by three Portuguese children during the height of tumultuous events in Europe preceding the rise of communism in Russia. The film briefly underscores the persecution of the Catholic Church in Portugal at the turn of the last century. Enough humor, vis a vis the fictitious character "Hugo" the local village thief, inebriate and film-flam artist, is injected into the movie which offsets the sombre subject matter. The children are at first disbelieved, and the local priest fears further persecution at the hands of the local authorities should the details of the children's visions come to light. The children are hounded by the authorities who attempt to compel them to recant, all to no avail. Hugo tries to make money out of the venture by selling 'relics' to the thousands of pilgrims who flock to the site in search of a miracle. The film concludes with the 'vision of the sun' whirling and descending to the earth during a violent rainstorm, after which it returns to its designated spot in the heavens. A fine family film. Well cast and thoroughly delightful to watch.</p>
