<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Few people like this film as much as my family and I, but we never miss it when it comes on TV. Perhaps that's because we've sailed the Caribbean and can relate to the misadventures of the characters in the movie. It's a terrific family film.Kurt Russell is hysterical as the one-eyed Captain Ron. Martin Short, for a change, plays the straight man. The rest of the cast are cute and funny. By the end of the movie, I actually found myself nostalgic for the sense of freedom and fun that only Captain Ron can steer you towards. I gave this movie a 9; don't throw me overboard for that!Hamilton Fisher</p>
