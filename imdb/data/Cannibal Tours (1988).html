<h1>Cannibal Tours (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When tourists journey to the furthermost reaches of the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea, is it the indigenous tribespeople or the white visitors who are the cultural oddity? This film explores the difference (and the surprising similarities) that emerge when "civilized" and "primitive" people meet. With dry humor and acute observation CANNIBAL TOURS explodes cultural assumptions as it provides a pointed look at a fabulous phenomenon.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here's my reading of Dennis O'Rourkes excellent documentary.The film was made at a time 1987, released 1989, according to IMDb, when the Australian and western multinationals were making a presence into Papua New Guinea to exploit gold, copper, oil and mining interests among other things. It was around this time that the Bougainville rebellion started as a reaction to this exploitation of the people and resources and lasted 10 years and many were killed. The metaphorical statement O'Rourke is making is typified by eh American tourist at the end of the film stating she'll be back again next year with a truck to take away all the artifacts. She is carrying with her several wooden phallic objects a sure analogy for the white corporate raiders who have taken the manhood away from the locals</p>
