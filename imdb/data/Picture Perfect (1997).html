She even gets the attention of a colleague she had always wanted, but events soon take a dramatic turn, forcing her to 'present' her alleged fiance to her boss.</p>
<p>A young advertising executive's life becomes increasingly complicated when, in order to impress her boss, she pretends to be engaged to a man she has just met.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kate (Jennifer Aniston) is a rising star at a big advertising company. Nevertheless, when she receives no credit for a winning ad, Kate seeks advice. The buzz is that, because she is not married or does not have a family, the company is reluctant to promote her, thinking she might jump ship in the future. Shortly after learning this, Kate attends a wedding and asks Nick, a gentleman she meets there, to play the part of her fianc√© for a spell. Now, Kate is taken more seriously when she brings Nick along to company functions. Will there be any promotions or romantic complications in her future? This has got to be one of the best movies Aniston ever made. She is adorable and funny, she looks like a dream, and she handles the serious moments of the film with ease. Jay Mohr turns in a very likable performance as Nick and Kevin Bacon charms the audience in a lesser role. The plot was fun at full speed and the script has many memorable lines. If you are an aficionado of romance films, told with humor, and you love women with beauty, brains, and Buster Keaton's comic timing, don't hesitate to seek out this film while it may be found.</p>
