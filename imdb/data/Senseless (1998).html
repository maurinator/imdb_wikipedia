<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I forget when the first time I saw this was, but I laughed a lot.  When I went and rented it, I did it for another reason.  Because of Myst III: Exile, I quickly became a big fan of Brad Dourif.  When I remembered this movie, I had to see it again.  This one was a big plus, because he had a bigger role in it than most movies.  It was a nice bonus because there were other actors I was fans of in it as well.  Matthew Lillard and David Spade are also people I'm fans of.  Rip Torn did a very nice job.  The Wayans guy was ok, I guess...  :)This movie had what I needed though.  Hockey, girls, college, experimental drugs... Oops.  I liked it.Yea Brad Dourif!</p>
