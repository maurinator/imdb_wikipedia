<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>...ing, excellent movie and definitely one of my favorite movie in Korean side. am not a Korean, but really like this movie very much This story is all about daughter-mother relationship as well as daughter-her lover relationship..A simple storyline, but as they so often are, so wonderfully told. A girl with a terminal disease falls for the boy who lives downstairs from her. Nothing more, nothing less. But the acting ability, and the brilliant writing keep this movie moving along with joy, even tho deep deep down, you know its going to end in tragedy.If you are a fan of Korean movies. Then you must see ...ing. i bet you'll cry your heart out at the end of movie. Korean film makers are miles ahead of Hollywood film makers when it comes to romantic movies</p>
