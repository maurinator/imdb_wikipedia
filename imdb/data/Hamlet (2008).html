<h1>Hamlet (2008)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not art and neither is it a film. It is a white screen created by a moron who thinks he can do anything and simply call it art. I've seen some bad visual art in my time (on par with the 'Mirror, Father, Mirror' scene in Ghost World), but this isn't even trying to have a meaning.Just sticking the name of a real work of art (be it a play, a religious text or a novel) on the title, calling it the artist's "vision" of it does not make it art if all it is is a coloured (or not coloured) screen. It is nothing but a shameless cash in on other, real works of art that have already got such a following that this hack thinks he can leech off them somehow.Luckily it seems everyone is able to see this hack for what he truly is a fraud.</p>
