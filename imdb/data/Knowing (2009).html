<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have read a lot of totally negative views about this film, and so I can only say that some people simply have no imagination."Knowing" works at every level. It is a brilliantly executed film. And the final is breathtaking.I watched this film with my wife and we are not easily pleased movie watchers.I find myself being critical of the negative reviews, because I am astounded at their lack of imagination.Without imagination, we would never have had The Time Machine thanks to Herbert George Wells. This is just one example.Another is Steven Spielberg's "Close Encounters". Imagination is the key word here, and so many reviewers did not have any whatsoever.Knowing kept my wife and I on the edge of our seats, it was clever, it was imaginative, it was first class.</p>
