<h1>Oh, God! (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jerry Landers, a supermarket assistant manager and a good yet non-religious person, suddenly finds a note in the mail one day that grants him an "interveiw" with God. Thinking it to be a hoax he tosses it away, but when it keeps reappearing he finally gives in. Skeptical at first, he ends up carrying His personal message - that the world can work with what God's given us.</p>
<p>When God appears to an assistant grocery manager as a good natured old man, the Almighty selects him as his messenger for the modern world.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film which is not only a wonderful comedy but one which amplified & interpreted my own experience.   What I mean is: I was much taken by the theological points put into the mouth of God by the scriptwriters.   I found myself thinking "what God is saying adds up for me.   It's the kind of God I want to believe in".</p>
