<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Peyton Flanders (Rebecca De Mornay) seemed to be the perfect nanny, but secretly she was out to wreck the lives of the family she was supposed to be helping. Before becoming the nanny, Peyton had a miscarriage due to the stress caused by the death of her husband, Dr. Victor Mott (John de Lancie), and blamed it on Claire (the mother, played by Annabella Sciorra),. Claire suspects nothing, having never met Peyton before.</p>
<p>Dr. Victor Mott is a respected and successful gynecologist, but his respect and success both come to a crashing halt when he is accused of sexually molesting his patients. When Claire Bartel accuses him of this crime, four other women come forward to corroborate the story and also accuse the doctor. Stripped of his license and on the verge of being sent to prison, Dr. Mott commits suicide. As if this were not enough of a blow to Dr. Mott's now-widowed wife, she suffers a miscarriage, losing her unborn baby as well, and is on the verge of losing her home to civil judgments against her husband's estate. Broken, alone and now near-penniless to boot, Mrs. Mott learns that Claire is seeking a nanny for her own young children, and sees this as the perfect tool to exact a bloody revenge on Claire Bartel, and take Claire's family for her own...</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>the hand that rocks the cradle was a very gripping psychological thriller, there is hardly any action or violence in the movie till the very end. the suspense and the thrills are at a very psychological level and this is what makes this movie rise above the ordinary, rebecca de mornay as the psychologically imbalanced nanny is terrific. the script was surprisingly good for a large part and the thrills were built up very convincingly.there is obviously a lot of situations that defy belief, but with a little suspension of disbelief, they can be accepted. the cast is ordinary, and the performances of the young couple was very amateurish, as also the performance of ernie hudson as the mentally challenged person.this movie would have been a lot more thrilling and dark and satisfying if it had not towards the end fallen in a whole deluge of cliches and predictable lame movie ending traps. call me sick, but i think the movie would have been far better with a darker ending.on the whole a thrilling 8!</p>
