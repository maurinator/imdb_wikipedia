<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie recently and was amazed by the quality of the hilarious comedy that this film offers. It beats the films of these days in terms of comedy. Kishor Daa has had a tremendous role and everything in the movie is up to the mark. I recommend everyone at least give it a chance and you will be a happy person on earth. Each scene of the film has something in it to make you laugh. You will be a laughing bag at the end. And then the film has a romantic story too which has a happy ending. A must watch for everyone. Even if it is black and white movie, the excellent movie that it is makes it a treat to watch. A lot of scenes has some fancy stuff in it that makes one think what quality the movies of earlier era had in them. Then the music quality of the movie is some of the best. The song that Kishor sings in both male and female voice is the most hilarious. This song is made alive by the play made by Kishor Kumar.</p>
