<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A year after the classic 'Deewaar' (1975), the Yash Chopra-Amitabh-Shashi combination joined forces once again. But unlike the hard-hitting action-drama, this time they teamed up for a simple, poetic romantic drama.I am normally a big fan of multi-starrers and family dramas and this is a big reason for my liking this film. The film has about 9 central characters and all of them manage to leave a mark. Also a film starring Big B and Shashi Kapoor is always a must-watch for me. The crackling chemistry they shared between them was far superior to any of the leading heroines of those times. No wonder they did more films together than with any particular heroine!But in most of these films there is a perennial complaint of Big B tending to overshadow Shashi. But 'Kabhi Kabhie' is a heart-warming exception. Not just compared to Bachchan; but out of the entire bouquet of characters, it's Shashi who creates the biggest impression. His ever- smiling charming persona with a big heart of gold, is a complete delight. My favourite scene was where he went under the table to snoop on his son's telephonic conversation. Also the confrontation scene between him and Bachchan towards the end was terrific. It's just for him, that one could see the film time and again!The other attraction of the film is we get to see stars like Big B, Shashi, Rakhee and Waheeda Rehman, who were in their youth; being projected in older roles. If these characters were to be played by actors who matched the age, then the film would lose half the charm.One expects a tight narration in multi-starrers; but here the tone was kept deliberately simple. It's obvious from the start that it's gonna be a very poetic film. But unfortunately this makes the film quite boring and monotonous at parts. In fact the original premise of the Amitabh- Rakhi romance ultimately turns out to be a mere subplot. One certainly expected something more here. But just on the verge of the climax where it appeared we were headed for a melodramatic finish, we are treated to a sudden chase-sequence which was a delightful surprise. The sequence is brilliantly shot with horses, jeeps and motorbikes embroiled in a trail with blasts going off on the picturesque Kashmir mountains behind. It's the ideal finish required for a film like this.Music by Khayyam and lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi are highlights of the film. But there are just too many songs in the 2nd half which obstructs the pace of the film.This was a terrific example of the versatility of Chopra who could switch effortlessly between two diverse genres. Although, he is mostly remembered as a 'King of Romance', personally I find him more capable in the action-ventures like 'Deewaar', (1975) 'Trishul' (1978) and 'Kala Patthar' (1979). As a result, 'Kabhi Kabhie' fails to match up to those standards; but is still the best romantic film of Chopra after 'Chandni' (1989).Many consider it to be a great romantic film or even a poetic film. But for me, this film is special just because of Shashi, the star-cast and for getting to see a whole bunch of actors playing characters far older than their real age!</p>
