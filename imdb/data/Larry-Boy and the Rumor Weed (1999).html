<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Spoofing Batman, Larry Boy and the Rumor Weed delivers the laughs we've come to expect from those limbless vegetables. The thing I found odd was this was the first Veggie Tales to not feature Bob the Tomato...doesn't matter, Larry's everyone's favorite, right?Remember that old cereal motto, "Kid Friendly, Mother Approved?" Same with Veggie Tales-"Kid Friendly, Adult enthused!"John "Larry Boy" Ulmer</p>
