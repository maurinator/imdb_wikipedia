<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the 1960's, you could not argue with the star power of Shirley MacLaine.  She was probably in at least twenty movies in that decade.  This is a worthy showcase to her talent and hold ups well for the most part.  The movie is very funny in parts and when its not out-and-out funny, you are still smiling.  Its nice to see Paul Newman and Robert Mitchum in a light comedy, and Dean Martin and Dick Van Dyke were good also. Margaret Dumont as Shirley's mother was very funny and I was sorry she was not in more scenes.  All those years of sharing a screen with the Marx Brothers certainly rubbed off.I would love to know which men were offered parts but did not appear in the movie - like, where is Jack Lemmon and Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford? Edith Head must have billed 20th Century Fox for a million hours of OT.  She creates about six hundred costumes for Shirley and the guys.  I think she got a nomination for this, but then again, in her case that's not saying anything special.</p>
