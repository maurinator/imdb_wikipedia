<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Karan Arjun was one of the best movie of its time.It was really cool.The plot was something crisp.The script was in-shape.SRK was good.Salman was average.I don't wan't talk about the lackluster acting by Kajol and Mamta.They really were a piece of junk.The songs were good enough.The music was nothing new.The directions were 'kind-of-good'.Overall, Enjoyable flick!</p>
