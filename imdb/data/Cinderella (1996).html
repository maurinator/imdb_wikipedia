<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Watching Burbank Animation Studios' animations on old VHS was part of my childhood. Despite being a favourite story of mine, this Cinderella was not one of the ones I loved to watch constantly as a kid(Hansel and Gretel and Pocahontas were my favourites then) and is not one of Burbank's best to me(The Count of Monte Cristo). It may have its problems, such as some stiff character designs like with the Prince, some corny dialogue and some inconsistent voice acting, Cinderella being the best and the Stepmother being the worst), on the other hand there are some virtues. The colours are nice and the backgrounds have some good fluidity. The transformation sequence is both magical and charming. The music is simple and sweet, while the story sticks to the story I know and love and has much of its impact. Most of the characters are fine, Cinderella is an endearing protagonist, the Fairy Godmother is suitably benevolent and the Stepsisters are amusing and appropriately animated and I liked their names, Nellie(I think) and Melba sounds like they were paying tribute to the opera singer. The Prince is a little bland though, and the Stepmother annoyed me with her voice sounding like it was fresh out of doing Widow Twanky, which for this particular character is not really the right approach to me. Overall, decent but not great. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox</p>
