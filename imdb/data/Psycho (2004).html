<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, so I'll admit that this isn't the best movie ever made, but some of the other comments here are a touch harsh. Tokyo Psycho isn't supposed to be Ju-On or Ringu. This is a cool ass, low budget j-horror flick. And as a trashy, freak out, straight to video (or DVD, or whatever they call it these days) exploitation flick it totally works. I dug the washed out, stark appearance of the high-rise setting. Most horror films these days go for that post-Se7en look Â– filthy and dank and decaying, which looks cool, but has kind of become visual shorthand that tries to make up for a lack of actual scary stuff (see crap set piece films like Saw for example) and, more importantly, doesn't really jibe with reality. Most of us deal with over-lit, over-modern spaces. That sexy, 70's lower east side NYC look just doesn't exist anymore, and defiantly not in a place like Japan. Totally freaky stuff is secretly scarier when it happens in brightly lit spaces.This is totally a "throw in the DVD player when you're hanging out drinking and kicking it with a bunch of people" film. Not to be taken seriously, but still good, bloody low budget fun.</p>
