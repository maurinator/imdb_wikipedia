<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie many years ago, when I was in my teens, and then again when I was in my 20s. I haven't found it since. It was very moving to me at the time, partly because I really loved Delores Hart and Stephen Boyd. Alas, Steven Boyd died young, and never got the credit he was due as an actor while he was alive. And - alas again - Delores Hart's career was quite short because she left Hollywood at a young age and entered the convent.This is an unusual love story between a Dutch detective/police officer, and a young Jewish woman who is more or less stranded in Holland after the war. The detective is emotionally moved by the plight of this young women, and decides to help her get to Palestine. The rest of the movie revolves around their difficult and event-filled journey.Both Hart and Boyd are wonderful in their roles, and Hart's plight, and Boyd's emotional response and caring for her, are very moving. I believe that Boyd's character represents the European, non-Jews who went out of their way to help Jews during, and after WW II. But his feelings of caring for her, and his response to her particular story (I won't go into detail here about her tragic circumstances) go beyond guilt and just wanting to help. He is very drawn to her, and eventually, she is to him as well.Anyway, well worth seeing this emotional and atmospheric film. the film is from a book by the writer Jan de Hartog, and it is a very original, unusual story.</p>
