<h1>Police Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A string of business robberies have taken place in the city's Wilson Heights neighborhood, all done by the same three crooks. Captain Thaddeus Harris is no longer in the same precinct with a certain group of cops that he doesn't like. That's why Harris is so happy to be in the Wilson Heights precinct. But then The Mayor tells Harris that business in the city is plummeting because of the robberies. Since there appears to be a leak in Harris's precinct, the Governor has sent in a team to stop the Wilson Heights gang. Much to Harris's dismay, the team is led by Commandant Eric Lassard, so Harris knows who the team members are -- exactly the cops that he doesn't like. The team members are Nick Lassard, Moses Hightower, Eugene Tackleberry, Larvell Jones, Debbie Callahan, Laverne Hooks, and Douglas Fackler. The stakes are raised when Commandant Lassard is accused of being the mastermind behind the robberies, and the team must clear his name.</p>
<p>A gang is terrorizing citizens by robbing stores in the Wilson Heights district of town. Since a leak in the department is suspected, the Governor has chosen the officers from the police academy along with Captain Harris and Lt. Proctor to catch the criminals using old fashioned police work. When Commandant Lassard is indicted, the officers must bring the gang and Mr. Big to justice to clear him.</p>
<p>Those bumbling cadets take to the streets when three inept goons successfully orchestrate a metropolitan crime wave.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Finally, almost done with the Police Academy sequels, I finished the 6th movie in the series, Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, now this movie by no means is the worst movie ever, but it's the weaker of the movies and disappoints more than makes you laugh. With the earlier sequels, I've been surprised, with all the low ratings, I still was laughing at the movies, just because I think people were taking the movies too seriously or comparing too much to the original Police Academy. Now the last Police Academy may not have had Mahony, Steve Guttenberg's character, but it still made me laugh, but I miss the old gang, they were what made the sequels a lot of fun. I also once again missed Zed and Sweetchuck, certain characters just made these movies into fun comedies, but City Under Siege tries too hard.The class is back together to save the city from jewelery thieves, but the plot thickens when they find out that the leader of the gang is connected with the police. But of course Harris is after all the credit of making the bust on the jewelery thieves and taking the credit, even by mocking the old class that always pull something over their heads. But they find out that there is something deeper than just having the jewels, the thieves are going to own this town unless the police academy stops them.Police Academy 6: City Under Siege still delivers some really good laughs here and there, you always have to love the pranks the class pulls on Harris, G.W. Baily plays them off so well and makes the memorable. Also you have to love Bubba Smith who is the classic big guy you just don't wanna mess with. But as far as the sequels go, this was without a doubt the weaker, from what I understand Mission in Moscow is the worst, so I'm going to do my best to have faith and just hope the series ends with a bang. Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, I recommend it if you are looking to see the series, but as a comedy, it's just alright.3/10</p>
