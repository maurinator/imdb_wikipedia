<h1>Lolly-Madonna XXX (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two rustic families, headed by patriarchs Laban Feather and Pap Gutshall, are feuding. At first, it is comical, with just the sons of the two families playing tricks on each other. But soon the Feather boys decide to kidnap a girl. She turns out to be innocent bystander Roonie Gill, not the made-up girlfriend "Lolly Madonna." As events escalate, Zack Feather and Roonie fall in love and try to bring the others to their senses. Will Roonie discover Zack's dark secret, the reason for the painful feud between the two families which once were close friends?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a movie I, like many others, caught on late night TV. Being a long-time Jeff Bridges fan, I thought I would give this a whirl when it showed up on TBS back in the 80's. I was immediately transfixed by the atmosphere, the haunting music and most of all the casting. All of the characters were on target and I can't recall a movie with more "character" actors than this one. Scott Wilson, Randy Quaid, Ed Lauter, Keil Martin and 70's staple Paul Koslo all add to the richness of this flick. There were no real bad guys in my mind. Even Rod Steiger's psychotic yet tortured portrayal evoked sympathy. I was able to tape a showing about 15 years ago and still have the VHS. I am half afraid to watch it because if anything happened to it it's practically irreplaceable. With all the garbage being released on DVD these days I would love to see more quality pictures such as this being released.</p>
