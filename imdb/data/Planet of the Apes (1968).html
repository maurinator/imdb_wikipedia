<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical "bad" film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there.  Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven't even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I've seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can't dislike Planet of the Apes.</p>
