<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is cracking matin√©e fare. The cast is a big pool of Hollywood stalwarts as a fine supporting ensemble giving a thoughtful, adult vehicle to a typically thoughtful, adult lead from Harrison Ford. The drama is quite quiet and internal: don't be put off, as the cast handle it in a way decided non-European, investing characters with credible melodramatics and keeping everything entirely engaging. Some of the best courtroom set pieces I can remember.The plot is a detailed psychological thriller that one finds hard to keep absolutely on top of, yet Pakula keeps his eye on the top layer. The story unfolds steadily and inexorably. I watched it for a second time on DVD this morning and even knowing the ending and the twists that bring it about I couldn't see them flagged up at any point in Ford's performance.It's a film about the strengths and weaknesses of law - of civilisation of the pitfalls of trying to be moral (referred to as 'ideal'throughout). Above all it tries to address humanity and love which it does patiently, accurately and really very entertainingly 8/10</p>
