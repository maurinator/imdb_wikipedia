<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I must admit it has been a number of years since I had last seen See Spot Run, but I gotta say, it did make me laugh more than I thought it would.Sure, the movie's storyline may be cheesy, but it wasn't intended to be a deep, thought-provoking movie. It was a movie aimed at kids while also to be entertaining to their parents as well. With the hard-hitting issues that the world is facing, I think we could all agree that there is a need for more laughter. Without giving it away, the pet shop scene was especially funny.Although I thought the casting was good, the dog truly steals the show!</p>
