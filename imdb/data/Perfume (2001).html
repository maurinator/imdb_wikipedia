<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't think this was meant to be appealing or entertaining as a mainstream film. I think that as an offering to the mainstream as glimpse into the fashion industry, it hit it's mark. You were invited into that culture for a little while, listen, trail behind and watch, and left to draw your own conclusions about some of it. It had enough of a documentary-reality media feel to it to be very compelling, if you wished to participate.I hung out on the fringes of the fashion media industry for about 10 years when I lived in New York, and I can tell you that I had or heard some of those very same conversations - I could just about finish so many of their sentences. There really are the Janices who leave their families behind, etc., etc.I appreciate a film or a book that doesn't spoon-feed me information, or tell me how I need to feel. I like to be able to bring something of myself to it; that to me is intelligent interaction, and what art at every level is all about.</p>
