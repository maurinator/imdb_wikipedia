<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three young men live in the 50s somewhere in America. They've grown up and and now they plan to do a mock robbery of a bank. But in an other place, Florence plans a real bank robbery. The destination is the same...</p>
<p>Surrealistic tale of three teen boys practical joke gone astray as it becomes interwoven into a ex-con and his friend's real crime. There is an undercurrent of repressed gay attraction between and from the ex-cons. Throughout the movie there are several small character parts that are slightly out of kilter giving it additional surrealistic leanings.</p>
<p>Three young men decide to plan a mock kidnapping, but everything goes wrong because a real bank robbery was already planned by two other guys.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Fall Time was such an underrated film.  I cannot believe that this film got the critical mauling that it did.  Everything about it (save, maybe, for Sheryl Lee, who comes across as a bit hammy) is near perfect.  The director, Paul Warner should be commended for pulling off a film with a decent Mickey Rourke performance, and, as an actor myself.  If i ever get the chance to work with this director, it would be a dream come true.  I'm so glad to see that he's got another film in the pipeline.  Roll on it's release.</p>
