<h1>Fragment of Fear (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A young British author is plunged into a nightmare as he tries to solve his aunt's murder in Italy. When threats of violence, mysterious notes and deadly phone calls shatter his life, the police and his girlfriend doubt the story due to his past as a drug addict - even though his life is in danger.</p>
<p>One-time heroin addict Tim Brett has kicked the habit with the help of his rich, widowed aunt, and, having written a best-selling autobiography which has made him famous, is taking a holiday in Italy with the aunt prior to getting married to his girl-friend, Juliet. When, abruptly, the aunt is murdered, the Italian police are baffled and ascribe the killing to a casual thief; but Tim, returning to England, begins to pick up on strange clues which suggest a conspiracy. When his flat is broken into, he finds himself being harassed, rather than helped, by police officers - who turn out not to be genuine - and then followed by a mysterious gentleman who claims to represent British Intelligence. Was Tim's aunt part of an elaborate criminal conspiracy? Are the spies who claim to need Tim's help any more genuine than those bogus cops? Tim begins to wonder if he isn't losing his mind.</p>
<p>Reformed drug addict Tim Brett is holidaying in Italy with his aunt. When she is murdered, he tries to investigate, and soon his whole life is out of control.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Richard Sarafian is a decidedly underrated director. After finally seeing this, it's satisfying to report his VANISHING POINT was not a flash-in-the-pan. FRAGMENT...does not move at the same pace, nor does it get the viewer involved quite as quickly, but once you're about twenty minutes in, you're hooked until the end as Sarafian and screenwriter Dehn continually manipulate reality and our perceptions of it, along with lead character David Hemmings' perceptions of it. Really brilliant in the way it portrays a matter-of-fact unfolding of events that seem like a conventional, yet still insidious conspired-murder-by-blackmail-ring plot. But then we're constantly shown by the dialogue and actions of other characters that these events we've just witnessed may never have occurred. As an audience, we're constantly being shifted back and forth, momentarily convinced that recovering-addict-turned-successful-writer Hemmings is undergoing paranoid delusions, then the next moment convinced there really is a vast conspiracy against him and his investigation into his rich aunt's death. Disturbing and constantly involving, sucking the viewer in until the shocking conclusion. Unfortunately, the film's one real liability, which may in fact be the reason for some viewers' antipathy toward this film, is its totally inappropriate music score. Not only is the score mixed too loud on the soundtrack, it repeatedly draws attention to itself, often diffusing the effects Sarafian is trying to achieve. If only they had gotten someone like John Dankworth who could have composed a similar jazzy score but much more subtly and in keeping with the film's rhythms. Of course, even better would have been Ennio Morricone, someone who had already scored many Italian giallo thrillers that had attempted to play with reality in a similar way. Whomever hired Johnny Harris made a big mistake. His score is the one thing that keeps this from being a genuine little masterpiece.</p>
