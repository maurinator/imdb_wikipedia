<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It has been a while since I saw this film and remember thinking that this was a wasted cast. Despite the presence of Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Eric Sykes this movie isn't all that funny. Tommy Steele's permanent and inane grin was certainly not an asset to this movie. Either he was a sandwich short of the picnic or he knew that he was getting paid too much for this bad flick. I suspect that it was the latter.Directed by a name familiar from some of Norman Wisdom's comedies this movie treads uneasily between slap stick and musical without being successful as either. If for nothing else it is worth fans of the Carry Ons watching this just to see Sid James 'singing'. I guess in its day this movie was aimed at the sort of person that 10 years ago would have gone to see Spice World. Despite the desperate attempts to be a cheerful movie this really doesn't do much to lift the spirits.</p>
