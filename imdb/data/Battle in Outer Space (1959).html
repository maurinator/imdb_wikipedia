<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A truly great science fiction epic with plenty of futuristic hardware, alien invaders and cool spaceships. The best! It's finally available as of 2009 on DVD, although if you look hard you can find gray-market versions or bootlegs from Laserdiscs. The color is suitably lurid, the acting is done in earnest, the heroic Earth combatants do their best, the music is stirring -- it's really the PERFECT Japanese science fiction film! Why hasn't it been available before now on DVD?The whole Earth joins together to fight the "interstellar bandits" as one actor calls the threat. The spirit of the entire production is tremendously uplifting. It's a terrific picture that holds together even with the sometimes goofy Japanese translations. Absolutely the stuff of dreams for any little kid that loves old science fiction movies. A genuine treasure. Buy this one now while it's available!</p>
