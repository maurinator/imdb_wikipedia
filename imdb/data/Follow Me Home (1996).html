<h1>Follow Me Home (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Three muralists (one Chicano, one Black, one American Indian) and the socially-maladjusted cousin of the Chicano muralist set off on a road trip with the intent of painting their images on the White House. Along the way they meet a mysterious Black woman. Together, these four men and one woman encounter racism, sexism, internal conflicts, and finally redemption as they discover their common humanity and their internal ability to conquer the societal ills that effect them all.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Working with Peter and Ben on the Albuquerque premier was definitely a high light. Being a young woman of 16, I was honored to have met the Bratt boys and their mother ( wonderful force all in her own, now i understood where the Bratt boys got their charisma and charm). The movie itself inspired me to keep writing, and follow my dreams. It was absolutely wonderful being able to partake in such a life altering event. I wish that I still had my memorabilia from the promotions, as they would now be priceless. The movie was beautifully written, directed and produced. Phenomenal! I would definitely want to own this in my DVD collection to show my son when he gets older.</p>
