<h1>Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Producer Walter Wanger, who had just been released from a prison term after shooting a man he believed was having an affair with his wife, wanted to make a film about the appalling conditions he saw while he was incarcerated. He got together with director Don Siegel and they came up with this film, in which several prison inmates, to protest brutal guards, substandard food, overcrowding and barely livable conditions, stage an uprising, in which most of the inmates join, and take several guards hostage. Negotiations between the inmates and prison officials are stymied, however, by politicians interfering with the prison administration, and by dissension and infighting in the inmates' own ranks.</p>
<p>Fed up with the inhumane prison living conditions, a general prison riot breaks out, leading to hostage-taking, a stand-off with the guards and eventual negotiations with the prison administration officials.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In one way - 1954's "Riot In Cell Block 11" was kind of like watching a slice of Film Noir that goes to prison with no chance of parole - (Well, sort of) - Minus, of course, the femme fatale angle.As far as prison pictures go - This gritty, low-budget, tough-guy tale (though mighty tame by today's standards) still packed a substantial wallop even without a non-stop barrage of profanity and bloodshed.Filmed (in b&w) on location at Folsom State Prison, California - This particular picture is notable for being one of the first in its genre to have the disgruntled convicts manipulate the media in order to make their grievances about prison conditions known to the public.Yes. This picture featured typical, prison stereotypes. And, yes, it contained its fair share of unintentional humour, as well - But, all the same - (With its fast-paced, 80-minute running time) - It was still well-worth a view."Riot In Cell Block 11" (which was produced on a $300,000 budget) was directed by Don Siegel, who would later go on to direct Clint Eastwood in 1971's Dirty Harry.</p>
