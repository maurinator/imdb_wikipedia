<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this flick when I was quite young ... around 1960 or 61. It made such a lasting impression on me that I would love to have the movie in video. I recall crying after the movie ended, because it was so beautiful. It started me on a lifetime of appreciation of all things magical and mystical. I can't find it anywhere. Is it available? Anywhere?</p>
