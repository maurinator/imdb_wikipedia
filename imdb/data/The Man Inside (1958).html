<h1>The Man Inside (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An English bookkeeper (Nigel Patrick) who works for a jeweler steals a priceless jewel, and kills a man in the process. He flees to the continent and embarks on the life of his dreams; spending lavishly and pursuing women (including Anita Ekberg). A detective (Jack Palance) tracking him soon discovers that he's not the only one looking for him and begins to suspect there's more to the case than just an ordinary jewel theft.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a modest British adventure thriller which was hoped would hit the world market at a time when this kind of picture was in vogue. A jewellers book keeper steals a priceless diamond and is trailed by various factions half across Europe. Interesting vehicle for Anthony Newley who was given a more meatier role than his usual light musical comedy roles as taxi driver Ernesto. The all star cast includes the very British Nigel Patrick, Sid James (before his Carry On days), and a guest appearance by Donald Pleasence. Palance and Ekberg gave this British movie the American market interest. Richard Bennett's brilliant theme is akin to The Harry Lime Theme from The Third Man. Written by John Gilling (later of Hammer film fame). A rare movie, not released on video nor seen on TV for many years. Paul Goodhead - President Anthony Newley Society Worldwide.</p>
