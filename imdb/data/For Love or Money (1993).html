<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Doug is a young man who works all day as a concierge at a luxurious hotel, saving money to make his own business. Unfortunately, when he finds the financial supporter he needs, he discovers that his "saviour" is having an affair with the woman he loves! Now, he must choose between money and love...</p>
<p>Doug Ireland is the concierge of a ritzy hotel in New York. He does what he has to to satisfy the hotel's guests, by getting them what they need; like jewelry, candy mints, and theatre tickets. He also tries to keep the manager from terminating Milton, the bellhop, who was been working at the hotel for more than half a century, who likes to think that the spirit of the hotel's founder is still around. Doug wants to open his own hotel on Roosevelt Island. Now he has saved every cent he could to get an option on an old hotel. Now he has a matter of weeks to develop the hotel or else he will lose it. But to do it he needs at least 3 million dollars and his best chance to get it is Christian Hanover. While Hanover considers Doug's proposal, he asks him to "take care" of his girlfriend, Andy, a girl whom Doug has the hots for but is constantly turned down when he asks her out, cause she doesn't want to be two timing her boyfriend, Hanover. Now Hanover is married but says that "he will divorce his wife and marry her". Doug doesn't exactly believe him but thinks that his hotel is more important and Andy can make her own decisions. But the more Doug spends with Andy, Doug is starting to wonder what is important.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Some people have suggested that Fox's character in this movie isjust Alex P. Keaton all over again.  I think they missed the point. Alex was in love with money.  Doug is not as materialistic; hedoesn't desire money for its own sake, but views it as a tool thatwill help him realize his dream.  Alex was self-centered.  Dougcares about other people.  He is successful because he canempathize with people and give them what they need.  He is veryinspiring.                    This movie is described as a comedy, but I didn't find it veryfunny; I cared about the characters too much to laugh at them.</p>
