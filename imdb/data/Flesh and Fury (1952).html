<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>a young Tony Curtis. boxing. and Jan Sterling in a role as puzzle of shadows. lovely for story, far to be original, it is a seductive movie about vulnerabilities, courage and love. about choices and changes. and that fact does it seductive. not great or nice but interesting. like each easy story who reminds the fundamental things in wise manner. a film who preserves its romanticism as basic tool for create a large audience. and a touching social message about the need of help for the other. so, a mixture of romance and social cause. nothing complicated, good occasion for rediscover Tony Curtis at his first steps in a lead role. and a beautiful atmosphere. so, a nice show. touching, seductive and with an useful moral lesson.</p>
