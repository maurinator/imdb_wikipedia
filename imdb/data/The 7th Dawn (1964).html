<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree with most posts. I think this was an underrated film, surprisingly hard to find. It was quite critical of the British elements of counter terrorism. It seemed a little simplistic, but it told a story not usually found in most movies. I think that it was a good, balanced viewpoint of colonialism, terrorism as well as romance. This would be an intriguing remake, if today's times were a little different. Today's culture is far into the anti-terrorist mode to understand the psychology of insurgency. Vietnam was much more complex, with the S.Vietnamese bureaucracy betraying themselves and China masterminding the NVA for its own purposes. William Holden played the naive, if somewhat self-important voice of reason. He played the angle from his side, and was critical of the British viewpoint. The "loyalty" aspect was quite intriguing and prevalent throughout most of the film, and he distinguished that element again in the Wild Bunch. This was a pretty good movie.</p>
