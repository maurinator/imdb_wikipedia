<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Dharam Veer is a period costume drama set in the midieval periods shot in grand colourful palaces and forts. While the storyline and screenplay are contemporary, its the special effects and poorly edited action sequences that make the film look a bit dated. The film is based on the "lost and found" formula, a specialty of its director, Mr. Manmohan Desai. When the family astrologer predicts to the brother of the queen of a kingdom that his eldest nephew (sisters son) will be responsible for his untimely death, the uncle tries to eliminate him on the day he is born. While the scheming uncle believes that his nephew is dead, all that he has unknowingly managed to do is that he has separated the child from his family. The prince is brought up at a poor blacksmith's house in an environment of contrast with the life of a palace. However, as luck would have it, the poor prince emerges to be the best friend of his younger brother from the palaces in a kingdom which believes that rich and poor are all alike. They eventually reunite as brothers to get rid of their scheming uncle who had designs for his son to be the crowned king. Various parallel well knit side tracks enhance the pace of the film.All in all, thoroughly entertaining fare with nice music, beautiful backdrops, gorgeous stars (zeenat aman and dharmendra are just fab!), grand festivities, moderate emotions and hilarious comedy scenes make it a must watch!</p>
