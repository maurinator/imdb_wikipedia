<h1>Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Thrilled by a performance she sees at a fair, Sonora (Gabrielle Anwar) tries to land a spot as a daredevil who rides horses off of high dives. With the help of Al Carver (Michael Schoeffling), whose father runs the show, Sonora works toward her goal. An injury to star rider Marie (Kathleen York) paves her way, and Sonora finds herself on the diving platform. Her life looks complete now that she and Al are in love, but Sonora is about to be thrust into a very trying.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I do not know how many times I watched this movie. It enjoyable every time I see it. Gabrielle Anwar who plays Sonora a runaway is desperately to make her dreams true as a driving girl. A lesson worth learn about in the film. All the performances are great. A film worth the celluloid it printed.</p>
