<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In Russian the bodies of children begin to get uncovered to reveal what appears to be a Russian serial killer.  Due to the nature of the case it is given to a young forensics expert who will be blamed should the case fail. Over 8 years Burakov hunts the killer using methods that are seen as unusual at best and fighting with the internal politics that surround him.  This is based on a true story.HBO TV movies are often a mixed bunch  but I had heard good things about this.  The story is immediately engaging as young faces are uncovered beneath shallow soil graves to horrible effect.  The fact that it at heart, a true story makes it all the more compelling.  The story mixes not only the hunt for this man but also the effect on the perserving Burakov.  We see his desperation and the pressure he is under to catch the killer, in particular the political forces who do little to help him in his job.  The focus on Burakov makes it more interesting as the human side is well done.The facts of the case make the man hunt less interesting  however the political action is interesting.  For example members of the communist party were not looked at and homosexuals in particular were targeted  often as a fall back method.  It's one of the best repeated shots in the film where Burakov has to several time accompay a group of men to kick in doors and arrest homosexuals  he simply stays outside with a resigned look on his face.Rea is excellent as Burakov and brings the man to life  I'm not sure how true to fact his portrayal is, but you get the impression of a man pushed to his limits by all around him.  Sutherland is also very good for different reasons  he has the same passion but it is beneath a smooth political operator.  Ackland is good but is really only there to make noise.  Von Sydow is good despite his short screen time.Overall this uses human interest to drive the film, rather than gore or violence.  This is well made and manages to be interesting and involving despite not being flashy.</p>
