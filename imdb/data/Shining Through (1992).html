<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>What a truly gripping film and storyline!! Melanie Griffith played her role as a spy beautifully, and Michael Douglas added his own special touch to the film.The late John Gielgud and Joely Richardson were also stars who made the film that little bit more eye catching!! In some parts it was emotional too, showing how Germany was like in the 1940's era. A very moving and successful film, which deserved every bit of its 10/10!!</p>
