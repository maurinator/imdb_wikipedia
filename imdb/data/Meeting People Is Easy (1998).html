<h1>Meeting People Is Easy (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An entertaining "rockumentary" about Radiohead that shows some of the tedium of being a rock star, as well as some of the fun stuff.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having simply looked at the box the video came in, I was addicted.  Such a simple box - understated, yet beautiful.  This is a film that can be judged by its cover.  It didn't take long before I was just as addicted to the film as I was the box.The choice thing about the film is that you can watch it no matter what your state of mind.  If you feel like doing something totally passive, it's comforting just to hear Radiohead noises in the background.  On the other hand, you could take a fabulous journey on the emotional rollercoaster of the touring band.Mr Gee has done a fantastic job in fitting everything together so well. In many ways, it's like a Radiohead song -  a complex web of goodness where you'll always find something new.If for no other reason, watch it to see Richard Kingsmill on TV.   I love The King, you love The King, everyone loves The King.The King loves Radiohead.  It is The King's love of Radiohead that makes The King so ace.If only the chaps hadn't given up on Big Boots...Watch MPIE NOW!</p>
