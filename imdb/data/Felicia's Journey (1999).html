<h1>Felicia's Journey (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A lonely middle-aged catering manager spends all of his time studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef. Meanwhile, a young woman is making her way from Ireland to find her boyfriend, who moved to England to get a job in a lawnmower factory. On arrival, she makes an early contact with the caterer, who recommends a boarding room to her. Slowly, it is revealed that the caterer has in fact befriended and subsequently abused more than a dozen young women. He, of course, now sets his sights on this woman. Much of the story is told in flashbacks, revealing how each of the characters grew to the point where they now find themselves. However, the drama of the character interaction is more important to director, Atom Egoyan, than the potential horror of the situation.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film reminded me a lot of PEEPING TOM. Like Mark Lewis, the protagonist of the  Michael Powell classic, Bob Hoskins' character was subject to torment from a parent's  profession (The Psychologist father in PEEPING TOM, the cooking show mother in this  film) and has video records of his crimes (Here, videotape). Both even end up  committing suicide at the end, though PEEPING TOM's end was a bit more graphic. Egoyan even makes a little nod to the other master of suspense, with the scene of  Hoskins bringing the drugged drink up the stairs, a scene that brings to mind  Hitchcock's SUSPICION. A great homage to the British thriller.</p>
