<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was Guru Dutt's second movie, after Dev Anand's production "Baazi". Guru Dutt was sort of finding his bearings through commercially successful movies. And after "Baazi", this was the second film in which Dev Anand also came through as a confident star/actor, with a style uniquely his own. Geeta Bali, the most gifted actress of the Indian screen ever, gave a scintillating performance. But what stood out most was the musical score of the film. Till date, the sweetness of the melodious "Yeh raat yeh chandni phir kahan, sun ja dil ki dastaan", sung by the heavenly voices Hemant Kumar has not been equalled by any song of this type, composed by any music composure. Most other songs were based on the Goan folk music, probably first time used by a music director.</p>
