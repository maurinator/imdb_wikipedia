<h1>The Getaway (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Doc McCoy is put in prison because his partners chickened out and flew off without him after exchanging a prisoner with a lot of money. Doc knows Jack Benyon, a rich "business"-man, is up to something big, so he tells his wife (Carol McCoy) to tell him that he's for sale if Benyon can get him out of prison. Benyon pulls some strings and Doc McCoy is released again. Unfortunately he has to cooperate with the same person that got him to prison.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let me start by saying that I have not seen the original, 1972 version of "The Getaway". As a result, this critique for the 1994 version will concentrate solely on the impressions it left me after having viewed it, without any references and comparisons with the original one."The Getaway" is a typical action film, in which the two main heroes, Doc McCoy (Baldwin), and his sexy wife, Carol (Basinger), are being double-crossed by their gang mates; although it involves several smaller sub-plots, the movie is mainly showing us the couple being on the run, as they are trying to flee from successive unpleasant situations.The idea of the storyline does not sound very novel, and indeed it is not. And yet, although the movie has a "have-seen-it-several-times-before" taste, it does work and it is quite enjoyable.Donaldson's direction keeps the story rolling fast, and yet successfully avoiding to overdo the action scenes. As far as the acting is concerned, the duo does a fair job, with Bassinger proving us that she has also some substance apart from her splendid looks; I liked also Madsen in his role as the archetypal bad guy, while Woods has a small but well-acted appearance as the rich mobster.To sum this up, "The Getaway" may not be a masterpiece, yet it offers two entertaining hours. 6/10.</p>
