<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This was Navketan's second production, after "Afsar". Dev Anand,  the Producer, gave chance to Guru Dutt to make his directorial debut. The story of an urban unemployed youth taking to crime because of circumstances, has excellent performance from Geeta Bali and equally unforgettable music by S. D. Burman, who experimented with the Ghazal format, in its orchestration, for the first time with the song "Tadbeer se bigdi hui taqdeer bana le". With this film Dev Anand picked up his style, which were to keep him on top, alongwith Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor, for decades to come.</p>
