<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film could have been something very interesting, but comes off worse than a daytime soap opera. It has a noir style, set in the the California Redwoods, but none of the characters are sympathetic, and Ned Beatty's over-acting drives the nail in the coffin of unsufferability. It has your typical noir plot, but somehow you end up laughing at the characters hoping they'll die soon. The poetic thread and imagery hints that there could have been something really unusual in the concept, but the execution makes it dreadful. Doubtful if you'll even have a chance to see this on late night cable...</p>
