<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw "Victim of Love" under the more provocative title "Raw Heat". The original title may be bland, but it's also more accurate, as the director of this erotic thriller goes out of his way not to show "too much" flesh in the erotic scenes. On the other hand, the film is directed with an unusual sensitivity towards the female characters, and it will probably appeal more to women. The "did-he-or-didn't-he?" story does keep you guessing to the last minute (and beyond!), and most of the credit for that has to go to the skill of the actors: Pierce Brosnan as the mysterious, seductive, possibly murderous professor, Jobeth Wiliams as the "mature" but still very attractive psychiatrist who's longing for love, and Virginia Madsen as her fragile, possibly psychotic patient. They all match their roles perfectly. (**1/2)</p>
