<h1>At Sword's Point (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>France, 1648: Richelieu and Louis XIII are dead, the new king is a minor, and the Duc de Lavalle is in virtually open rebellion, scheming to seize power. As a last resort, Queen Anne summons the heirs of the original Musketeers to her aid...including Claire, daughter of Athos, who when she chooses can miraculously pass as a boy, and wields as fine a sword as any. All their skills will be needed for a battle against increasing odds. One for all and all for one!</p>
<p>In 1648 France, it's the sons (and daughter) of the Three Musketeers to the rescue!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is truly an excellent swashbuckling adventure starring Muareen O'Hara and Cornel Wilde. There are lots of impressive sword fights. Maureen o'Hara is gorgeous funny and fights excellently with a sword. As well as sword fights there is lots of humour and wit in the film. The film centres around the sons and daughter of the musketeers. They must assist queen Anne in her fight against Lavalle.I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the three musketeers from 1948 film starring Gene Kelly and Lana Turner. Heaps of fun 10/10 glad they are releasing this on warner archives DVD.Chris</p>
