<h1>With Six You Get Eggroll (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Abby McClure, a widow with three sons, and Jake Iverson, a widower with a teen-age daughter, get fixed up. They start dating and decide to get married. They're not prepared for the hostile reactions from their children, especially Jake's daughter Stacy, who wants to be the woman of the house, and Abby's oldest son Flip, who hates Jake.</p>
<p>Since the death of her husband, Abby McClure has had to be mother, father and breadwinner - taking over operation of the family lumber store business - to her three sons. Her sister, Maxine Scott, has tried to be matchmaker for Abby, much to her exasperation as Abby sees men eligible to her as those she would rather not associate. Abby changes her mind when Maxine reminds her of a casual acquaintance, widowed chemical engineer Jake Iverson, who she has not seen or thought about in six or seven years from before her husband's death. Based on some unfortunate situations and some misunderstandings, Abby and Jake's new-found relationship does not start off well. When a serious courtship does begin, their respective children - most specifically Abby's oldest, late teen Flip McClure, and Jake's only offspring, late teen Stacey Iverson - are their biggest obstacles as Flip and Stacey don't want their role of male and female head of their respective household replaced. When Abby and Jake eventually get married, one other pressure is how they will live while both their too small houses wait to be sold. Can their marriage survive all these issues?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I absolutely love this movie.  People have commented that Doris Day's later movies were not as good as the ones from the early '60s, but I disagree. The storyline here is very engaging, and the characters are superb.  I totally lose myself in this movie when I watch it, and I laugh out loud every time.  It is fun to follow the timeline of the movie... if you analyze it the entire thing takes place over about 5 months.  It begins in June (with Flip and Stacey's graduation), and ends around Halloween (hence the brief appearnces of the Halloween masks).  The supporting cast is terrific too, some great old faces that everyone will recognize.  If you love the classic comedies of Doris Day, I heartily recommend this one.</p>
