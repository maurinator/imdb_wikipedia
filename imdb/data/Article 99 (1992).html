<h1>Article 99 (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of doctors in a veteran's hospital must contend with their hopeless situation: too many patients and not enough beds. The main cause of their problems is bureaucratic belt-tightening by the hospital administrators. The doctors are determined to give the best service they can, even if that means defying the orders of management and performing unauthorized operations.</p>
<p>Un gruppo di medici, un pò eroi e un pò incoscienti, rischia carriera e futuro per cercare di curare (operando senza permesso e trafugando i mezzi tecnici dell'ospedale stesso) i reduci di guerra ricoverati in un ospedale nord-Americano, lottando contro la burocrazia governativa e le mire carrieristiche del direttore amministrativo dell'ospedale. Alla fine, dopo una "rivolta" di medici, infermieri e degenti, il direttore viene rimosso. Ma la burocrazia rimane in agguato!</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was made in 1992 but i only heard about it when i saw that it was on FX channel last night (22 Feb 2005). Ray Liotta was a goody which i'd never seen before, and he was great. The story is about low paid doctors trying their best to provide war veterans a complete medical service of treatment (including psychiatric) and operations. The hospital is overcrowded, understaffed,underfunded and under-supplied of medical provisions. The film takes us through the trials and tribulations of the underhanded tricks they pull to get provisions and perform operations on the needy Vets. The uncaring chief Administrator, wants the hospital run by the book, which does not include certain types of treatment and operations. Indeed, it seems like he doesn't think there should be patients in his hospital at all! so of course, they have the expected run-ins with him. Plenty offamous faces as patients, a little bit of romance, humour in the right places and an exciting climax, complete this great drama - well worth watching. I'll be getting the video i think!</p>
