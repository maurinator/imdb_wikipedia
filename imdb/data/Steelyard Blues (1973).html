<h1>Steelyard Blues (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of misfits decide to leave for a place that they can all be free. Their mode of transportation is a PBY flying boat. The only problem is that the PBY needs a lot of work and they will need jobs to pay for the parts. When they find that they have only 10 days before the PBY is sold for scrap, they decide on borrowing the parts for their trip.</p>
<p>Drifter Veldini frequently finds himself in jail for various misdemeanours, much to the despair of his upright lawyer brother Frank, who is aiming for public office. Trying to get away from Frank's good intentions, Veldini ends up out of town with his other brother, some school chums, and his hooker girlfriend, trying to restore a flying boat to an airworthy state, whatever it takes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"I dunno nothing about climbing... except onto broads and motorcycles." --Peter Boyle replies to Donald Sutherland in a Brando voice when asked to climb into someplace to steal something."A '50 Studie!" --Donald Sutherland exclaims when he sees a 1950 Studebaker at a demolition derby, the only model he had yet to crash into in his derby driving days before prison.Most, if not all, of the members of the comedy group The Committee appear in the movie and there's a great bit that defies description involving Hessman, his henchman, a sort of movie-prop housefront with someone pretending to be an out-of-control guard dog barking at the window while one of the others tries to hold him back.I think Sutherland said in a Playboy interview that it was during the filming of this movie that Jane Fonda raised his consciousness.Sigh, I never would have seen most of my favorite movies if it weren't for revival houses that brought this and other classic or off-beat movies back from time to time. Sadly, most of those theaters are long gone too these days.</p>
