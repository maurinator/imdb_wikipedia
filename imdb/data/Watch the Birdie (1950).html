<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Red Skelton takes a leaf out of Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers' book and plays three generations in Watch The Birdie. Red plays the grandfather, father, and son who own a camera shop.During the course of the film Red comes to the attention of the beautiful Arlene Dahl who has inherited a construction company from her father. The last project her father was on is a site that rival construction company owner Leon Ames wants very badly and is not above chicanery to get it.The other woman in Red's life is Ann Miller who while she doesn't dance a step uses that figure to full advantage. Jane Russell had nothing on Miller for being a full figure gal. Miller is a beauty contest winner and her character is drawn from the one who chased Jules Munshin in On The Town.There's a very funny sequence with Red and Dick Wessel as the two try to change clothes in a small dressing room with Skelton having a cold and sneezing all over the place. The climax chase scene with the bad guys chasing Skelton and Dahl is also well staged.Fans of Red Skelton will like Watch The Birdie.</p>
