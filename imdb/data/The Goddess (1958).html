<h1>The Goddess (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Loosely based on the life of Marilyn Monroe, the story of a young woman destined from childhood on to be adored by millions but unhappy in her own life. Patty Duke plays Emily Ann Faulkner as a young, friendless, fatherless rural southern girl whose mother is indifferent to her. As a teenager, Emily Ann, played by Kim Stanley, remains a loner but with one small exception - boys dote on her, drawn by her beauty and her powerful aura of feminine sexuality. Emily Ann marries young but leaves her first husband when she meets young prizefighter Dutch Seymour (Lloyd Bridges). She becomes an actress and her star rises rapidly until she hits the heights of fame - and the depths of anguish.</p>
<p>Emily Ann Faulkner grew up unloved by her self-absorbed party-loving mother, who openly stated that they would have given up Emily Ann if given the chance. Craving adoration, Emily Ann always knew she wanted to be an actress - really, a movie star - but ends up being a lonely child. Even in her teen-aged years, Emily Ann, while trying to attract the attention of boys, doesn't know how to react when they get too close to her overtly sexual come-ons. Through two marriages which produced a daughter, Emily Ann still drives those around her away by not knowing how to deal with intimacy. Emily Ann eventually does get her wish of being a world renowned Hollywood movie star, renamed Rita Shawn. With her fame comes the adoration - the idolization - she has always craved. But will this goddess status fulfill her as a person?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How some people can view THE GODDESS in the aftermath of Anna Nicole Smith's tragedy is beyond me. The parallels, not only between Smith but also Marilyn (and Jayne Mansfield) are astonishing! The film is utterly moving and, contrary to other reviews, inspires much empathy for the main character!The film has a deep and profound insight into the mind of those famous starlets--and the rest of us, as well. This is NOT a Hollywood story; nor is it even the story of a famous woman. It is about suffering and insecurity. From a very early age, the girl is alone. Her mother doesn't want her and the men in her life are only looking for sex. She reaches out desperately for love, and yet she herself (possibly because she has been hurt so many times) is unable to give it back. By the end of the film, she is completely alone; not able to give or receive love from others, including her daughter, and there is that great line by her first husband: "Life is unbearable if you don't love something." Her secretary tells him, "She will go on making pictures, because that is all she can do."Hollywood. The dream factory. Places where lonely people go seeking fame--that great idea of being loved by everyone. Only it doesn't solve anything. Not for Joan. Not for Marilyn. Not for Anna.</p>
