<p>At the Carnegie Deli in New York City, a group of comics are kvetching about their common professional lives. One of the more interesting topics of conversation centers on theatrical manager (aka talent agent) Danny Rose, who represents those who can't get better agents but who has always been committed to his clients. They talk most specifically about a rumored incident that took place approximately ten years ago, when Danny's most famous client was washed-up lounge singer Lou Canova, who had some minor fame in the 1950s and who was trying to make a comeback during an era when lounge singers were mostly seen as being hack performers. Despite being married with children, Lou was having an affair with brash blonde Tina Vitale, who Lou wanted at one of his performances. As such, Danny agreed to be a beard in being Tina's date. What Danny did not know was that Tina had casual mob ties, including her ex-husband being entrenched within the organization. Through no fault of Danny's own besides protecting his client Lou, Danny became the target of the mob.</p>
<p>Danny Rose (played by Woody Allen) is a theatrical agent. He has a wide and often odd assortment of clients but will do anything for them. One of his clients, Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte) - a washed up crooner from the 50s who is undergoing a resurgence, asks Danny to accompany his mistress, Tina (Mia Farrow), to one of his concerts - her presence helps him perform. Danny naturally obliges. However, Tina is also seeing a mob boss and when Danny is seen with her, the mob boss assumes Tina is two-timing him with Danny. This results in Danny and Tina being hunted by the mob. Adventures and hilarity ensue.</p>
<p>In his attempts to reconcile a lounge singer with his mistress, a hapless talent agent is mistaken as her lover by a jealous gangster.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the most commonly leveled criticisms against Woody Allen is that he has no range as an actor or is that he simply plays the same stammering intellectual in all of his films. Nothing could be further from the truth and this film is testament to this fact.This beautifully shot film is concerned with theatrical agent, Danny Rose, a man who takes on blind xylophone players and one legged tap dancers. Terrible acts and yet Rose believes in every single one of them, no matter how badly they are doing. His big break comes with the public's newfound appetite for nostalgia, which brings egomaniac and alcoholic crooner, Lou Canova back into the public eye.Canova flourishes and is set to make his comeback complete when he requires Rose to bring his mistress, Tina to the concert. Various complications and highjinks ensure that this is no easy task.This is the comedy of the situation and the movie relies on this farce for its comic effect. However, what separates this from other sub-standard films is the characterisation that Allen brings to Rose. At first glance Rose is a loser, whose acts leave him as soon as they get anywhere. But the belief he has in his charges and the commitment he is prepared to put into them allows a great deal of empathy for him. Allen plays it brilliantly, allowing just the right amount of pathos and charm.A splendid movie, full of the typical Allen one liners and with one very very funny shoot out scene with helium.</p>
