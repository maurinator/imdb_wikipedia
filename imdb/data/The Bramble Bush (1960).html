<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A handsome and successful young doctor returns to his home town in New England to see his dying friend for one last time. However, his friend wants to die because he is suffering so much from his illness, and he manages to convince the doctor to commit euthanasia (a mercy killing) on him. Haunted by what he has done, and troubled further still by other dark secrets from his past, the doctor seeks comfort in the arms of several of the town's lustful women. This leads to even more complications in his life...</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you have the classical training that Richard Burton had you can make some of the worst tripe sound as profound as the classics. But even he had trouble with The Bramble Bush which is a third class ripoff of Peyton Place.Burton is cast as a doctor in The Bramble Bush gone back to his Peyton Place like New England town on a consultation. A good friend from childhood, Tom Drake, is dying of incurable Hodgkin's Disease and he'd like for Burton to put an end to him in a humane manner. So would Drake's wife Barbara Rush so she can move on. Burton helps with her problem as well.And he's also helping nurse Angie Dickinson with her situation as well. Angie's involved with bottom feeding lawyer Jack Carson and later on bottom of the ocean feeding city editor Henry Jones learns about the two of them. Angie would much prefer Burton and Burton obliges as best he can.James Dunn's character is totally unexplained. Burton has a visceral hatred for him because he found him in bed with his mother back in the day as a kid. But why Dunn is trying to push himself in Burton's company is totally up in the air. Dunn does a good job as an alcoholic, sad to say in real life as well. What might have been an interesting film on euthanasia instead becomes a trashy soap opera in The Bramble Bush. A whole cast of some really good players is wasted here.</p>
