<h1>Funny Games (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two seemingly well-educated young men, who call each other Paul and Peter among other names, approach a family on vacation. They are, apparently, friends of the neighbors, and, at the beginning, their true intentions are not known, but soon, the family is imprisoned and tortured in its own house violently, which the viewers are forced mostly to imagine and to share a certain complicity with the criminals. It might be some kind of game with the lives of husband, wife, son, and dog, but why are they doing it?</p>
<p>In this deconstruction of the way violence is portrayed in the media, a family settles into its vacation home, which happens to be the next stop for a pair of young, articulate, white-gloved serial killers on an excursion through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Georg and Anna, and their son Georgie, are traveling to their lakeside summer home. Upon arrival, Georg and Georgie head off to the lake for sailing while Anna prepares dinner in the kitchen. The serenity is shattered by a young man named Peter, who knocks at the door asking to borrow some eggs. The unwanted visitor is joined by Paul, a brash, arrogant young man. It soon becomes clear the pair has no intention of leaving. When Georg returns and tries to throw them out, physical violence erupts, and the family is held captive. What ensues are highly disturbing and violent games that are initiated by Paul and Peter with Georg, Anna, and Georgie as the unwilling participants.</p>
<p>Two violent young men take a mother, father, and son hostage in their vacation cabin and force them to play sadistic "games" with one another for their own amusement.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Heavy-handed (as is typical of (most) Germanic cinema), attemptedly clever (I cringed - only out of embarrassment for Haneke - every time someone would turn 'metacinematic' & talk to/wink at the camera), monotonously scripted, clichedly shot. It's 'shocking' (on the DVD backcover), but it's not shocking enough (self-censored); it's 'terrifying', but actually it's interminably dull & dumb; it's not radical enough (even by late 90s standards), and it's too insincere. Haneke seems interested in *telling* what the audience should see, how they ought to feel - perhaps then 'lectures' would be a better word for it than 'games'.Misery, Death & the Maiden, Hard Candy (just to name a few in this 'genre') are infinitely superior.</p>
