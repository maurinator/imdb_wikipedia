<h1>Nagin (1954)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After one male from their tribe is injured, angered Ragis decide to confront the rival snake-charming tribe of Nagis. Angered by this, Mala, the daughter of Sardar Bhopal, decides to kill the son, Sanatan, of the Ragi's Sardar - but she ends up being rescued by him and both fall in love - much to the chagrin of her father who wants her to wed Kaan Khajur Prabir - and forbids her to even see Sanatan. The latter sneaks into their tribe to meet her and on one such occasion is caught, severely beaten and left for dead. The Ragis find him, bring him back home, and confront the Nagis. Afraid that his daughter may elope with Sanatan, Bhopal and Prabir take her to the city where they hope to compel her to marry the latter. Sanatan follows and through his Been (flute) manages to locate Mala - but their reunion may never materialize - as Bhopal has prepared an elaborate plan to do away with Sanatan once and for all - and aiding him wholeheartedly is not only Prabir but also a venomous snake.</p>
<p>Lovers from two warring snake-charming tribes face life-threatening challenges.</p>
