<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Involuntarily-retired Colonel Hyde recruits seven other dissatisfied ex-servicemen for a special project. Each of the men has a skeleton in the cupboard, is short of money, and is a service-trained expert in his field. The job is a bank robbery, and military discipline and planning are imposed by Hyde and second-in-command Race on the team, although civilian irritations do start getting in the way.</p>
<p>Forced into early retirement after 25 years of army service, Lt. Col. Hyde recruits 7 other officers to stage a dating bank robbery. The 7 former officers were all forced out of army for indiscretions - some quite serious - but all have a specialty that Hyde needs to make the robbery a success. Before robbing the bank itself however, they stage a number of raids to get the weapons and trucks they need and all go off without a hitch. The robbery is planned with military precision and it too goes as planned - except for one simple error on their part.</p>
<p>A disgruntled veteran recruits a group of disgraced colleagues to perform a bank robbery with military precision.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An enjoyable effort in the Ealing vein, more specifically in the black comic vein of "Kind Hearts and Coronets" or "The Naked Truth", with fairly upper-class individuals gleefully straying from the straight and narrow. It is a mark of the film's whimsical success that one is made to sympathise with what is basically a gang of upper-class soldiers resorting to criminality. The wit, camaraderie and very subtle pathos of the ex-soldiers is very well worked - adrift as they are in peacetime, the planned heist provides some scope for their talents.Most of the actors make their mark in some way - Roger Livesey, Nigel Patrick and particularly Jack Hawkins, are wonderful. Robert Coote is wonderfully spot-on in his late appearance as Brigadier Bunny Warren.The script is finely crafted and while not up to the standard of "Kind Hearts...", this is quite a fine little film, always mildly winning in some way throughout its duration. Rating:- ****/*****</p>
