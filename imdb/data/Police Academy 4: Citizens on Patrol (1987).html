<h1>Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A new batch of recruits arrives at Police Academy, this time a group of civilian volunteers who have joined Commandant Lassard's new Citizens on Patrol program. Although the community relations project has strong governmental support, a disgusted Captain Harris is determined to see it fail.</p>
<p>Commandant Eric Lassard decides that the police force is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side-by-side with officers in a program called "Citizens On Patrol" (COP). Carey Mahoney and his friends Moses Hightower, Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, Laverne Hooks, and Debbie Callahan are in charge of training the civilians. The civilians include Tommy "House" Conklin, Lois Feldman, Kyle, and Arnie. Captain Thaddeus Harris wants to take over Lassard's job, and that's why Harris is determined to see the COP program fail. But it's Harris and his right hand man Proctor who mess up by unintentionally allowing every inmate at the precinct 19 jail to escape.</p>
<p>The misfit Police Academy (1984) graduates now are assigned to train a group of civilian volunteers to fight crime once again plaguing the streets.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a hard Academy movie to define. The humour is generally more smutty, keeping up the standards of the original, yet it also has awful gags about people slipping on skateboards and pidgeons secreting on policemen's shoulders. There are also jokes about farting, a sure sign of desperation. On the plus side, we see the return of G.W.Bailey as Captain Harris. That's about it on the plus side. The whole film looks rushed and is mostly set at night or on grey skied days that make it look awful. Not a pleasant film to watch. However, the public, including myself, flocked to see it. But, hey, you don't know what you're gonna get until you have paid your admission.</p>
