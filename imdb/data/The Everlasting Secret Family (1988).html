<h1>The Everlasting Secret Family (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A beautiful, if ambitious and amoral, youth is tapped to become the lover of a powerful senator. The young man quickly realizes that he can hold this place, with all its perks, only as long as he is young. He has no other function than being young. With the help of an aged judge, the young man, referred to only as The Lover, contrives a plan to make a change in the way of the world, a plan that will take him years to realize. To succeed, he must manipulate, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, the senator, his wife, the family chauffeur (who was, when young, a lover), and, by implication, the entire well-planned and controlling everlasting secret family.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Affluent Australian senator & government minister (Arthur Dignam) spies an athletic teenager (Mark Lee) at an private school's track & field event. A chauffeured limousine is sent to the school in the days later to bring the teen to a hotel to have sex with the senator. This becomes a regular occurrence even though the public reputation of the senator would be destroyed were the arrangement to become public.As he becomes the senator's rent boy and enjoys certain extravagant privileges the youth is also expected to provide sexual favours to men whom the senator designates (timeshare?). The boy, who is never named, develops a haughty attitude even (or especially) as he is passed around by wealthy and powerful perverted old men. Concurrent to that is his membership in the secret society of which the senator is a member of high rank.The boy's place in the secret society appears, at first, to have a low ceiling. He fears he can hope to go only as high as a rent boy. Inevitably as he reaches adulthood and ages his currency will diminish after which he is told he may look forward to life as a chauffeur or some other form of blue collar servant. He seeks out a more beneficial arrangement with surprising results.Several mortifying political scandals (Profumo Scandal, Franklin Cover-Up) over the centuries have given examples which may have provided inspiration for what is shown in this film. But this really is a highly speculative account of imagined happenings in imagined secret societies which supposedly determine the major decisions that effect the lives of common everyday folk.The secret society myth is part of our modern folklore i.e. urban legends.</p>
