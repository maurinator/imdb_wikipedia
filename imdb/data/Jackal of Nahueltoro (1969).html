<h1>Jackal of Nahueltoro (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1960, José del Carmen Valenzuela Torres, from the small town of Nahueltoro in Chile, brutally murdered Rosa Rivas Acuña and her five children. This classic film of the Latin American cinema is based on testimonies provided by the murderer himself while he was being prosecuted and the journalists who interviewed him before his sentence was executed. Thirty two months after the massacre at age 23 and after learning how to read and write, "The Jackal of Nahueltoro" faced a firing squad.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Maybe the best Chilean movie, El Chacal de Nahueltoro lets me thinking about it many years since I saw at first time. This raw picture about Chile shows us a lot of topics: poverty that leds to violence, the system that improve a human being and finally kills him, the death penalty, etc. The images of this movie are impossible to forget. The work of Héctor Ríos (cinematography) and Pedro Chaskel (editing) is superb. The performing of Nelson Villagra is one of the best I've never seen in all movies (chileans and foreigns). Miguel Littin was unable to repeat such a success in his other movies.</p>
