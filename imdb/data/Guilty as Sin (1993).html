<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If it could be called anything, 'Guilty as Sin' is a missed opportunity, and that's putting it lightly. It could have been a great thriller, but something went wrong in the process, and the result is a mess, a failed vision abandoned halfway through. All of the blame lies in the obvious lack of interest on the part of the filmmakers. Sidney Lumet has directed THE best film of the 80s in 'Running on Empty', and one of the better 70s pics in 'Dog Day Afternoon', so the problem isn't a lack of talent. It's just that the makers of this movie were lazy, making it because they needed money, a job to be done as quick and painlessly as possible.Because of this everything falls apart. Adding complications, DeMornay is seriously miscast. Though no one is doubting her ample acting skills, she looks misplaced here and just isn't all that good. Don Johnson on the other hand, is perfect for his role, though he may not be as good of an actor as DeMornay is.'Guilty as Sin' is nothing more than a tedious, connect-the-dots thriller that wastes the talents of everyone involved. It isn't impossible to watch, it's just that it's not very good.4/10</p>
