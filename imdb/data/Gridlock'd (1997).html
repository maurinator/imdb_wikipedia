<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The mixing in of the past into the present makes me think of Pulp Fiction. Of course Tim Roth, excellent again, might have pushed my thoughts that way unconsciously.There is a scene involving a pocketknife - to avoid spoiling your fun I won't say more - at the very end of the film which had me rolling around laughing with tears in my eyes.</p>
