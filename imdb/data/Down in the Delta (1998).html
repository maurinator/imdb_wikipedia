<h1>Down in the Delta (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Rosa Lynn sends her druggie daughter Loretta and her children Thomas and Tracy away from the big city to live with their uncle Earl in the ancestral home in rural Mississippi. Earl puts Loretta to work in his restaurant, Just Chicken, while also telling them about the generations of their family, the Sinclairs, dating back to their time in slavery before the the Civil War.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I knew how this movie was going to end after viewing the first 30 minutes. But, despite that, the journey was worthwhile.  The film could have been done a better job of capturing the feeling of the "Delta" had it not been filmed in Canada.</p>
