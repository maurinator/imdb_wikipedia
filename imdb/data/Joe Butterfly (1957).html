<h1>Joe Butterfly (1957)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The staff of "Yank" magazine are among the first American troops into Tokyo after the Japanese surrender. Their mission: produce an issue of the magazine...in three days. To accomplish the seeming impossible, they reluctantly enlist the aid of black marketeer and arch-conniver Joe Butterfly, who sets them up in a palatial private mansion, complete with lovely daughter -- strictly against regulations. How much trouble can our heroes talk their way out of?</p>
<p>American soldiers in occupied Tokyo get mixed up with a conniving black-marketeer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Audie Murphy, the decorated WW II soldier is remembered today for his entertaining westerns and war films of the post war era. However, in this comic outing, Murphy and pals hit post war Japan and all sorts of hi-jinks develop in quick succession.Audie is at ease here in the title role and brings an easy-going charm to a slightly above-average storyline. Keenan Wynn and John Agar offer fine support in a pleasing film that served to stretch Murphy out of his westerns rut.This is the sort of film that demands little from the viewer, yet provides a pleasant viewing experience even for non-fans of the legendary war hero. Well worth another look.</p>
