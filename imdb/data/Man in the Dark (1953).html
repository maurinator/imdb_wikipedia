<h1>Man in the Dark (1953)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A thug is convicted and undergoes experimental brain surgery to remove the criminal element in his brain. The operation wipes out all memories of his past life, including where he stashed the loot. He is abducted by his gang and they try to beat the truth out of him. His memories return in the form of weird dreams, and he and his old girlfriend track down the clues to find the money.</p>
<p>Columbia's first 3-D production (released originally in Sepiatone) and also the first 3-D feature from a major studio---"Bwana Devil" was an indie production distributed by United Artists---has a story featuring gangster Steve Rawley who, while in jail on a robbery charge, undergoes an experimental brain operation designed to eradicate his criminal tendencies. He loses his memory and is kidnapped by his old cronies who want to get their hands on the hidden loot for which he has been serving time. He eventually, through a series of wild dreams, recovers his memory before the climax in an eerily-lit amusement park, highlighted by a wild chase on and over a roller coaster.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Originally made in 3-D, this is another of Columbia's black & white releases of this genre (like Vincent Price in the Mad Magician). 3-D process and numerous subjective camera techniques (like scapels used in operation coming out at the screen, bullets firing at speeding cars, whirling around car rides at an amusement park, etc.)make this interesting viewing and out of the ordinary story about a thug who can't remember anything about his $130,000 heist after brain surgery.</p>
