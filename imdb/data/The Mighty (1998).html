<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This tells the story of a strong friendship between a young boy with Morquio's syndrome and an older boy who is always bullied because of his size. Adapted from the novel, Freak the Mighty, the film explores a building of trust and friendship. Kevin, an intelligent guy helps out Maxwell to improve his reading skills. In return, Kevin wants Maxwell to take him out places since he is not allowed out unauthorized. Being the social outcasts of the town, Kevin and Maxwell come to realize that they are similar to each other and accept that they are "freaks" and nothing will stop them.</p>
<p>This is a story of two guys: Max looks like a slow-moving idiot and is almost illiterate and Kevin has a rare disease that physically deformed him. Kevin lives next door to Max and one day is assigned as a reading tutor to him. Together they travel to the land of knights and heroes in their books.</p>
<p>This is the heart-warming story of a unique friendship shared by two seventh grade boys, Kevin and Max. Kevin, afflicted with a rare physical disability that prevents him from living a normal childhood, is an extremely intelligent boy who lives in the world of his imagination. Max on the other hand, is an over-weight boy who suffers from a learning disability and has failed the seventh grade several times. Fate brings the boys together when Kevin is assigned to tutor Max in his reading skills; here their magical journey begins. These two boys, who appear on the surface to have nothing in common, find they share many painful realities of being outcasts, and of being abandoned by their fathers early in life. Kevin's enchanting world of knights and their quest for justice is brought into reality through his exciting journey with Max. Through their adventures, they find a friendship providing completeness of self and an unbreakable bond of love.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was very good. I don't usually rate a movie a full ten. I believe that I have only rated maybe a dozen movies in my lifetime this high. The ending musical score will make one soar with the bird. It is an amazing final scene. Others I have scored high are Network, A Clockwork Orange, O Brother, Where Art Thou? The Long Riders and Cat Ballou. I believe that Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone did not receive enough on screen time. The Mighty flowed pretty smooth and there weren't a lot of slow periods. I would have liked to have seen more action when the boys were bullied but then again that may have given younger viewers ideas. But beware..the soundtrack to The Mighty does not include the ending theme music which is the best part of the soundtrack.</p>
