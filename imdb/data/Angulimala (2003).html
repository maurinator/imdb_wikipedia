<h1>Angulimala (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Arhingsaka was born in India to a noble family. Despite his noble birth, his horoscope showed to be born under the sign of thieves, and thus was preordained for a wicked life. On his 16th birthday his father sent him to complete his education and Arhingsaka became the teacher's favorite; the other jealous students told the master that Arhingsaka was flirting with the teachers wife. Deciding to punish his former star pupil, he told Arhingsaka : "You have almost completed your training; there is just one thing left to do. Once you finish your life of suffering will be over, and you will become a Bodhisattva. You must single-handedly kill 1,000 people" Arhingsaka changed: once he was bright and his mind light; he was tall, handsome and muscular. Now he turned grim and ugly, hunched over and plodding. He no longer laughed or spoke and he haunted the forests like a wild animal. He endeavored to complete his task, until an enlightening encounter with the Buddha halted his bloody quest. His new name, Angulimala, meant "garland of fingers", which he wore around his neck.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am a Thai, a Christian with a Buddhist background. And I must say that this is one of the best Thai films I've ever seen and also one of the best films that relate directly to Buddhism. (In my opinion it's better than "Little Buddha") This is not a big-budget movie so don't expect anything grand, but what makes this film excellent is the screenplay and the way the director keeps the movie right to its point from the beginning to the end. The maker of this films really did understand the message of the story and he presented it very well, and surprisingly, in the way that isn't too hard to understand, with all the excitement of a good film that keeps the audience attention the whole way through. (but for non-Thai people, I suggest that you watch this film with a good subtitle, one that is translated very well so that the meaning of the film won't be lost.) Angulimala is based on the Buddhist scripture story. It's about a man who has been looking for a way to spiritual enlightenment since he was a young child. He has a keen and powerful mind, great determination and strength.However,along the way he got confused and lost his way, thinking that killing people is the way to free them from misery and the way to purify his soul. He is determined to kill 1,000 people and collect their fingers in his necklace. Then the film will show us how the Buddha could help such a man who seem to be on the extremely wrong path of belief to stop and turn back to the true light.Some Buddhist message and Hindu belief may seem a little unfamiliar to Western people, but this is one film that present the teaching of the Buddha so correctly and in a universal way that people of all religions can relate to it. I was very impressed.In my opinion, the directing, the cast, the editing, and the special effects of this film are just about right. I enjoyed the story from the beginning to the end. Yes, the music maybe a little too repetitive but I still find it effective. I like the way they mixed the Buddhist chant with the orchestra.Watch this film. It's really a good one. I highly recommend it.</p>
