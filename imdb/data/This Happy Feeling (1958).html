<h1>This Happy Feeling (1958)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>On a stormy night, young woman asks another guest at party to rescue her from her lecherous boss and take her to the train station. When her rescuer suggests that she stop at his place to get out of her wet clothes, she dashes from his car. The door she knocks on for help is the home of a retired actor and there she spends the rest of the night. He makes no passes and next morning she discovers young man who drove her from party is next door neighbor. The two men compete for her affections. Older man's zany live-in house-keeper and a seagull she has rescued provide comic relief.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Lifeless suburban-comedy has Blake Edwards' name on it, but nowhere is there evidence of his comedic spirit or comic timing (true, he's an uneven filmmaker, but this is way off the mark). Debbie Reynolds plays a virginal secretary holding strong to her virtue while working for handsome actor Curt Jurgens; John Saxon plays a neighbor boy who befriends her. Blake Edwards adapted the screenplay from the theatrical piece "For Love Or Money" written by a fellow named F. Hugh Herbert--HIS name alone is funnier than anything in Blake's script! Is this material supposed to be sophisticated? If so, it's about as satirical and sparkling as dinner theater in the Amazon. * from ****</p>
