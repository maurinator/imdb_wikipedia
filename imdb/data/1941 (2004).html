<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Inya, a heroine of the Philippine resistance against the Japanese during World War II, recalls events involving her husband Edilberto and their childhood friend Ignacio, a transvestite who, masquerading as a woman also named Inya, becomes the lover of the local Japanese commander, Ichiru, and is caught between a duty to be a spy for his country and friends and his reluctant but growing love for Ichiru.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I rented out this movie with friends and I expect that its going to be another Filipino drama movie. I was wrong.Its rare to find these gems in the Filipino cinema. I love the way it is narrated using flashback techniques and notably, the acting done by Trillo, Santiago and Jose.Character development is very rich which makes the viewing experience very memorable. The special effects used are somewhat mediocre (the explosion effects of the bombs dropped off from the Japanese planes) but the costumes, language ('pure' Tagalog) and yes! the vintage cars used in that era were faithfully shown.The major aspect that I love about this film is how they achieved the 'fulfillment'that educated viewers will surely appreciate because of its multidimensional approach in achieving the ultimate objective - To tell the story!</p>
