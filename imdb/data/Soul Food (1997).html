<h1>Soul Food (1997)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Matriarch Mama Joe has held her family together for 40 years around a Sunday dinner of soul food. When diabetes hospitalizes her, the dinners stop and tensions among her three daughters start to break the family apart. Two of the sisters feud continuously: Teri is jealous of Maxine's marriage and irritated that everyone assumes her corporate salary is open to the rest of the family's uses. Maxine resents Teri's bossiness and insensitivity to family tradition. Bird, the youngest, newly married to an ex-con, accepts a favor from an old lover that leads to her husband's arrest. Mama Joe's grandson Ahmad cooks up a scheme to bring the family together, back to the table.</p>
<p>One person can keep a family together and, when that one person is gone, a family can be torn apart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I think Soul Food does more than reveal a truly selfish brood of sisters (Williams, Fox, Long). Through the eyes of a child, it looks at family and blood values and finds them strong enough to beat any adversity. These are real people with real problems (unemployment, depression, desires, frustrations, goals and greed), there is no logic in those situations. You work with the essentials and learn as you go along.  The sisters learn to accept each other's kinks and twists, even if it means swallowing their pride. This truly is food for the soul.A searching movie!!!</p>
