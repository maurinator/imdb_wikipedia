<h1>Elizabeth (2011)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>We saw Elizabeth working in her garden and asked her for an interview. She agreed and told us about growing up in the Philippines and her dreams of seeing the world. While working as a secretary, Elizabeth met and eventually married a German man. When she was 34 years old she moved to Neuhausen. Today, Elizabeth's four children are grown and she enjoys working in her garden. She loves roses.</p>
