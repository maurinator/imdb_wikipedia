<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Granted the premise has been done, but this is a fun suspense film and also as Josh Lucas in it, so add a few stars.Radha Mitchell is basically a restaurant/motel owner in a desolate Oregon town. She has a customer (Barry Watson, child actor from "Seventh Heaven" for anyone who recalls that series, circa 1997).Anyway, odd things start to occur and her doctor friend becomes a victim. Three strangers apparently on vacation drop in, and proceed to terrorize her.Radha Mitchell is believable though, and has since been in a Woody Allen film ("Melinda and Melinda") so she does a few things right.Watch for Josh Lucas in recent period piece "Stolen" also with Jon Hamm (from "Mad Men") a nice suspense film recently made in 2009. Overall give "Strangers" a chance. 8/10.</p>
