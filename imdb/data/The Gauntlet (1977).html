<p>Ben Shockley is a Phoenix cop assigned to go to Las Vegas, so that he can escort a prostitute named Gus Mally who is supposed to testify in a mob trial. Shockley assumes he got the assignment because he can get the job done. But his bosses have been bought off, and the only reason he was chosen was because he is expendable and unreliable. In addition, the Mally doesn't want to go with him because she knows that going along is the equivalent of signing her own death warrant. Odds of their safe arrival are not good, and there is even a line in Vegas on whether they will make it alive. Everyone's out to get them. Traps are everywhere. So Shockley and Gus are forced to rely on instinct and ingenuity if they are going to make it to Phoenix alive.</p>
<p>A hard but mediocre cop is assigned to escort a prostitute into custody from Las Vegas to Phoenix, so that she can testify in a mob trial. But a lot of people are literally betting that they won't make it into town alive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This baroque and utterly implausible action drama subscribes to the over-the-top theory of movie making. Huge quantities of bullets, bikers and bad apples are unleashed on Mr.Eastwood, Ms. Locke, his remand witness, and us, the audience. Eastwood executes the gauntlet with great resolve and resourcefulness: he even knows how to fortify a bus with armored plates. Clint is in peak form and Locke will never again reach the heights that she does here. Clearly, the two have wonderful screen chemistry and would remain together as a couple for more than a decade. Watching the film today, I think there is a scene that went missing--or was cut. It occurred at the beginning of the movie and involved the sadistic police commissioner and Locke's prostitute. The scene is later described in great detail by Locke when she and Clint are on the lam in a desert cave. So where is it? My dad took me to see this "R" rated film on a bitterly cold night in early February '78--it was released in late '77. I think he was unaware of the rating because I did get an eyeful that night. Make sure you see this movie letterboxed in order to absorb all the destructive power and subtle artistry on display.</p>
