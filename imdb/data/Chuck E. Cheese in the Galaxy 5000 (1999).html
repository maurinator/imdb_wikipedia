<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>this musical is goodish every chuck e cheese fan would like this there is 7 songs a lot for a short movie but this is a movie for your whole family to watch the kids would love it it is unrated but i would rate it G but with pro's there's also some cons pro number one the kids would enjoy this like the pizzeria itself pro number two its a nice and clean movie for everyone to watch con number one there are to many singing like one song every 5 mints con number two every mascot is a man in a costume con number three none of the actors are good i would definitely not recommend you to watch this movie if you happen to want to buy this it is only on VHS the averaged of the price is 45.00 not worth it</p>
