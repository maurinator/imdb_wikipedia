<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved the film Link.  It's one of my favorite suspense films.  I love it because of it's twists and turns.  Plus because of it's great and amazing music score by Jerry Goldsmith.  I also like Chimpanzees.  I recommend it because it's one of my all time favorite suspense/horror films plus I own it and have seen it hundreds of times.  I give it 2 thumbs up for acting and surprises along the way.</p>
