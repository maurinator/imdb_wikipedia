<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A bleak, atmospheric movie, filmed entirely on  location at New York's Bellevue Hospital. Fine performances by Conte, Gray, Alexander and a slew of New York stage actors. Note the brief but significant appearance, at the beginning of the movie, by Hugh Reilly, who went on to star in the Lassie TV series.</p>
