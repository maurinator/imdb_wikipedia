<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you're a fan of James Garnder, George Kennedy or Nigel Green, then The Pink Jungle will make an enjoyable late night flick. It's light-hearted fluff to say the least. Lots of cornball jokes, over-the-top acting, stereotyping of Latinos, and light action. The whole movie looks like it was filmed on the back lot of Universial Studios. George Kennedy steals the movie as a rough and tumble Diamond smuggler. James Gardner does a pre-Rockford type performance. Nigel Green is the "Bad Guy", and beautiful Eva Renzi provides the love interest. Michael Ansara and George Rose give their typical solid performances. If it's a late, rainy, stormy night, then The Pink Jungle is a nice way to kill about two hours.</p>
