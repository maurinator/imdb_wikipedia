<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When the DEA shut down its dummy corporation operation codenamed SWORDFISH in 1986, they had generated $400 million which they let sit around; fifteen years of compound interest has swelled it to $9.5 billion. A covert counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell, headed by the duplicitious and suave Gabriel Shear, wants the money to help finance their raise-the-stakes vengeance war against international terrorism, but it's all locked away behind super-encryption. He brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson, who only wants to see his daughter Holly again but can't afford the legal fees, to slice into the government mainframes and get the money.</p>
<p>In this futuristic technology spy movie, John Travolta plays Gabriel Shear, a man who is desperately trying to access information that is locked inside a complicated computer system that contains mountains of government secrets - and money. He hires Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a desperate computer expert, to help him hack into the system.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If one is seeking an action oriented tale which is packed with all the right ingredients, such as drama, sex, beauty and an exciting story line, the film, Swordfish is it. The plot is of a sophisticated, philosophy driven, definitely clever, master criminal, Gabriel Shear (John Travolta,) who discovers the F. B.I. has amassed over a billion dollars and is keeping it's where-abouts secret from the public eye. He means to have it, whatever it takes. Few are worried the fortune is in danger of being stolen as the billions in U.S. currency are stored and kept in a vault guarded and defended by a super-computer who's electronic defenses include an ingeniously engineered cryptic and unbreakable 500 Gigwatt cryptic combination. However, all this changes when top cop and D. E. A. Agent J.T. Roberts (Don Cheadle) learns the master criminal has hired the two most celebrated and re-known computer hackers from around the world. One of them is Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) who is promised $10.000.000 and his daughter's safe return if he can break and hack into the super guarded computer to retrieve the money. Helping, Don Chedel is voluptuous and riveting super model, Halley Berry who brings all of her delicious form to the big screen. The film erupts with a hair-raising, dynamically driven explosion which then launches itself into an equally captivating film. Keep your eyes on the dynamic players as they combine to create a classic. ****</p>
