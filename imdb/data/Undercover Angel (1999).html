<h1>Undercover Angel (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A writer with no focus in his work, becomes the unwilling babysitter of a precocious little girl who turns his life around.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a great movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy together. There is something for everyone.  Romance and drama for the older people, while the kids are amused by the antics and mischief of a 6 year old girl.The acting is amazing.  Emily Mae Young is outstanding, as she steals the show away from the adults with ease.  The adults (Dean Winters and Yasmine Bleeth) provide performances which make this movie very well rounded.  In my opinion, this is a movie that is great for a day with the family.</p>
