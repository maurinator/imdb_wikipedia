<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Episodic tale of four factory girls and their various romances at the local dance hall.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This post war film is one I watched with Len Colyer whose name you can see in the credits as one of the professional dancers backing up the actors in their competition scenes.The film isn't one I would recommend seeing twice but if you are interested in history and want to see what life is like for people in England after the country was torn apart then the film will hold your attention for it's short duration.The drama in the film is of course melodramatic and over the top but that can also be an attractive element to those of us that wish life to be dramatically over the top and more complicated then it actually is.Worth a watch if you get a chance, but harder the second time around.</p>
