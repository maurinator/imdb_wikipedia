<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a film that has several things going for it, none of them technical. The idea of  shooting a movie with a largely black cast on dark streets at night without any sort of  extra lighting is... well, a bad one, and coupled with its mic-in-the-cameraman's-back- pocket sound mix, an awful lot of the first half of the movie is just shy of being  incomprehensible. Add in an editing job that suggests somebody was busy talking on  the phone during the cutting of several key scenes, and you could have a real patience- tester of a film on your hands. Thankfully, the mood of the film is positive enough that its deliriously illogical plot  actually works in its favour. Greasy kid Mario van Peebles (minus the "van" here) is  transformed into strapping man Melvin van Peebles in a meaningful encounter with a  hooker, and you can buy it. On-the-lam hero Sweetback is challenged to a duel by  bikers, and nobody so much as blinks when he suggests that it should be a duel of  sexual prowess... hell, they don't even seem to care that he doesn't need to move in  order to drive his women wild. He's even brought back from the dead by the chorused  voices of The Black Community, and it all sort of makes sense, kind of. In fact, it isn't until the very last shot of the movie, when you realize that 90 minutes  and change have built up to... well, nothing much, really, except maybe a shred of belief  in the power of an act of will, and perhaps the promise of a sequel, that you feel like  taking the movie to task for its gaping technical flaws again. Even then, it's made so  earnestly that I don't really have the heart to slag it for its ineptly-blocked camerawork and dreadful acting. I've seen much worse from filmmakers who weren't trying to  change the world by giving a damn, so instead I'll talk it up by calling it the spiritual  ancestor of the basketball-teleportation ending to He Got Game, and pretty much  everything in The Matrix, too. That it was largely the work of one hugely inspired guy  makes it all the cooler, so struggling filmmakers, take note! As long as you crib your  technique from other places, Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song should be an inspiration to you.</p>
