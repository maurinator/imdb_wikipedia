<h1>Sister Act (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Karen asks Dana to help her break the ice with a cute guy named Michael, but the man asks Dana out instead. Later, Dana is talking with one of the Foster sisters' mutual friends, and Dana re-enforces the idea that Karen and Michael are not dating. Unknown to Dana, J.T. is tape-recording the private telephone conversation. Later, J.T. plays back the tape to Karen, who then realizes that Dana has snared the guy that she had her eye on; J.T. hopes that, by sharing his ill-gotten knowledge, Dana and Karen will get into such a violent fight both of them will kill each other. Karen is upset and calls Michael up, telling him that Dana is 14 years old. Michael breaks off the relationship, informing her that her "older" sister revealed the information. Dana goes home to confront Karen, but cooler heads prevail - Karen admits she is jealous of Dana, whose biggest asset is her brains. Dana reassures Karen that she is smart, funny and beautiful and all is well. In the end, not only does J.T.'s plan never come to pass, he (and Al and Brendan as well) all get taught a hard lesson about listening in on private phone conversations. In the subplot, Frank's anxiety over dancing at various receptions he and Carol are guests at is the result of his inability to dance. Cody helps Frank get over his problem.</p>
