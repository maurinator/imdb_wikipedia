<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Small One is so sweet and charming, that for instance it brought tears to my eyes with the boy being so tender towards Small One the Donkey. I love this, and think it is underrated, and I watch it every Christmas. The animation is beautiful, and just adds to the beauty of the film. The story was simple and gentle, demonstrating you can't have everything to meet your own needs, even if it means losing a friend. What made me cry as well as the relationship between the boy and Small One was the title song. So haunting and even heart-rending, with meaningful lyrics. I will say that I never was a fan of Sean Marshall's singing voice on Pete's Dragon, and while it was an improvement here, I still didn't like it that much. But compared to the overall beauty of the film, it is a minor criticism. I thought Small One was adorable, and I did feel angry that anyone would want to kill an innocent donkey. I loved the ending, the character of Joseph was so well-spoken, kind and sensitive, that it warmed my heart. Overall, a really sweet film. 9/10 Bethany Cox.</p>
