<h1>Mr. Billion (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Anthony Falcon is a billionaire. After he dies, he leaves his entire estate to his Italian nephew, Guido Falcone, a mechanic who wishes to be a cowboy. To get his inheritance, he has to go to California and within a specified time or the estate will fall under the control of the executor, John Cutler, who wishes that to happen. And it might just happen, cause Guido doesn't like to fly, so by the time he gets to America, he will just have enough time to get there. But running into some undesirable individuals, he loses all of his money and has to find a way to get there. Cutler has also sent Rosie Jones to try to get Guido to sign a paper, wherein he relinquishes all claims to the estate but she instead falls for him.</p>
<p>When an American billionaire dies, his poor Italian nephew inherits everything, provided he can arrive in the USA to claim his inheritance before the deadline but the corporate lawyer-executor tries to steal the inheritance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jackie Gleason plays it straight as the bad guy, and has trouble pulling it off.  Too bad, because everyone else here is having a marvelous time, especially spaghetti western veteran Terrence Hill in the lead.  An enjoyable supporting cast is led by Slim Pickens and William Redfield.  This is just diverting fluff and would be a more-than-adequate time passer for the small screen if not for Gleason.</p>
