<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Baltimore industrialist Wendell Armbruster crosses paths with London shop girl Pamela Piggott when they come to Ischia to pick up the bodies of her mother and his father, who have been killed in an automobile accident after a ten-year summertime affair. Straitlaced Wendell tries to avoid a scandal while free-spirited Pamela is impressed by the romantic setting. After some confusion with the bodies and a blackmail attempt by unscrupulous locals, Wendell and Pamela extend their parent's affair into the next generation.</p>
<p>Harried straight-laced Baltimore-based business executive Wendell Armbruster, Jr. is rushing to Ischia, Italy to claim the body of his father, who died in a car accident. Wendell's father spent a month vacation by himself at the same Ischia resort every summer for the past ten years. On his way to Ischia, Wendell keeps bumping into a young English woman who seems to know who he is and who he thinks is following him. Upon arriving at the resort, he learns that she is Pamela Piggott, the daughter of his father's long term mistress, who also died in the accident. Pamela knew and accepted her mother's indiscretion, whereas Wendell knew nothing of his father's secret life. In addition to the shock he is feeling, Wendell is also feeling the stress of needing to get his father's body back to Baltimore in time for the service in three days, not an easy task due to the mound of legal red tape, the fact that no one works on Sunday (one of those three days) and that in Italy things move at a slower pace. Despite the differences in their viewpoints, Wendell and Pamela decide to honor their respective parent's memory by doing things in Ischia their parents would have done while he prepares to take his father's body home. Beyond the earlier mentioned issues, Wendell seems to face one problem after another in him and his father making it back to Baltimore on time and without scandal. Although Bruno, the resort's valet, is trying to extort a favor from Wendell, Bruno may end up being the answer to all Wendell's problems.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So much has been said about the plot of Avanti it seems pointless to go over the synopsis again- but I can say although I am a lover of Horror films, Thrillers and Westerns- it is Avanti that is my favourite film of all time.Avanti is gorgeous to look at and features a beautiful music score. How I wish I could obtain a soundtrack of this delightful score. The scene when Pamela Pigott ( Juliet Mills ) tours the city on a horse drawn carriage and later running from her new found admirers is beautiful with the music so perfect.Also when Pamela and Wendell ( Jack Lemmon ) have their evening meal together , it is again a beautiful music score. Jack Lemmon as the bombastic Wendell Armbruster is as always great. Juliet Mills as Pamela Pigott looks far too gorgeous to be ridiculed by Armbruster but she shines in her finest ever role. However for me the film is stolen completely by Clive Revill as the hotel manager- what a sublime performance. Watch his every movement, his every expression, his delivery of every line.It is a captivating performance, totally exquisite. Clive Revill is an actor sorely neglected by the film world.Billy Wilder's film is so very neglected and it's a pity as this is the perfect film. Watch the beautiful, poignant sequence at the mortuary as Pamela and Wendell view the bodies of their mother and father respectively. And again watch Clive Revill alongside Lemmon and Mills- acting with only movement, expression and not a word. The lighting in this scene is so wonderful, it is dark and depressing with the exception of a shaft of sunlight penetrating the smallest of windows. Wilder manages to wring excellent portrayals out of even the most minor of characters. Watch Avanti and savour the acting, the music and the scenery.</p>
