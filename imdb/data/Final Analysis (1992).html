<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Psychiatrist Dr. Isaac Barr (Richard Gere) is treating Diana Baylor (Uma Thurman). His testimony gets Pepe Carrero released angering police detective Huggins (Keith David). Diana's sister Heather Evans (Kim Basinger) comes to his office. They have an affair but her husband Jimmy Evans (Eric Roberts) is a violent Greek gangster.This tries to be a Hitchcockian thriller using every superficial ways. The acting is melodramatically broad. Even the music is reminiscent of the most popular Hitchcock. It feels old and badly overwrought. It's a showy copy of better movies. It would be more compelling to NOT show the killing. It would allow the audience to guess at the truth of the incident and build paranoia which the great master would have done. The movie has to understand that the psychobabble is meaningless to the normal audience. This relies on us believing the jury would buy the psychobabble. For a movie relying on psychiatry, these people are simple-minded. I don't feel for any of these characters. I certainly don't care about Gere's character and by extension, I don't care about this movie.</p>
