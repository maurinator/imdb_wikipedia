<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I first saw Orphans(1987) back in "88" as a rental. It was recomended by a friend who honestly I thought had no taste in movies and had suggested many stinkers to me before. Well I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day, and he was right that day. I happened to be at the video store the other day and noticed this sitting in the Video Bargain Bin for a Buck. All that came to mind was "That was a good movie", after watching it again some fifteen years later I was wrong. That was a great movie. An Acting Toure de Force. The movie stars Matthew Modine, Albert Finney, and Kevin Anderson. And ALL ARE EXCELLENT! Perfectly Directed by Alan Pakula the same director that directed Sophies Choice, All the Presidents Men, and Klute. If you are a guy in search of a good movie you can't go wrong with Orphans(1987). Unbelievabley this is not out on DVD as of the writing of this comment.</p>
