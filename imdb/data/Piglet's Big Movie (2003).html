<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you think of Disney you think of children's movies and children's cartoons. Piglets Big Movie is for a child. My brothers and sisters enjoyed it and after watching the movie myself I have to say the movie was exactly like a children's movie should be. There was imagination, friendship,and adventure. There was no cussing no violence it was like any other Winnie the pooh movie, and who can say poohs silly ways are ever dull and boring. I know I always get in at least ten laughs with each Winnie the pooh movie which is saying something when it is a children's movie. This movie is a must see for younger children, and I guess anyone who doesn't have a problem with realizing that most Disney movies are stories made for young children</p>
