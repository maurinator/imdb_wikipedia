<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of Jesus' life as told by the apostle John, narrated by Christopher Plummer.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen all the Jesus  movies and all are a little bit too stylized. This movie I felt was real.  It is verbatim, and it shows what the day to day living was like for Jesus and his times.  I especially liked the carpenter scene.  I have always believed that Jesus was as an ordinary man until the time was right.  That he would have had to work for a living. That he would have fulfilled all of his father's  commands, including the one which state that we had to toil for our bread.   I felt the frustration but loving patience of our Lord, as he tried to convince his people, the Jews, that he was the one and that their hour was now.  He succeeded in splitting the Jews into believers and non-believer and that condition exist to this day not only for them but for all who hear the message.  Jesus is personal and approachable.  I am looking forward to the PASSION, since this movie is about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life amongst us.  To be told in a 3 hour movie also.  I just hope the Gospels are all made an illustrated with the beauty, simplicity, faithfulness and Love of this movie.</p>
