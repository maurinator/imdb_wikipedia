<h1>Night of the Comet (1984)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Two pretty high school girls (one a cheerleader!) don't like their stepmother or her new boyfriend ("Daddy would have gotten us Uzis!"). One morning, they wake up to find that everybody in Los Angeles has been turned to dust by a Comet except them, a guy who looks like Erik Estrada, some zombies and the occupants of a secret underground government installation.</p>
<p>Two girls from the Valley wake up to find that a passing comet has eradicated their world and left behind a mysterious red-dust and a pack of cannibal mutants. With the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save the earth from a villainous "think tank," karate chop their way through flesh-eating zombies, and, of course, find time to go to the mall.</p>
<p>Two sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. It becomes apparant that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when the Earth recently passed through the tail of a comet has been reduced to a pile of red ash (the trace elements of human chemical makeup.) They encounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but idiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.</p>
<p>A comet wipes out most of life on Earth, leaving two Valley Girls to fight the evil types who survive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I originally saw this movie in the theater, and I LOVED it!  I had often fantasized about the end of the world where only myself a few others had survived.  Well, I'm 16 years older now, and not quite as misanthropic, but I still got a kick out of watching this again the other night.  Sure, the soundtrack was atrocious, and some of the acting was sub-par, but the sheer aplomb that "Samantha" has carries the film, I thought.Plus, it was fun to see Robert Beltran (ST: Voyager's second in command), so much younger!Quite a few laughs, and a pretty good plot twist or two to keep you guessing makes this an easy movie to enjoy.My rating: 7</p>
