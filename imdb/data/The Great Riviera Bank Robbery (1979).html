<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of fascists plan to finance their work by pulling off a bank robbery.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I have seen this film several times and impressed with its sharp action. It almost has a slight documentary feel to it.I am really surprised this film is not wider known.  It was on video several years back, but then withdrawn.  I have been begging for a copy for years and hope it will be re released soon.</p>
