<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A film, slickly directed by Chetan Anand and produced by Dev Anand's Navketan. A very good entertainer with very good music by Sachin Dev Burman. After having given music for a classic like "Devdas" in 1955, Burman da proved his versatality as he came up trumps with his musical score in this light hearted entertainer in 1956. Kishore Kumar's "Ai meri topi palat ke aa" and " Dene wala jab bhi deta, poora chhapad phaad ke deta" are lovely light numbers. So are the two duets by Kishore and Asha Bhosle, "Aji aaj koi na hamen chhediyo" and "Woh dekhen to unki inayat, na dekhen to rona kya"! Kishore's "Dukhi man mere, sun mera kehna" remains one of his best numbers ever. Dev Anand gave a good performance, while Sheila Ramani was a perfect foil to him.</p>
