<h1>The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Sherlock Holmes' younger brother is annoyed that he has had to live in Sherlock's shadow for so long. When Sherlock goes to the continent, he sends a case to his brother who constantly tries with varying success, to imitate Sherlock's deductive and observational tricks.</p>
<p>In 1891, Queen Victoria has handed over an important document to her Foreign Secretary, Lord Redcliff. The document is soon stolen from his safe. The document getting into the wrong hands could mean the start of war. As such, Queen Victoria personally contacts Sherlock Holmes to recover the document. Knowing exactly what he is doing concerning recovery of the document, Sherlock passes along one of his lesser cases to his younger brother, Sigerson Holmes, who detests his older brother as he believes he is much smarter than his more famous sibling. Regardless, Sigerson takes that case of a woman calling herself Bessie Bellwood, a music hall performer who is being blackmailed. By Sigerson's side is his new assistant, a Scotland Yard records clerk named Orville Stanley Sacker, who has a unique set of talents. Sigerson and Orville's investigation gets them into one predicament after another as they learn the true identity of their client, who has a connection to an opera singer named Eduardo Gambetti, to Lord Redcliff himself, and through association to Professor Moriarty - Sherlock Holmes' arch enemy - who is trying to recovery the Redcliff document himself to sell to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>The younger brother of the consulting detective tries to steal Sherlock's glory by solving an important case assisted by an eccentric Scotland Yard detective and a lovely but suspicious actress.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The other reviewer on this site clearly doesn't understand the subtleties of the comic genius of Gene Wilder (Sigerson Holmes), Madeline Kahn (Jenny Hill, or should I say Bessie Besswood), Marty Feldman (Sgt. Sacker of Scotland Yard) and the rest of the cast of this too little known classic! It's pithy and witty and clever and tips its hat to Conan Doyle at every turn. The Kangaroo Hop, Hop will have you hopping around the living room, and Madeline Kahn outdoes herself. It's right up there with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, and I'm waiting oh so patiently for it to be released on DVD! A must see for fans of the subtle and smart in comedy.</p>
