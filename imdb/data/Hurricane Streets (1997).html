Marcus wants to take a breather from the city and visit family in New Mexico.

He just wants to breathe open air. Can anything go right?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all like it has been said, this is not typical Hollywood garbage, resolution at end flick which is refreshing.. I grew up in blue collar New Jersey and the setting is NYC... The characters hit close to home and I had one of each of them close to me in my adolescent years.. I rented it not realizing that one of the cast, Carlo Alban was actually an acquaintance of mine in real life.. Apart from the fact that I have my own opinion about him, I think that he as well as the other actors involved do a great job in providing a realistic, down to earth portrayal of urban youth in the mid-late 90's.. The score is also not glamorous, but well done.. You are allowed to have a glimpse of the world seen through so many eyes, that is rarely done accurately on-screen... A well written movie.. See it..</p>
