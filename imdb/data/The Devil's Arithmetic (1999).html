<h1>The Devil's Arithmetic (1999)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This is another telling of the holocaust, but this time from the perspective of a modern teenage girl who only grudgingly accepts the Jewish traditions, but when she is asked to "open the front door" as part of the Seder feast finds herself, not unlike Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, to have entered the 1940's and has stepped into the life of a prisoner in one of the German death camps where she experiences all of its horrors firsthand.</p>
<p>Hannah Stern, an American-born Jewish adolescent, is uninterested in the culture, faith and customs of her relatives; however, Hannah begins to reevaluate her heritage when she has a supernatural experience that transports her back to a Nazi death camp in 1941. There, she meets a young girl named Rivkah, a fellow captive in the camp. As Rivkah and Hannah struggle to survive in the face of daily atrocities, they form an unbreakable bond.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old American girl with an apathetic view towards her Jewish family history finds herself pulled through time into 1941 to a small Polish village where the Nazi have just began their genocidal propaganda.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Overall, the films art direction, cinematography and story line remained consistently good throughout the film. Not knowing the book, I cannot comment on its accuracy. I can say that it kept my attention though out the film. Even though I wanted to see Toto leap up into Hannah's arms in the end, it was still a moving conclusion.</p>
