Dr. Evil stole a nuclear weapon and is demanding a payment of (when he realises its the 90's) 100 billion dollars. Can Austin Powers stop this madman? or will he caught up with Evil's henchman, with names like Alotta Fagina and Random Task? Only time will tell!</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In the 1960's Austin Powers is one of the UK's best secret agents. He  works as an international playboy who also fights international  terrorists. However when Dr Evil tries fails to kill him, Dr Evil  escapes into space where he is frozen until a time when he can return.  Austin Powers also freezes himself to be defrosted later. In the late  90's Dr Evil returns to wreck havoc on the world and only a defrosted  Powers can stop him  if he can adapt to the new world order.Mike Myers is very much an acquired taste but he did seem to hit it big  with this series of films. The original film set the tone with not very  basic jokes but certainly plenty of crude ones. The main film is split  between a fish out of water film, with Austin trying to come to terms  with the 90's, and also a James Bond spoof with Dr Evil as a more  frustrated Bond baddie (complete with cat and bald head). The fish out  of water stuff works well as Austin is a funny swinger and the 60's  stuff is cool, however the best bits for me all relate to Dr Evil   whether it be his relationship with his son or the asides where the see  the consequences of the death of his henchmen. The spoof on Bond movies  gets the best laughs from me.Myers is good in both roles and clearly has fun with both. Hurley is OK  but a bit wooden as Vanessa while Robert Wagner is good as number one.  Michael York (whoooooo?) is good as control and there are some good  cameos  Rob Lowe is funny but I still don't understand why the whole  Christian Slater bit was put in the final cut?!Overall it may be rude and slightly crude in places but there's still  plenty to enjoy. It's 90 minutes long but it's very funny and rushes  by. You may not remember much of the plot but at least you go away  chuckling.</p>
