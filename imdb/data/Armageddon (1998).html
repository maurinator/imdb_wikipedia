<h1>Armageddon (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It is just another day at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a few astronauts were repairing a satellite until, out of nowhere, a series of asteroids came crashing into the shuttle, destroying it. These asteroids also decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for space excavation, the asteroid is still heading towards the Earth. When the crew are launched into outer space, they are determined to destroy this asteroid.</p>
<p>Due to a shuttle's unfortunate demise in outer space, NASA becomes aware of a doomsday asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth. It seems that the only way to knock it off course is to drill into its surface and detonate a nuclear weapon. But as NASA's under-funded yet resourceful team train the world's best drillers for the job, the social order of the world begins to break down as the information reaches the public and hysteria results. As high-ranking officials play politics with the effort, the drilling team all faces deep personal issues which may jeopardize humanity's last chance...</p>
<p>A giant, global-killing asteriod, like the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is 18 days away from hitting the Earth. NASA's been caught with their pants down and needs a new plan to stop the rock. They enlist the help of Harry Stamper, an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb. But Harry figures the astronauts can't be trained in time and opts to go with his own oil drilling crew.</p>
<p>A huge Comet is headed for earth. As it does not consist of one big piece, but of a cloud of rather small pieces plus a main rock the size of Texas, little impacts are recorded long before the big one is scheduled for collision with earth. Harry S. Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device. The explosion of the bomb will break the comet in two, and the two pieces will pass earth on both sides. This task has to be accomplished before a certain "dead" line, or the comet parts will not fly by, but hit earth.</p>
<p>After New York City is damaged by hundreds of small meteorites, NASA discovers an asteroid the size of Texas is on a collision course with Earth. They recruit the best deep core driller in the world, Harry Stamper, to train astronauts who will go to the asteroid, drill into the center and detonate a nuclear warhead. Harry says he can't train men how to drill in ten days, so he brings in his own team of roughnecks to learn to become astronauts and get the job done. One of his team is the fianc√© of his own daughter.</p>
<p>After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, N.A.S.A. recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't care if it's a popcorn movie by intention. It's still a darn good movie. One that I can watch many times."The characters are predictable". Someone took this as a negative, but the reviewer was quite far from proving his point. Well, in case of Rock Hound, you can't really say that, can you? And neither can you in case of Harry Stomper. Would you say that Colonel Willie Sharp was predictable? Or Dan Truman? Not so, sorry.True, the story is a little far fetched. Then again no one remembers "Deep Impact", which was more or less about the same event, except written and performed so insignificantly, it felt into oblivion.The jokes. The funny situations. The funny dialogs. "Gee, lady, I just came here to drill". "So did I!" This movie has the cinematographic equivalent of salt and pepper, and just about right mix of the laughing gas and tear gas.For a long time I didn't know that, but I have been turning into a Michael Bay's fan. I saw him 2 times in this movie. He acted pretty well as a 2nd level supporting actor, but his real value is in directing and producing. I never expected Transformes to get my attention, and they did, which in itself is a big achievement.</p>
