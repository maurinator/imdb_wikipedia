But both his old crime partners and the dirty cop who caused him being jailed as a scape-goat and harassed him in prison push and prod for Wattsy to put his criminal talent to profitable use again for them. Once they have enlist his gullible adolescent brother Joey and dumb mate Johnny Francis 'Spit' Spitieri, Barry accepts. But this time he has his own agenda, and it's full of smashing surprises.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The marketing killed this one because it was a great film with brilliant performances but it seemed like another bad comedy. However it was really entertain and David Wenham was brilliant as Spit. The courtroom scene is classic stuff.the ending is a bit weak and sentimental but still a good film.</p>
