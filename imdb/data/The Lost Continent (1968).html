<h1>The Lost Continent (1968)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This film starts out like the Love Boat on acid, as a cast of varied characters, with various issues, take Captain Eric Porter's leaky cargo ship to escape their troubles. When a violent storm strikes, the ship is swept into the Sargasso Sea and our heroes find themselves trapped on an island of man-eating seaweed, populated by giant monster crabs and some Spanish conquistadors who think the Inquisition is still on. Features songs and music by '60s "cool group", the Peddlers.</p>
<p>On their way to South America, the passengers and crew of an old freighter face many challenges. The captain has taken on illegal cargo - a dangerous consignment of phosphorous that will explode if it comes into contact with water - something that worries the crew but less so for the passengers who all seem to have good reasons to continue their trip. When the ship takes on water some of the crew mutiny and eventually abandon ship. For those who stay aboard, they soon find themselves trapped in a huge bed of living seaweed and find a several centuries old Spanish galleon that has been trapped for all of that time - now manned by the descendants of the original crew. They will have to them if they are to survive.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Perhaps the strangest film to come out of Hammer Studios, The Lost Continent is literally like watching two movies in one.  Similar in format to Tarantino's From Dusk 'til Dawn, the film shifts from a taut "mutiny on the bounty" type nautical drama play (with a little funky late sixties weirdness thrown in) to a whacked out sci-fi freak show complete with corny monsters, strange & hostile plants, an unnaturally large breasted woman, a child King, an oddball religious cult, and balloon-type thingies to keep the characters afloat on the marshy alien wetlands! Whew!  Talk about your shift in gears! A must see for fans of oddball cinema.  And to think it came out of Great Britain . . .</p>
