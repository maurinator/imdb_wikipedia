<h1>Callan (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David Callan, top agent/assassin for the S.I.S., was forced to retire because he had lost his nerve. Now, Callan is called back into service to handle the assassination of Schneider, a German businessman. His former boss promises Callan that he'll be returned to active status if he follows orders, but as always Callan refuses to act until he knows why Schneider has been marked for death. This film is a remake of the same story presented in "A Magnum for Schneider."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I thought the film was very good. I like others at first approached the film with a jaundiced view, specifically the totally different effect of the music. However once viewed several times ones' view changes and accepts the film / music / different "Hunter" etc. afresh. No one else could play Callan other than Edward Woodward, the effect of Eric Porter as the new "Hunter" also becomes part of the whole fabric. I have seen the film many times now and to change anything or to try to align it with the way Callan was presented for TV would be detrimental.Enjoy it as it stands without prejudice. One weak spot, the scene where Callan is located with Lonely in a pub by one of Mears' henchmen; you could never jam a kiosk door with a piece of folded up card!</p>
