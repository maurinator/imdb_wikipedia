<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is a fantastic classic movie of a classic fairy tale.The sets are amazing (none of this green screen crap!)The acting is fantastic. Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Robin Williams, and Charlie Korsmo do an especially good job.The adaptation is written very well. Instead of the boy who can't grow up, it's the man who's forgotten how to have fun, and be in the moment, like a child.The IMDb rating is way off. How the hell does Pitch Perfect, and rubbish like that do better? How? Because either this site is full of morons with no taste, or the world is, or more likely both...All negativeness aside, this is a great movie, if you haven't scene it, you're missing out.</p>
