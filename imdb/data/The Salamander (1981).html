<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A political thriller involving secret plans to re-create a fascist government in Italy. This film is chocked full of stars like Christopher Lee, Anthony Quinn, Eli Wallach and the whole parade is led by Franco Nero who does a top notch job as high ranking officer investigating the murders involved in trying to obtain these documents.They had some cash to spend on this film as you can see how elaborately furnished the interior shots are and most everything else.The film mostly has Nero obtaining facts from interview to interview and there is a few chase scenes but its not a tense thriller just really interesting. The actors were amazing. If you get a chance give it a watch.</p>
