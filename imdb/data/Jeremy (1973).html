<h1>Jeremy (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jeremy Jones is learning cello at an arts school in New York. At school he spots Susan Rollins, who practices for a ballet audition, and he falls in love on first sight. He's very diffident in nearing her, so he gets some help of his experienced friend Ralph. Susan's first impression isn't great, until she hears him play his cello. The movie paints a quiet image of him winning her heart and the development of their relationship.</p>
<p>Shy cellist boy meets upperclassman ballet dancing girl at school. They experience first-time love, then happenstance pulls them apart.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in the early 70's, when I was 15 or 16. I was living in Peru, at the time. There was a girl my age that I liked a lot, that I took to the movie and we both identified with the main characters. I remember that you could get the theme song (record, 45 RPM) under the title "Blue Balloon Song" or something along these lines, from a local record label. The theme song was very popular and was played often by the local radio stations for several weeks. I am tempted to track her down and ask if she still has the record. This movie was recently released in DVD. I watched it again after 30+ years. This time with my wife and children. It was a big hit at home. Simple but enjoyable plot, very entertaining, pretty clean movie for today's standards. I would recommend it for the whole family.</p>
