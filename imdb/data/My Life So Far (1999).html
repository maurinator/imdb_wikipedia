<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"My Life So Far" is based on a true account of life in a Scottish family between WWI and WWII.  It was filmed around Argyll, Scotland, and is certainly a beautiful movie to watch.The story is told from a 10-year-old boy's point of view.  His rather large family (8 or 10 children) live on the estate of his mother's mother.  His dad is a bright man but is a somewhat impractical inventor.  The single, rich uncle is threatening to evict them all when the matriarch dies.The story unfolds nicely, the father comes to grips with some of his faults, relationships are examined.  Music is well-integrated throughout the movie. It ends in a very satisfactory manner.This basically "slice of life" movie holds your interest and is overall very entertaining.  Not an earth-shaker, I give it a strong "7" of "10", meaning for me that it is better than 70% of the movies out there.</p>
