<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film was absolutely incredible! It was SO unbelievably exciting and suspenseful! I found myself shaking in my seat throughout most of the film!Paul Walker and Steve Zahn were excellent as Lewis and Fuller Thomas! Leelee Sobieski's character (Venna Wilcox) doesn't really do anything until about 45 minutes into the movie, but she still did a great job! She has proven, several times, that she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today! Ted Levine was brilliantly menacing as the faceless 'Rusty Nail'.John Dahl creates a world that is so frighteningly real, that it's hard NOT to get scared! This is one movie that you will not take your eyes off of! It basically keeps you 'nailed' to your seat. If you have not seen JOY RIDE, I highly (with a capital H) recommend that you do!</p>
