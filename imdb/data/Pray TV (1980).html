<h1>Pray TV (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A failing television station is bought out by a slick TV evangelist and starts making mountains of money in the guise of religious programming, but which is actually just an excuse to sell merchandise.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Imagine if you will... Dabney Coleman saves a floundering TV station (KRUD) by adding Christian themes to all of the same idiotic programming and changing the station's name to KGOD.  Never mind firing the guy with the ventriloquist dummy named `Woody', and they guy with beer in his coffee mug, and the guy sleeping behind the studio camera... Brilliant!   We get to see Marcia Wallace host a cooking show in fake-Spanish (add `o' to the end of each word) with sign-language interpreter (???), a young Paul Reubens as a gay,chain-smoking exercise show host, stained glass set pieces that look like they were painted by the local middle-school, an Elvis impersonator with a cross-shaped guitar singing "You better not make fun of Jesus Christ',  Coleman uttering the phrase `give away some of those crummy little Jap TV sets', Dr. John plays a revival, a nasal spray that fixes bad karma, and Devo. That's right, Devo (and not nearly enough of them) under the name `Dove'.      Pray that you find this little gem.  If you do, buy it, watch it 20 times, destroy it.</p>
