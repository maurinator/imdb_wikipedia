Bintou is determined to earn the money herself, but the only skill she knows is growing millet sprouts. She has to find the pots, and obtain sacks of millet from the storekeeper, while her husband continually sabotages her efforts.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This short film is about an African Woman who wants to send her daughter to school, despite her family's resistance. She fought hard and finally won. This short film is simplistic, but highly realistic. It serves more like a documentary, looking into the lives of the people in the relatively backward parts of Africa. I really like the ending. Bintou won her battle so beautifully. It is not easy to be different, and it is even more difficult to fight for the values you believe in when everyone else does not think the same. I found this short film very inspirational.</p>
