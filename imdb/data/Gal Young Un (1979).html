<h1>Gal Young Un (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gal Young 'Un centers on a spinster woman who lives alone in the woods of north Florida until she is swept off her feet by an opportunistic bootlegger. He marries her for her place and her daddy's money and her cooking and cleaning, which she freely shares. Inevitably, he shows his true colors in a variety of ways. One day he brings home a very young woman with clear intentions of keeping her as a mistress (a gal young 'un) in the older woman's house. Business takes him elsewhere and the two woman are left alone in the woods together to come to terms with their shared exploitedness.</p>
<p>Mattie is a widow living alone in the Florida pine woods. She has money, but never goes to town, never sees others, simply goes about her day as she had when her husband was alive. Along comes Trax, a smooth talking minor player in the bootleg business with high hopes of being a player.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was the author of this short story. Victor Nunez specializes in films about Florida people. In this film, which was shot in the piney woods near Gainesville-Ocala, many of the actors are expatriots from the Florida State Theatre troupe, The Hippodrome Theatre, in Gainesville. The historic interiors are authenticated by interpretation specialists of the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Home Historic Site, and the exteriors are also accurate to the place and time of the story. I cannot confirm the automobiles as accurate, but given the care for authenticity in other regards, these are probably accurate as well.</p>
