<h1>Earth (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The movie opens in Lahore of 1947 before India and Pakistan became independent. It is a cosmopolitan city, depicted by the coterie of working class friends who are from different religions. The rest of the movie chronicles the fate of this group and the maddening religious that sweeps even this city as the partition of the two countries is decided and Lahore is given to Pakistan.</p>
<p>England, having colonized India at its leisure, granted it independence with unseemly haste. Even its most outspoken nationalists were taken aback when Lord Mountbatten, the British viceroy, unexpectedly announced that the date for independence was a few months, not a few years, in the future. The British decision to pull out by Aug. 15, 1947, left a country with no orderly way to deal with the rivalries between Hindus and Muslims, and the partition of India and Pakistan along religious lines led to bloodshed, massacres and, as this film calls it, "the largest and most terrible exchange of population in history". "Earth" is a film that sees that tragedy through the eyes of a group of friends in Lahore, then in India, now in Pakistan. There are Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Parsees, even a Christian or two. They have lived side-by-side since time immemorial, and the more idealistic think that situation can continue. But as India has proved, along with Northern Ireland, the Middle East and Yugoslavia, many members of all faiths consider it no sin to murder a non-believer. The movie is about a young, brace legged, eight year old Parsee girl named Lenny, whose beautiful nanny, Shanta is admired by all the men in a circle of friends. She slowly comes to love Hasan, a masseur, who is Muslim. She likes, but does not love, Dil, known as "Ice Candy Man". Her life is pleasant in a wealthy Parsee household ruled by Lenny's kind mother and officious father. When a train of Muslims arrives at the local depot and all the passengers are found murdered, the various sects turn against each other, and the city is soon aflame. For Lenny, the trouble first appears in her Lahore home when a quarrel erupts between Mr. Singh, a Sikh neighbor and Mr. Rogers, a British Inspector General of Police, who have come to dine with her parents. Bitter words metamorphose into slogan shouting mobs and arson. Angry Hindus storm through Lahore one day, and angry Muslims the next. Still, it is all far enough away from Lenny's uneasy but untouched home where her mother, Bunty, teaches her to waltz and Ayah's crew of admirers continue to meet in the park as before. The once charming Ice Candy Man turns into a near madman, one of the many roaming the streets of Lahore with vengeance and murder on their minds. The Muslim Masseur, Hasan, the only voice of reason amongst Shanta's admirers, implores the group of friends to "stand by each other". A love affair between him and Shanta, blossoms amidst the carnage and Lenny is privy to this fragile relationship between a Muslim and a Hindu. A film which gracefully establishes the beauty of peace and crudely depicts the tragic loss of it, Earth concludes that the most painful kind of betrayal is that which occurs within the family.</p>
<p>This story revolves around a few families of diverse religious backgrounds, namely, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Parsi, located in Lahore, British India. While the Parsi family, a known minority in present day India, are prosperous, the rest of the families are shown as struggling to make a livelihood. Things change for the worse during 1947, the time the British decide to grant independence to India, and that's when law and order break down, and chaos, anarchy, and destruction take over, resulting in millions of deaths, and millions more rendered homeless and destitute. In this particular instance, Shanta is a Hindu maid with the Sethna (Parsi) family, who is in love with Hassan, a Muslim, while Dil Navaz loves Shanta, and wants her to be his wife, she prefers Hassan over him. This decision will have disastrous effects on everyone concerned, including the ones involved in smuggling Hindus across the border into India.</p>
<p>1947 Earth is shown from the perspective and memories of an eight year old Parsee girl Lenny. In the film it is said by one of the main characters: "Hindu, Mussalman or Sikh, we're all bastards. All beasts. Like that caged lion which scares Lenny baby lying in wait for the cage to open." A cage, whose opening frees the evils of murder, loot and kidnappings. In the film the opening of the cage is depicted with the Britishers leaving India and therewith causing tensions between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. Between these religious groups stands a Parsi family, who has to see how their friends are either fleeing or being killed. In all this hatred the tragedy of the Hindu servant Shanta is embedded, who is equally loved by Dilnawaz and Hasan. These three characters provide a reflection of a maddening society, where friends become enemies and are even prepared to kill each other.</p>
<p>It's 1947 and the borderlines between India and Pakistan are being drawn. A young girl bears witnesses to tragedy as her ayah is caught between the love of two men and the rising tide of political and religious violence.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I find it quite ironic how 2 countries who separate due to their religion status; deals with it thru defying their religion (killing people, torturing people, etc).  But it happened, and the people living at this time amongst this chaos, has stories that they need to tell.  Like an anecdote from some animosity or experience that they need to alleviate themselves from by writing books.     This movie is based on the fiction novel "Cracking India," by Bapsi Sidhwa.  And although this book is fiction, it is based upon Sidhwa's life experience.  The adaptation of this book, "Earth," is very much alike this book.     The movie is about a young girl, Lenny, who has polio.  She cannot play with and like other children, so she spends all her time with Shanta (Ayah), who takes care of her like her own mother.  Lenny, is from a Parsee family.  Parsees in India, have always been invisible within the time of the Muslim and Hindu uproar.  They do not get effected by the war; Parsees are very wealthy.  Yet, Shanta is Hindu; and during the division of Pakistan and India, Lahore remains on the Pakistan side.  Yet Shanta doesn't want to leave Lahore, because she had been w/Lenny's family for a long time; and she felt safe within a Parsee household.   Yet she is beautiful and is loved by many men; most importantly, by 2 Muslim men.  Yet, before Partition really causes problems, Lenny, Shanta, and the two men who love Shanta, are all together as friends.  They did not see or predict how the environment at that time would change them all; and destroy their friendship.  But it did.      "Earth" has very graphical images of the horrors during Muslim and Hindu riots.  It made people angry, it made people want revenge.  There were children who were lost, because their parents were killed by a Muslim or a Hindu.  Is this justice?  The movie seperates revenge from justice.  Justice isn't revenge, because the actions taken aren't just.      A very good metaphor that keeps me thinking and thinking in the movie.  This is when Ice Candy man tells Lenny why she is afraid of the lion in the cage; Its because the lion wants to come out it wants revenge, it wants to be free, but once the cage is open, what would happen? Lenny in the end of the movie asks, "who's guarding the lions?" Ice Candy Man answers "nobody."  This is symbolic to how no one was controlling this bloodshed between the Hindus and Muslims.  Once the cage is open, revenge and hatred comes out; this is the price for their freedom.      I liked how the narrator was Lenny, why?  (Besides the fact this is based on Sidhwa's book).Because she is a young girl, she just turns 9 years old.  What she experiences in this movie is not supposed to happen to an 9 year old.  She is young, but in the end; she becomes an adult; she has seen and gone thru what innocence isn't supposed to see.     The anecdote?  Well if u see the movie, you'll see why this time and the politics at this time affected this girl at her stage in life.  The everlasting regret and feeling that you have betrayed someone so close to you, because of a tragedy effected by the actions and response by people about the Partition of Pakistan and India.</p>
