<h1>Sands of the Kalahari (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A small airplane crashes in the sweltering deserts of southern Africa hundreds of miles from civilization. As parallels are drawn between the stranded group of seven passengers and a nearby pack of savage baboons, one of the men's survivalist nature gets the better of him, as he decides his chances of survival would be better if the other men were eliminated one-by-one.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As you can read from others here, "Sands of the Kalahari" is one of those movies that if you saw it as a kid you're likely not to have forgotten it. It's also a good movie if you like to look at lots of shots of the desert (think: the beginning of "Planet of the Apes" [1968]) and people sweating. The plot concerns a small group of people that crash their plane in a remote area of South African desert.  No one comes looking for them, so how are they going to get out?  One is a woman, the rest all men.  You can guess that things get tense and then mean.  It make matters worse there's a nasty bunch of baboons living nearby and they look hungry.  Why this has never come to video I don't know.  The last place I saw it was on A&E some nine years ago.  It was shot in Panavision, so it should be letterboxed.  It was a Paramount film, so maybe if enough request to them are made it'll eventually come out on DVD.</p>
