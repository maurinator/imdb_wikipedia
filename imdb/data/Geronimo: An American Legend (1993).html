<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One of the many films which are overlooked,  the stark portrayal of the American Army couldn't  have been more refreshing. While we are  constantly exposed to the goodness of our  forefathers, at least this film proved to be a little  diligent to a true portrayal. Anyway, this film was  excellent in the scope of its cinematography,  scope and powerful script. Sadly, while Jason  Patric has done little to enhance his career  since this film, at least he shined for a few  short moments, particularly in this movie. Wes  Studi's performance as Geronimo was superb,  adding depth to the legend which few people  have only heard about through old wives tales  and abridged history books. Robert Duvall and  Gene Hackman were both excellent in this film.  I also felt Matt Damon was excellent in this film,  further giving precedence to the idea of him  being a superior actor to his terrible actor-friend  in Ben Affleck. A Truly excellent movie.</p>
