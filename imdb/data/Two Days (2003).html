<p>Paul Miller, a self-described "failed actor," sets out for his final act and his ultimate role. The last two days of his life ending with his suicide on tape. He tries to reunite with old friends and family members to say one last final goodbye, all of whom attempt to coax him out of killing himself or dismiss his intentions as a joke.Paul Rudd never goes below a certain level of acting ability, which is why he's in so many movies. The big negative in this movie is that the secondary characters are not especially good actors and it brings the movie down.The movie runs the gamut from funny to dark and depressing, which also is a bit unsettling because you don't know what to think. There is also a real lot if filler material like introducing the crew -- who care? What you really mean is you couldn't come up with enough appropriate footage to fill a feature film.And therein lies the rub. We're interested in Paul but get a lot of the bad acting secondary characters. Also odd is that this is a video tape record but it sure looks like film. I could be wrong.In the end, the movie is brought down by way too much filler and bad acting. Oh, and a cop-out ending we were promised would not happen.</p>
