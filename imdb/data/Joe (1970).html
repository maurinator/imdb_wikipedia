<h1>Joe (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Bill, a wealthy businessman, confronts his junkie daughter's drug-dealing boyfriend; in the ensuing argument, Bill kills him. Panic-stricken, he wanders the streets and eventually stops at a bar. There he runs into a drunken factory worker named Joe, who hates hippies, blacks, and anyone who is "different", and would like to kill one himself. The two start talking, and Bill reveals his secret to Joe. Complications ensue.</p>
<p>Joe was loosely based on a real event. In the movie, which takes place in New York, Bill's daughter is living with a drug dealer. One day, she overdoses and her father goes to the drug dealer-boyfriend's house to confront him. During the ensuing fight, he kills the drug dealer. Afterwards, he goes out and walks around, finally ending up at his neighborhood bar. Going in, he admits to the bartender, Joe, that he had just beat a man to death, then says he was just kidding. Later, watching the news, Joe and his wife see the story about the drug dealer being beaten to death and he makes the connection. Calling Bill up, he congratulates him for his act and they decide to meet for dinner with their wives. They find that they agree on a lot of things, especially how disgraceful hippies and drug dealers are and what a bane on Society they are. Meanwhile, Bill's daughter leaves the hospital, and returning home unannounced, overhears her father talking about killing her boyfriend, and runs away. Later, Joe arranges for Bill and him to meet up with some hippies and party. During the party, the men steal the drugs that Bill and Joe brought, along with the dead drug-dealer's wallet. Bill and Joe beat one of the girls present until she tells them that the men hang out at a commune upstate. With Joe providing rifles, the two men go to the commune.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Joe" is one of those movies where, although you think that it might go along smoothly, ends up hitting you like...I can't come up with an analogy. It showed not only that America's long-standing idea of unity was moot, but also the various aspects within our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate flower child, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a clean-cut executive. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend. In the immediate aftermath, Bill gets acquainted with Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right-wing, rabidly racist working stiff. As a result, the two of them end up associating more and more with the hippies, whom Bill finds unpleasant and Joe outright hates. But in the end, everything has dead serious consequences.True, some parts of the movie are a little bit dated, but it's a good juxtaposition of America's two sides during the Vietnam War. And rest assured, the residual effects of all that will probably never go away.</p>
