<h1>Dogora (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Several satellites have been destroyed without explanation. A few days later, a group of diamond thieves are thwarted when the gems they are after suddenly disappear. Strangely enough, the two incidents are connected when scientists discover that a giant jellyfish like creature, which was mutated due to a high amount of radiation hovering over Japan, is drawing up all carbon based matter, including coal and diamonds. Soon the creature is also attacking bridges and ships. Can anything be done to destroy the creature before he begins drawing up all mankind?</p>
<p>The Earth is attacked by a giant jellyfish monster from outer space that, for some reason, has a sweet tooth for diamonds.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In space, a big jellyfish destroys a satellite. The thing then comes to Earth and uses its twisting tentacles to get everything in its path. Buildings, trucks, and even a bridge get lifted up from the ground by the thing. The thing also has a craving for diamonds. Also involved in this mishmash are some diamond thieves who only want a truck of diamonds and a day to the beach without getting stung. Pretty interesting with imaginative special effects. The American print is terrible,dark, and scratched up. The dubbing is also bad.</p>
