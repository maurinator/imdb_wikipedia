<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movies in 1961. I've never before or since been touched so deeply by a movie. Simply stated it's my ALL TIME favorite movie... The cast was superb especially Leslie Caron. I thought she should have won an Oscar. The music is still my favorite sound track. The cinematography was gorgeous beyond words. I could go on and on, but who couldn't when talking about their favorite movie of All TIME.</p>
