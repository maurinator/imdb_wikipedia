<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Biographic movie about the American composer Sigmund Romberg.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is a curiosity more than anything else. Like most of MGM's alleged composer biographies, it distorts the details of the composer's actual life (in this case Broadway operetta composer Sigmund Romberg), but hangs all of his magnificent songs on an all-star coat rack. And there lies the attraction: seeing Gene Kelly in his only on-screen appearance with real life brother Fred; Jose Ferrer performing with real life bride Rosemary Clooney (in all of her stunning beauty); and his friend and business compatriot Helen Traubel trilling away-- most effective in the beautiful and uncluttered "Softly" and the lush "Aufwiedersen" for the ears of a dying Merle Oberon (was librettist Oberon supposed to have a crush on composer Ferrer?). Also choice is Ann Miller's Charleston tap dancing (and she looked great in that red dress); and super-babe Cyd Charisse in an 'Arabian Nights' ballet with James Mitchell (maybe the single most erotic dance performed on film): "One Alone--" in an incredibly sexy, nearly all-lace gown.</p>
