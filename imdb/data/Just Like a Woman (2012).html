<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mona (Golshifteh Farahani), 26, an immigrant from North Africa, runs her in-laws' mini market in Chicago. She's married to Mourad, a man who can't stand up to his authoritarian mother. Mona is harassed by her mother-in-law because after five years of marriage, she hasn't been able to get pregnant, something that's considered a shame and a taboo in her culture. Marilyn (Sienna Miller), 29, is a receptionist at a computer repair company. Her marriage with Harvey is on the ropes. The only thing in her life that makes her happy is her belly dance class, a passion shared by Mona. Dancing at family gatherings lifts her spirits up and makes her forget the misery of her daily life. Marilyn shops at Mona's mini-market. They've become friends. One morning, Mona's mother-in-law is found dead in her bed. Mona realizes that she mixed the wrong dose while preparing her medicine. Realizing that she might be accused of murder, Mona runs away and flees Chicago by bus. Marilyn loses her job because of the recession. When she gets home, she finds out that her husband is cheating on her. With nothing left to lose, Mona decides to go to Santa Fe to enter a contest hoping to join a famous belly dance company. Mona and Marilyn run into each other on a rest area on the side of a highway. They decide to continue the trip together. They cross the USA, pitching their tent in trailer parks and in the middle of the desert. They earn some cash belly-dancing together in restaurants and bars. Back in Chicago, Mona is considered a fugitive; she's wanted for the murder of her mother-in-law. Harvey asks the police to look for Marilyn who disappeared without leaving a trace. Will Marilyn succeed in joining the belly dance company? How long will Mona be able to keep her secret from Marilyn? And how long will she be able to escape the law?</p>
<p>Two women get on the highway heading to Santa Fe. Marilyn dreams of winning a contest held by a famous belly dancing company, while her friend, Mona, has a secret: she's a fugitive from justice - accused of her mother-in-law's death.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not sure why Rachid Bouchareb would make such a movie. The guy's been involved in some heavy-duty historical projects that have been very well-received in the past. Why, Rachid, why?For some reason, all his movie magic goes right out the door in this uninspiring and impotent road movie featuring a Golshifteh Farahani, in her usual affected demeanor (deep, slow and tragic voice, and the big dark eyes that never seem to blink) entirely devoid of any charisma, a Siena Miller who's trying to save the scenes on her own, and some of the worse performances (lines are spoken artificially and thoughtlessly) from just about everyone. The fact that Bouchareb would hire a French actor like Roshdy Zem (who's otherwise a great actor) is evidence that somebody either lost a bet or had to repay a past favor. Zem is awkward speaking in English and his performance is none the better for it.Farahani was magical and arresting in The Patience Stone. She had a lot of presence when she shared the screen with Di Caprio. Her performance is a fail in Just like a Woman, as is Bouchareb's directing. Nothing to see here, keep moving, folks.</p>
