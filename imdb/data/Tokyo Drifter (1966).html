<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>How do you take an average Yakuza script in a conservative studio wholly interested in profit and turn it into the perfect movie?  You give it to Seijun Suzuki, that's how.  Suzuki masterfully molds the tale into a deep and powerful look at Tetsu's struggles.  While the imagery, camera angles and color effects are brilliant, they never overpower the core of the movie. And to top it all off, Tokyo Drifter exudes 'cool'.  Tetsu, the primary character, is perhaps the baddest man in all of Japanese film, the Asian Shaft, if you will.  Be forewarned, this film is not for everyone.  It is bold and cunning in almost every way, and it's often jumbled presentation requires concentration and/or multiple viewings.  Life changing for me, anyone should give it a look.</p>
