<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In hindsight I should have watched this before Foxy Brown, as this was the better movie.  However, it seems that Foxy is far more memorable, with it's over-the-top violence.  This one's pretty violent as well, and has all the Pam Grier scenes that you'd expect.  Coffy offing a drug pusher in the first few minutes, having a touching family moment, fighting a room full of women that results in everyone's top being janked off, some bad guys nuts getting blown off (literally, not figuratively), and, of course, Pam trading blows with at least 2 lesbians at once.  Still, this one has a little more integrity than Foxy, being that it was made first and was a little tamer. Check out Sidney Freidman from M*A*S*H as a sleazy bad guy! This movie passes the time quite nicely.</p>
