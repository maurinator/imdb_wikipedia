<h1>Up 'n' Under (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The Cobblers Arms have been the best and most feared Amateur Rugby League team for the past ten years. Ex-pro Arthur bets their boss that he could train a bunch of deadbeats to defeat them in a local rugby sevens tournament. But to do so he must first get them into shape with the help of the very attractive Hazel Scott.</p>
<p>The rich and successful manager of The Cobblers Arms, the most feared side in the Northern pub seven-a-side league, persuades Arthur to become involved in a seemingly hopeless bet to train a team of deadbeats, The Wheatsheaf, to play against his team. Arthur readily accepts the challenge before realizing what a mammoth uphill struggle it would be! A chance meeting with Hazel Scott, a fitness instructor with her own gym, gives him an idea and between them they have just eight weeks to persuade, cajole and bully the reluctant, drunken layabouts of The Wheatsheaf into a team capable of beating The Cobblers Arms, something which hasn't been done for ten years. Will they be able to do it??</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I dunno about anyone else but when I saw the shower scene of Samantha Janus I could not stand up! She has an amazing pair of breasts!! Neil Morrisey is a very lucky man walking in on Sam Janus naked in the shower...boy I wish I was in his shoes because I would of joined her and soaped her up. She defo should of got her kit off in Game On, that was a great show and she looked gorgeous in that as well. Shes still looking good at 36 years old in Eastenders. Overall Up'N'Under is a great film and Neil Morrisey is absolutely hilarious in the film the way he turns around to her in the shower and says "Thanks" haha!! What a legend!What does anyone else think on the shower shot?</p>
