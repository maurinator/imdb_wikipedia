<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When i was little, about 6 years old, this movie used to come on TV all the time (T_T *boo who* then it stopped). I never seen the TV show before then but i saw 1 episode. The Episodes and the movie were good. I love how the movie was like a full version of the episodes which is really good especially for the kids who never seen the shows. The songs were so catchy. If you didn't like them YOU'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS ISSUES! I especially loved Plutiflikation, What shall I do today, and Recipe for life. I still sing them now. This must be and amazing movie for me to remember them from so long ago. This movie is a wonderful children's movie. Point Blank. (I'm not a child anymore and i still love the songs)</p>
