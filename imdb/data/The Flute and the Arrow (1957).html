<p>I saw this film in high school and have been haunted by it ever since. Beautiful photography.  Hard to believe the actors in the movie were acting, it seemed so real.  As I recall, it's the story of how, when natural order in the jungle is changed so that a tiger becomes a maneater, the leading character goes after the tiger and, in the end, is killed.  He was also a flute player which is where the title comes from, "The Flute and the Arrow." There's a lot more to the movie than what I'm mentioning.  It's definitely worth seeing.</p>
