<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There were times when any of us walk into IMDb, click on certain movie only to find that the rating was way underrated, and for this case I am afraid I am on that unease position. Only last weekend that I got the pleasure of watching this movie once again on blue-ray after the first viewing more than a decade ago and it certainly still hold its charm and value very much.First, when I say that this movie was underrated, I don't really blame anyone who might be disappointed or mislead by the fact that this movie very much suggest itself a mainstream supernatural horror movie but instead turn out to be more likely a psychological horror and thus gave a low rating to the movie. I can understand that this whole thing is part of market strategy since by the time of this movie being made horror genre are booming in Asian market and the producers might feel the urge to slip in even the slightest of a horror gesture. Yes, one can safely assume so.Back to the film itself, I am very much agree this was not a film for everybody. The pace was slow but never boring, it was mainly focus on three of our main characters throughout the movie. One is a taxi drive who was on the surface seems like a very decent and nice guy, second is a young and attractive woman who was a regular victim of domestic violence and third is a dime novelist with a work on progress to score his one hit wonder. All of three with their own dark and unpleasant past and all of three share the same creepy and slum apartment building. You are going to have a hunch from start that things are surely gonna turn nasty.The pace flow so slowly that it was more like a character study instead of a story. You can see how they joy and anger, their bright and dark side, their frustration, desperation and at certain point you might even be attempted to think that there might be supernatural involved. After all, some evidences strongly suggest that somehow our main characters were involved or part of the horrible past occurrence in that same apartment building, is it possible or it is all but cruel coincidence? In the end the movie left you with no blatant explanation, and just as confused as the main character might be, you are to take on your own interpretation.Final say, I strongly recommended this movie to any fans of horror and thriller genre. For once in a while you gonna find something precious among dirt. this is it!</p>
