<p>A crooked lawyer persuades his brother-in-law to feign a serious injury.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If I had to buy a single movie showing Walter Matthau's genius as an actor, this may be the one, for as good as Jack Lemmon always is in a movie, Walter shines here as the shyster brother-in-law lawyer, and the Best Supporting Oscar was awarded to him rightly for this role.  Matthau, always the man who acted through sicknesses went through a heart attack during this one.  The scene that he runs up the stairs after receiving the settlement check, a keen eye could notice that he is thinner at the top of the stairs.  That was because he shot that scene after his attack. This movie begins the long association with Lemmon/Matthau.  The next movie was to be "The Odd Couple".  What a great bunch of entertaining movies they were.  And this was the first one.</p>
