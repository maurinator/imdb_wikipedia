<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Crimes of the Century: The Siege at WACO (2013)David Keresh was considered Jesus Christ by himself and many of his followers. The ATF and FBI didn't see him as that but instead of a con artist, which is what led to a 51 day stand-off between them and the Branch Davidians, which took a disastrous turn when the compound burst into blames on that final day killing over seventy people including numerous children. This documentary from CNN uses archival footage of the event, new interviews and various messages from Keresh to tell the story of what happened that day and what impact it had a couple years later on the Oklahoma City bombing. History buffs aren't really going to learn anything new by watching this film but if you're unfamiliar with the events then it's fair to say that you're going to get a good idea of what happened over those 51 days and you're also going to get a good idea of the mistakes both sides made. The documentary, as with the others in the series, is extremely well-made and there's no question that it's highly professional. The look of the thing is terrific and it's clear that a lot of effort went into it.7/10</p>
