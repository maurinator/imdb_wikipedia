<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is probably the best of the series.  Things that I liked about the movie: The kids grow up and if there's something enjoyable, it's that they kept most of the members from the first two.  So watching their lives just make us warm and fuzzy.  It's funny watching the hijinks of the team as the college seniors make life hell for the Ducks and vice-versa.  Plus, we see the team try to adjust training under a new coach.  The hockey games in this movies are always fun to watch.  What I didn't like: We don't see enough about the new coach to make us care about him and the way he commands the team. I give this 4 of 5 stars.</p>
