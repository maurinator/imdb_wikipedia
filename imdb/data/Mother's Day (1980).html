<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I like this movie.  When I was a teenager and I first saw it I loved it. Of course then I was enthralled with gore fests.  This movie is definitely gory but when I was 13 the satirical vibe was somewhat lost on me.  You see Mother moves her two "mama's boys" to the woods.  Where she can take what is good from the city and leave the rest behind.  What is "good" are all the things you see on TV from Fonzie to breakfest cereals.  The house they live in is a marvel of production values.  Two thirds of the budget alone had to have gone into decorating the house.  It certainly didn't go into the Special effects.  Such as the shoddy moment of blood spattering before decapitation occurs.  As early 80's slice and dice goes this far outshines the typical camper in peril scenerio.  We are introduced to the three main (victims) characters and we even get meaningful flashbacks in their lives. This makes it a little harder to take when they are brutalized.  All in all Mother's Day ain't Life is Beautiful but why would you be that aisle of the video store unless you wanted to see some inbred choke on Drano.</p>
