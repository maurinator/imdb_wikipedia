<h1>It's a Bikini World (1967)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>As soon as he sees her for the first time, Mike Samson, the big man on his southern California beach and the object of desire of any girl on the beach, knows that he wants Delilah Dawes, who is in the area visiting their mutual friend, Pebbles. Despite Pebbles' assertions that Mike is a great guy, Delilah finds him arrogant and conceited, and flatly rejects his advances. After Mike secretly overhears Delilah tell Pebbles that she would rather date a modest, serious boy who doesn't necessarily have to be a star athlete like Mike, Mike decides to conduct an experiment to see if Delilah is true to her word or full of hot air: he will masquerade as his serious, quiet, studious, uncoordinated and bespectacled "brother", Herbert, who in reality does not exist in any form. The ploy works as Delilah starts to date Herbert in order to bring him out of his shell. Mike's ability to pull off the masquerade is hindered by his roommate/Pebbles' boyfriend, the dimwitted Woody. Complications ensue when Delilah questions why she never sees Mike and Herbert at the same time, when Mike starts falling for Delilah despite his initial intention purely to show her up, and as Delilah starts to fall for Herbert who doesn't really exist. So if/when Delilah finds out the truth, will Mike still get to keep the girl?</p>
<p>Chauvinist Mike Sampson wants to add burgeoning feminist Delilah Dawes to his harem. However, she wants nothing to do with Mike, so he decides to pose as his nerdy, imaginary brother Herbert to get her to fall for him. In the process Mike falls for Delilah and now must find a way to reveal the secret without losing her.</p>
<p>Male chauvinist Mike attempts to get an intelligent burgeoning feminist Delilah into his harem. When she resists, Mike then poses as his brother Herbert, but in the process falls in love with Delilah.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>So much fun weirdness going on here...the plot is pure '60s cornball but the actors are game and there are a lot of strange subtleties to appreciate: The Pop Art feel of the film, from the comic book opening titles (this was made at the height of the Batman craze, after all) to the Warhol/Lichtenstein style artwork hanging on the walls (pretty ahead of its time...I want a pad just like Mike's!) -- Veteran horror actor Sid Haig as an Ed "Big Daddy" Roth type -- The Crispin Gloveresque "McSnigg" character -- Bobby "Boris" Pickett of Monster Mash fame playing the goofy sidekick Woody (?!?!) -- Nice musical performances, more imaginatively photographed than in most films of this sort. The Animals' "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place" is a highlight -- Not to mention beautiful sunny locales and lots of bright, 1960s colors. If you enjoy beach party films, give this one a shot!</p>
