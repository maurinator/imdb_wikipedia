<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie in the LAST drive-in theater in my area in June, 1981 (I was 17 and already had my own car). I didn't care about what movie I saw, it was just a night out with (wow, what WAS her name?)...anyway, I found myself interested with Don Stroud's excellent performance of the cop, Seth, and his vengeful, jealous treatment of Quaid's main character. He was spot-on. I have known too many men like this character; obsessively jealous over his girl, overly vindictive in any wrong they feel slighted by. The music was okay, the acting was good (although, in fairness, Miss McNichol did have a long way to go at this point, and has since proved herself marvelously)...but the power-crazy cop who beats up his nemesis brutally in the bar did the movie for me, especially after the triumphant, gloating grin he says to the girl "let's go..." and she dumps him there and then. His reaction to this was also priceless. Not a fabulous movie by any stretch, but not a bomb either. Very enjoyable.</p>
