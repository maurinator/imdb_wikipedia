One day, her face is burnt in a fire in her house, she becomes sensitive to light and uses a china mask to protect her face against light. When two children are not found in the town, Matilda is blamed by the population and burnt in a fire, as if she were a witch.

<p>In the 1800's there was a woman that little children would take their old teeth (ones they had recently lost) to in exchange for a gold coin. A few years later, tragedy struck her, first a fire in her house which caused her to not be able to go into any type of light, and then she was hanged. There's a story that goes around the town of Darkness Falls about her, and she's called the Tooth Fairy. The story goes that she can't go in the light, and if you wake up and see her, she'll kill you. The usual saying is "Don't Peek." Well, there is a boy named Kyle who gets a warning from his friend Caitlin to not peek. Well, he wakes up on the night when the Tooth Fairy is supposed to come and get his last tooth and sees her. It all leads to more tragedy and the movie jumps to 12 years later. Now grown up, Caitlin calls Kyle because her little brother Michael is going through the same things he did as a boy, and wants his help. Kyle goes back to Darkness Falls to face his past, and the woman in the porcelain mask (aka the Tooth Fairy).</p>
<p>When he was a young boy, Kyle claimed that while he was sleeping, he accidentally woke up and saw the Tooth Fairy, who tried to kill him. Since then, he was considered crazy by everyone in town, except for his childhood girlfriend, Caitlin, and her younger brother. But now, Hell is coming back as that black haired, winged creature of doom that Kyle described is coming back to town. And she's not leaving without Caitlin's brother...</p>
<p>A vengeful spirit has taken the form of the Tooth Fairy to exact vengeance on the town that lynched her 150 years earlier. Her only opposition is the only child, now grown up, who has survived her before.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>In this horror flick the tooth fairy is evil and it comes for children when they lose their last tooth and then it kills them (or others) if they look at it. Chaney Klay plays a young man who once survived a tooth fairy assault that killed his mother and now he returns years later to help his old girlfriend (Emma Caulfield of "Buffy" fame) and her young brother who are now being terrorized. The logic of the storyline comes and goes as eventualy the tooth fairy causes a power outage in the town (seems it doesnt like light!) and starts reducing the population pretty quickly. The film does have its share of scares and decent moments, but the performances are weak and the plot leaves little room for character development so we move quickly from plot point to plot point to death scene. GRADE: C-</p>
