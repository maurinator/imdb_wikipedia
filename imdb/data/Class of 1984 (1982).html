<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Class of 1984(1982) is trash at it's best. Punk kids running the schools, driving the teachers crazy. An idealistic teacher (Perry King) tries to change all that. But like all people who share his ideals in movies, they always run into a couple of bad eggs. This time "Teacher" has several of them,and their leader (Timothy Van Patten) who enjoys making the faculty go crazy. Everyone except "Teacher", he's from the "there's no such thing as a bad kid" school of thought. Boy, is he wrong. When those two bump heads, it's show time!! Over the top acting and mugging coupled with huge amounts of sleaze and bloody, bone crunching scrapping makes this one a winner. Check out the very young and pudgy Michael J. Fox! Roddy McDowall co-stars as a teacher who's seen way too much. One scene from this classic was shamelessly ripped off in 21 Jump Street!?Highly recommended for cult fans.</p>
