<h1>Avenging Angel (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Molly, former baby prostitute "Angel" from Sunset Boulevard, has managed to leave her street life with help of Lt. Andrews. She studies law at an university and aims to become attorney. When she learns that Andrews was shot during a failed observation by brutal gangsters, she returns downtown to take revenge. She frees Kit Carson from the old people's home and together with the other old friends she tracks down the bad guys.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As with THE SISTERHOOD, ALIENATOR, THE ASSAULT, LADY TERMINATOR, and this lame flick, they prove why you can never trust a box cover! If you really want to get into deadly, lethal passion without the useless nonsense, my suggestion is for you to grab a one-way ticket to China on board the TWA. There, you will find what you want. Remember, your very life depends on it!Am I the only one trying to preach? Never mind! All of us don't even care!!!</p>
