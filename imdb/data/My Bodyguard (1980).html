<h2> Summaries </h2>

Faced with all the stress that role entails he makes his situation worse by insulting Moody, the leader of a group of toughs who extort lunch money from kids. These punks pretend to be bodyguards for the kids to protect them from Linderman who, it is rumored, killed his brother in cold blood. Clifford befriends the sullen Linderman and hires him as his bodyguard. When Moody ups the ante, Linderman must decide whether fighting for what he believes in, with his haunted past and image, is justified.</p>
<p>When a boy comes to a new school and gets harassed by a bully, he acquires the services of the school's most feared kid as a bodyguard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie rings true on so many different levels. I find this a real gem because no matter how many times I watch it I find it compelling and refreshingly straightforward. Chris Makepeace is cast perfectly as a reluctant victim of extortion by Matt Dillon's high school band of thugs. Adam Baldwin relays a sense of pain, anguish, and grief that you can nearly touch. What can you say about Matt Dillon (Moody)? Anyone who has ever been bullied will squirm in their seat after watching him for just ten minutes. This is one of those special movies that will appeal to so many different people. Haven't we all been to high school? been bullied at some point? got caught up in ridiculous rumor and innuendo? if so, then definitely take time to watch this timeless classic.</p>
