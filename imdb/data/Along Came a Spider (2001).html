<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just finished watching this movie and really enjoyed it.  It is one of those movies where if you walk to the kitchen for two minutes, you probably missed something important.  It leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the course of the movie.   The only flaw that I have with the movie is the decision to use special effects in the first few minutes of the movie.  These special effects with the car were not very "special" at all.   In fact, it was so unrealistic looking that it was borderline pathetic.  Fortunately, this only occurred in this one scene.  However, the scene with the thermos (as to not give anything away) was excellent and extremely creative.  Morgan Freeman did his usual brilliant job of acting.   If you like a good suspenseful thriller/mystery, this may be a good choice for you.  8.5 Stars.</p>
