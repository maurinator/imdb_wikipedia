<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Put up your hand and than catapult it down, and say "bah!" to this film. An extremely weak film, that is based upon some old, already used clich√©, you know "terrorists taking over, one man army, bunch of hostage", this time in the mountain hotel. Well... yahoo.We got Thomas Ian Griffith (Karate Kid 3, Vampires) as a leading action man, but he looked here like he didn't give a damn for this film. He was even slow in martial arts scenes, he can do faster than that, but when you're doing a low budget film... what's the point? Christopher Plummer is here! What a hell? A great, classically trained actor to appear in such low budget crap as a leading villain? I don't understand... what is attractive to such great actors in low budget films? We also have Nastasja Kinski... well, she was OK.There isn't much to say about this crap film. Except... you can watch it if you want to... fall asleep for example.</p>
