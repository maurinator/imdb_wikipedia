<h1>Desert Hearts (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>It is 1950s Nevada, and Professor Vivian Bell arrives to get a divorce. She's unsatisfied with her marriage, and feels out of place at the ranch she stays on, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Cay Rivers, an open and self-assured lesbian, and the ranchowner's daughter. The emotions released by their developing intimacy, and Vivian's insecurities about her feelings towards Cay, are played out against a backdrop of rocky landscapes and country and western songs.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>with a nice sound track (I love Patsy Cline). It has a good feel for the period in which it takes places (the late Eisenhower years.)The theme of a lesbian coming to terms with her identity, as in this movie, is still relevant today - for a lesbian or gay man. And it is great to see finally a gay-themed movie that is NOT exploitative (like all those kinky lesbian vampire flicks) and has a happy and "gay" ending!</p>
