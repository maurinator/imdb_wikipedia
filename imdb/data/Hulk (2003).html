<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's late, so I'll just bullet point my thoughts.1.  Hulk as CGI - works most of the time, some of the time it doesn't.  Nobody can argue with that.  But, like Gollum, the expressions of the face and the fantastic body language made you WANT to believe. Unlike Gollum, some of the shots just don't work at all.  The big CG breakthrough for this movie - the manipulation of real settings was just SPECTACULAR.  I fully belived that San Fran was getting torn apart.  2.  Too long.  Cut a half hour.  3.  The comic book style - hit and miss.  4.  Most of my friends hated the movie, yet.....  5.  ..... I found many of the scenes to be incredibly moving, which took me by surprise.  Though I secretly hoped that the Hulk would just be ICE Storm with Hulk in the Joan Allen role, I have to admit that Lee pulled off one helluva feat.  I sympathized more for the hulk than the entire MATRIX cast (of both movies) combined.  And I'll take a faulted movie with emotion over almost any big budget vehicle any day.The L Man</p>
