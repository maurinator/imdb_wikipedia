<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>...this would be the greatest movie ever!!! Well I've got to hand it to those kooky Bollywood (ahem) film makers. Their (gasp, choke) expertise had provided the world with another perfect example of why stock footage is a great thing. Actually this movie is 2 1/2 hours long and at least 40 minutes of it is special effects footage lifted off the American Superman film from 1978, and I have to admit that they are by far the best scenes in the movie. I don't speak Hindi, but a friend of mine does, and we asked him to translate the film for us. He left after 20 minutes crying that it didn't make any sense to him either. I felt sorry for him, but it actually lifted the rest of the film up the scale of "so bad, it's good" theater. This is really actually pretty good, and the random English lines help to both entertain and confuse the hell out of me. I guess that this film is an acquired taste, if you don't like things like "Plan 9 from Outerspace" or "Gymkata", or even the Batman TV series from the 1960's then don't expect to like this, but if you love bad effects, acting, and cheesy costumes, get a copy and watch Superman Indian style.</p>
