<h1>Mitchell (1975)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Joe Don Baker is Mitchell- a hard-nosed, soft-bellied cop with an affinity for porn and Schlitz. His latest assignment has him engaging in no-speed car chases, yelling at children, shooting innocents and sloppily carousing Linda Evans.</p>
<p>A sleazy, incompetent detective tries to simultaneously take down heroin dealers and a socialite who murdered a burglar.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Awful.  Gloriously, fabulously awful.  My-my-my-my goodness this was a piece of work...  If the hideousness of this movie had been intentional, I doubt it would be so amazingly funny.  I laughed so hard I almost passed out. What I wouldn't give for "Mitchell 2: the Geritol Years."</p>
