<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This has absolutely got to be one of the best movies dealing not only with World War II, but also with the Holocaust.  It tells a most incredible and almost unbelievable story with so many amazing twists of fate for young Solomon Perel.  It is one of the few films that I feel puts a very personal face on what it was like during WW II.  If you know German you will find the actual German dialogue to be particularly fascinating, especially the scenes in the elite Hitler Jugend school. The line where he says, "I was very confused..." is the understatement of any film ever made. I consider this film a "MUST SEE" if you are a member of the human race. If you are a student of German or of German history, then it is even more than a "MUST SEE"!</p>
