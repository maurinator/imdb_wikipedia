<h1>1991: The Year Punk Broke (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>David Markey's documentary of life on the road with Sonic Youth and Nirvana during their tour of Europe in late 1991. Also featuring live performances by Dinosaur Jr, Babes In Toyland, The Ramones and Gumball.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Forget how MTV and the media portrayed Sonic Youth & Nirvana, or typecasted all their featured friends from the northwest...this is honest a look as you could get of content veteran rockers Sonic Youth and some of the last care-free days of Nirvana.  Hilarious behind-the-scenes stuff, great live performances, and hell...they even threw in the Ramones! Right up there with "The Decline of Western Civilization" as far as punk documentaries go.</p>
