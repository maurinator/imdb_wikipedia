<h1>I Am Dina (2002)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In Northern Norway during the 1860s, a little girl named Dina accidentally causes her mother's death. Overcome with grief, her father refuses to raise her, leaving her in the care of the household servants. Dina grows up wild and unmanageable, with her only friend being the stable boy, Tomas. She summons her mother's ghost and develops a strange fascination with death as well as a passion for living. Family friend Jacob encourages Dina's father to hire Lorch, a tutor who introduces her to the cello. When Dina is old enough, she marries Jacob and moves to Reinsnes, a port he runs with his mother, Karen, and his stepsons Niels and Anders . Niels doesn't like Dina's wild ways, or the fact that she has taken over accounting duties at Reinsnes. Dina's eccentric tendencies become even stronger, eventually leading Jacob into an accident of his own and bringing Tomas back into her life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am Dina is intended for mature people. If you like drama and if you like too see strong scenes, odd people and good actors in a movie that does not resemble anything from Hollywood, or any other movie for that matter, then you should watch this movie.The acting is very good throughout. The fact that the dialogue is in english and the actors are not english native speaking does not matter, unless you are a sissy.The norwegian landscape is very dramatic and the photography is absolutely breathtaking. Usually I do not even comment on the photography, because I think the story is more important, but the photography in I am Dina is really impressing.This is a movie you will not forget.Rating: 8 / 10, according to the IMDb rating system of course. If the ending would have been as strong as the beginning (really strong) my rating would have been even higher. Why do people here invent their own rating systems?</p>
