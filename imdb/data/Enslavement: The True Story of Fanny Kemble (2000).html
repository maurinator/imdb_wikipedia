<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I normally don't watch made for TV movies, but this one happened to be just coming on as I walked by the TV. I sat down for a few minutes to see what it was about, and the next thing I knew it was two hours later! Jane Seymour did a fabulous job portraying Fanny Kemble, whom I had unfortunately never heard of before this movie. What a truly amazing, brave woman she was. She is an absolute inspiration. I found Jane Seymour's performance very moving and convincing. Although some of the dialogue was a bit too contrived, on the whole it was a very good movie.</p>
