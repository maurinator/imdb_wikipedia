<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Honestly, one of my all time favorites. A true classic! Brilliant performances by Anil Kapoor and Vijayshanti, including Asha Sachdev. The characters make you fall in love with them, and relate to them. You can actually feel their pain. Worth every moment! A must see movie! A good tribute to the mentally challenged, showing that when faced with situations they prove their competency. A real-life outlook to the world as opposed to the usual reel-life cinema approach. It makes your heart go out to the characters, especially with the excellent dramatization by Anil Kapoor, one of his BEST performances ever. Vijayshanti too, once again proves her credentials.</p>
