<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Once again, we find "Too Sweet" struggling against his conscience, and the bad guys, to gain his freedom.  After defeating his arch-rival, and gaining freedom: "Too Sweet" works himself into championship contention...he's reunited with his sister, who is married, and has a young son.  As fate would have it...he must fight against the same man he defeated to end the first movie.  Now, they each have risen in the rankings. You'll find the plot thin, the acting pitiful, and get a good laugh for nostalgia's sake..  You'll notice Mr.T, Ernie Hudson (the warden on "Oz"), and a few others...have your buddies over, break out the beer and enjoy. Its true entertainment value is how thinly veiled the plot and characters are. This movie, was BIG...back in the Blaxpo days.  Essentially it rode the wave of the original.  Leon Isaac had no talent, physique, or legitimacy as an actor.  But , he did what most successful films do...run a sequel to milk the audiences thirst.</p>
