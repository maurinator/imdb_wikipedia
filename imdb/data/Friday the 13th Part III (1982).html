<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>dont ask me why, but i really really enjoyed "f13:part3". even though it can be cheesy, it also has some great scares and terrifying chills. part 3 doesnt really depend on "on-screen" blood and guts, its more about the killer watching and waiting and not going around cutting peoples heads off and blood splattering on the walls. part 3 is also famous for introducing jasons hockey mask. to me, part 3 is A MASTERPIECE. ITS THE BEST 3RD MOVIE TO EVER BE MADE FOR ANY MOVIE SERIES...</p>
