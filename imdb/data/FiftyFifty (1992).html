<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I agree that this movie IS a some kind of parody on action flicks. The heroes gunned down numerous troops without any difficulties, yet they always throw out jokes, as if they were not serious doing that. Unfortetunately, IF this was meant to be a parody, it's not funny enough. In the end, it has become a usual heroic-flick where you can blast a whole army, common in the 80s and early 90s.I've never seen Robert Hays in any real 'tough-guys' movie. From the first I saw his name on credit, I was practically sure...that this is not "Commando" or somethin' like that.By the way, I have to straighten some things up here. The movie takes place in a fictional SOUTH EAST ASIAN country, not South America or else. In fact, "Tenggara" (or Tengara, as the movie put it) means "South East" in Malay and Indonesian. The soldiers and the natives spoke Malay all through the movie, and the movie was shot in Malaysia. Yeah, I knew it's a relatively forgotten part in the (Hollywood) world (except now there's a movie called "Entrapment"). In real life, there are only three countries using Malay (and its variation, Indonesian) as official language: Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalaam.Anyway, worth watching though...if you like some mild jokes. For the rest, don't think.Or as a viewer put it: leave your brain.</p>
