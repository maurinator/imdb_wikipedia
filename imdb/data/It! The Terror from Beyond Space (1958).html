<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 1973, the first manned expedition to Mars is marooned; by the time a rescue mission arrives, there is only one survivor: the leader, Col. Edward Carruthers, who appears to have murdered the others! According to Carruthers, an unknown life form killed his comrades during a sandstorm. But the skeptical rescuers little suspect that "it" has stowed away for the voyage back to Earth...</p>
<p>An Earth rescue expedition goes to Mars to rescue an earlier mission and finds only one survivor, the expedition leader Col. Carruthers. He is under arrest and will face a court-martial on his arrival back on Earth. No one believes his fantastic story of a Martian monster that methodically killed all of the members of his crew, one by one, until only he was left. On the return trip however, they realize the monster is on board and living on the lower decks. It begins to attack the crew who quickly become concerned about their own survival.</p>
<p>The first manned expedition to Mars is decimated by an unknown life form which stows away on the rescue ship.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When you first watch "Alien", you soon realize it is a remake of this movie, and you know how to get rid of the monster. But if you've never seen either movie, you probably would be as much on the ropes as the characters. In both cases, a space crew happens upon a hostile life form which infiltrates their space ship. No longer a haven from space, the astronauts try every means to kill the invader and save their lives (because the monster is killing them at will), and nothing seems to work. The basic difference is, of course, the special effects, which are paramount in the "Alien" movies, but nondescript in this movie. The robot and other automated features provided by the "company", seems to be actually at fault for all the carnage in "Alien." In "It!", the creature pretty well does it all on his own. Minor difference at best, because both movies are about thrills and adventure, and both succeed. An advantage of black and white film representation with little or no special effects is that it doesn't have to prove as much, and there is no exorbitant information for the viewer. It's more of a dream state where the information provided is the information needed. In the modern colorful world, it is too much for a viewer to fend off extra information in most movies. There again, both "Alien" and "It" capture the essence of what they try to achieve. And if you like one, I'm sure you'll like the other.</p>
