<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When Filumena Marturano arrives home looking very very sick, close to death, everyone gets shouting, very worried and then send for Domenico Soriano, her lover. He comes to her deathbed, thinking that this is the last time he will see her, after more than twenty years of relationship...From that moment we have a very funny and quite accurate view of how relationships may work. It all starts maybe a little bit slow, but don't worry, because the movie is full of twists, surprises, fights and a great interpretative duel between Loren and Mastroianni. Everyone does an amazing job, but this is Loren's show, and she shines throughout it, from the poor and scared girl to the mature woman she becomes.It is all a little bit old fashioned in cinematography and direction, but this is a movie where what matters are the actors and the dialogues, and it delivers. On top of that, it is a small piece of information about twentieth century Italy.Well worth watching.</p>
