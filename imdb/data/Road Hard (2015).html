<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A few people have written outstanding critiques about this film. As far as Adam's acting, he seemed as if he wasn't even in the moment of what was happening. He seemed as if he was distracted and/or exhausted possibly due to his other projects. I know that his character is actually tired of everything in his life anyway, but Adam delivered everything in the same monotone manner even when his character's life was improving.Also, when I was in film school I received outstanding advice: never let a low budget movie LOOK like it's low budget. I never felt as if I was watching a well-produced feature film.It's just a below average effort to me. I like some its messages such as the pull of L.A. versus a more "normal" lifestyle, which I'm experiencing myself now anyway. But I laughed at this thing only once, and I wasn't in it for the drama.</p>
