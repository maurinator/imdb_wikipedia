<h1>Court Martial (1959)</h1>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I recall to have seen this years ago and it was quite depressing. 3 Navy sailors are picked up by a submarine after their cruiser (ref to Battleship Bismarck ?) was sunk by the British in the Atlantic. They are the only survivors coming back and at first celebrated, then they fall victim to a fanatic and detail prone Court Martial Attorney who finds out, that they abandoned ship before (if ever) the order to abandon ship was given officially, constituting the fact of desertion from quarters, an act punishable with death. That the ship was already hopelessly shot up, communication severed and nothing left to fight with doesn't matter. Don't know in who's reel cellar it is now, but would like to see it again.</p>
