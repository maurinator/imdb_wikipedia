<h1>The Trial of Joan of Arc (1962)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A reconstruction of the trial of Joan of Arc (based entirely on the transcripts of the real-life trial), concerning Joan's imprisonment, interrogation and final execution at the hands of the English, filmed in a spare, low-key fashion.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There are only a handful of films that have engraved themselves in my memory indelibly.  This is one of them.  First, it is in black and white, and I find it impossible to imagine how this particular film could have been done otherwise. It is perfect.The close ups of Joan, testifying in the ecclesiastical court setting, were devastating.  Whether this film mirrors history perfectly is irrelevant. What I saw on screen was a portrayal of absolute sincerity that, for me, exemplifies the highest human ideal.  The dialog was spare -- not one extra word -- and the photography was flawless.  I don't know whether Florence Carrez (Joan) has acted in anything else -- I think maybe not.  But I suppose if she ever considered doing so, this would have been a nearly impossible performance to follow.</p>
