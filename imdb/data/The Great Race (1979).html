<h1>The Great Race (1979)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alex and Louie engage in a friendly competition to see who can take in the most money. If Louie wins he gets a date with Elaine.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Who's the more productive cab driver: good guy "Alex Reiger" (Judd Hirsch) or bad guy "Louie De Palma" (Danny De Vito)? Yes, Louie is the dispatcher but he used to be a cabbie - and a great one, according to him, of course. One early evening, Louie challenges Alex and the bets are all made, including a funny one involving "Elaine" (Marilu Henner) who will have to go out on a date with the despicable dispatcher if Alex loses.What happens during the night with the two cabbies and their various fares is very funny and varied. You never know who's going to enter either of these guys' cabs and what will happen. I won't give anything away.I think fans of this series will find this to be one of the more entertaining episodes of Season Two, which says a lot since this was such a great TV show.</p>
