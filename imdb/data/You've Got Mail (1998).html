<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It was hard not to give this movie a 10, but since I have only given out about 20 10's in all the movies I have ever seen - thousands, a 10 here would have been a little too generous.Though, it is difficult to find fault, I suppose it is fair to say that the movie didn't always have full steam - especially early on. Still, even during those times, it was interesting. I mean, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. What else do you need?Additionally, I didn't laugh very much. Not that I was required to, but this genre would, after all,  be considered a romantic comedy. Despite the lack of laughs, it was as feel good as it gets.The movie was blessed with two great actors, a creative idea, excellent writing and directing. And, the ending was one for the ages. I might have chosen to "tweak" it a little, but it was about as good as you will ever see assuming you like romance. I do!</p>
