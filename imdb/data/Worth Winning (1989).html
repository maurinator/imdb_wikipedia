<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Here we have a good old boy who makes a simple little bet with the boys that he can sweet talk 3 broads into marrying him within 3 months. He treats them very nicely, wines and dines, asks no special favors....it's just a wager among men. Unfortunately, he is found out and all hell breaks loose. We then see what vindictive, ugly creatures women can be when things don't go exactly as they demand. Cool comedy with Harmon doing a super job playing the sophisticated, yet downtrodden, weatherman with a heart of gold. Loved the way he kept addressing the camera with his views on the way things were progressing.</p>
