<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is the greatest episode of Buffy I have seen so far. The plot of the episode is intriguing, compelling, and so interesting that I don't think I can ever forget it. Also, for once, the actors don't over-act and actually portray the emotions that the characters would feel with complete honesty. Alyson Hannigan is the best actress of the show. She gives an excellent performance in this episode demonstrating the simple charm that makes her characters on TV/in movies so likable. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who I think is an average actress at best, gives a surprisingly deep performance. I also appreciate the character development of the characters Buffy, Giles, Angel, Spike, and Cordelia from the pilot up until this episode.The tone of the episode is also something quite worthy of admiration. The plot developed so wonderfully and remained intact the entire episode. I usually feel that episodes of Buffy have great premises but carelessness ruins them. The plots are usually either fallacious, underdeveloped, stretched, or ruined in some other way (whether it's with minor mistakes or gigantic plot holes). However, this episode did not have much of that - or any that I can think of. The tone is delectably exhilarating and so appropriate to the plot. The music adds to this tone and makes the episode even more amazing.This is not an episode of Buffy to miss. It is one of the greatest, and I'm sure as I progress through the show I won't change my opinion about this episode being among the canon.</p>
