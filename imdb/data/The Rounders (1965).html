<h1>The Rounders (1965)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Ben and Howdy are a couple of aging cowboys who bust broncos out of Sedona for Jim Ed Love, a slick operator if ever there was one. Sisters, Meg and Agatha, have their eyes on Ben and Howdy, but the boys aren't ready to settle down yet. They spend the winter in the high country corralling more than 100 stray cattle at $7 a head for Jim Ed. Most years, they blow their winter pay in one spring night at a Sedona bar, but this year, Ben and Howdy have a plan: to take an ornery roan that Ben has been unable to break and bet their bankroll that no cowboy at the Sedona rodeo can stay on the horse. What will they do if they win - marry the sisters or head for Tahiti?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is truly the number 1, modern cowboy "cult" movie.  The film captures the true life of a modern day working cowboy.  All aspects of this film are the most realistic and true, day to day accounts of the REAL cowboy.  The mundane, humor, drama, suspense and romance of the American Cowboy are captured in The Rounders.  A must see!</p>
