<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A wry and lighthearted look at the U.S. Navy in 1941. Cary Grant and Tony Curtis shine amongst a wonderful supporting cast in this fictional story inspired by an actual incident that occurred during WWII.  So many war movies are depressing, while others are completely ridiculous.  This film, while full of sexual innuendo and lighthearted humor, still manages to keep it's humanity, with one foot planted firmly in the reality of the Pacific theater.A jaunty tale of an injured sub, a few army nurses, a group of lonely sailors, and some pink paint. The direction is above par for the time period and genre, the writing is bright and witty, even for today's standards, and the performances are thoroughly entertaining.  This is a recommended must-see for fans of Curtis and Grant. Grab the popcorn and soda and enjoy!  I give this charming 1959 classic a 7 out of 10.</p>
