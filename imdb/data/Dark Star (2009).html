<h1>Dark Star (2009)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Oscar is not pleased that the remainder of his team, already a bit jealous of Gupta, who gets to address a spies conference in Southern France, only gets to fetch a polarity reversing device for safekeeping by Frank. He sends them 'off duty' when he learns that Colt Winchester, a nemesis since his graduation, has been sprung from MI9's special jail by two cahoots. The kids find out on their own, and are joined by Gupta, who wondered why the base computers weren't manned, to take on the fiendish trio.</p>
