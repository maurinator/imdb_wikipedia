<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Drifter Chance Wayne returns to his hometown after many years of trying to make it in the movies. Arriving with him is a faded film star he picked up along the way, Alexandra Del Lago. While trying to get her help to make a screen test, he also finds the time to meet his former girlfriend Heavenly, the daughter of the local politician Tom 'Boss' Finley, who more or less forced him to leave the town many years ago.</p>
<p>Self-professed to be from the wrong side of the tracks from St. Cloud, Florida, Chance Wayne loves Heavenly Finley, the daughter of wealthy 'Boss' Thomas J. Finley, a corrupt and ruthless politician who rules the town. Thomas does whatever he needs to to break the two up, and manages to run Chance out of town. An aspiring actor, Chance rolls back into St. Cloud with temperamental and drunken Alexandra Del Lago, a once great movie actress whose star has since faded. Picking her up at a party, Chance sees Alexandra as his professional meal ticket. Chance is back in St. Cloud to try and get back together with Heavenly, who still loves Chance but will not cross her powerful father if only to save Chance. Boss wants to run Chance out of town again, but it will be a little more difficult this time if only because of the notoriety of Miss Del Lago. The fortunes of all involved may hinge on some secret information concerning Chance and Heavenly.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Even with some of the seamier elements removed and with the tweaks in the storyline, this film has great value due to the acting of the principals. Newman stars as a would-be glory boy who has repeatedly failed to make a success of himself and has been reduced to playing gigolo to various wealthy women. Page is a deeply troubled actress on the downside who gets dragged with him to his home town when he plans to get an "in" in Hollywood through her, thus convincing his old sweetheart (Knight) that he worth leaving her family for. Unfortunately, Knight's father (Begley) and brother (Torn) have not forgiven Newman for the fallout from one of his previous visits to Knight. The main thrust of the drama concerns the animosity between Begley and Newman and the balancing act he must maintain with the weary, neurotic Page. Widescreen viewing is a must even though the bulk of the film takes place indoors or on sets. Newman is excellent throughout and the film is offers a rare exploitation of his physical charms (attributes he often fought against during his earlier career.) Page is wonderful, running the gamut of emotions and investing her character with loads of quirks and moments of interest. Knight does very well, though her role is primarily decorative. Begley took home an Oscar for his bellowing, overbearing, vulgar portrayal. Also scoring are Torn as the son trying unsuccessfully to impress Begley and the always interesting Sherwood in a rare sexy role. Dunnock turns in a typically worrisome, effective performance as a Newman supporter. There are two small, but intriguing, gaffes in the film. In one scene, Begley and his cronies are watching a newsreel in a room filled to the brim with smoke, yet (because the image was superimposed later) the screen never has any smoke in front of it. Later, Newman "lights" his cigarette off an oil lamp, yet it doesn't light. He visibly notices this and does his best to cover it. Some of the symbolism is heavy handed (check out the wacky opening!) The film may disappoint devotees of the original play, but it's polished production and memorable acting turns make it a strong piece of work.</p>
