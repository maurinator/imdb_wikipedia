<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Superman is one of those comic icons that cannot seem to appear in a really good movie or a good video game. It has to burn him up to see how successful Batman is as he has been in some good movies and two really good games at least. Granted the original two Superman movies are rather good, nothing else has been 'super'. The best game I have ever played with Superman is a Nintendo game where Superman looks all small and it is not a really good game, but it was sadly a lot more fun than this game and most others I have played featuring the man of steel. Perhaps he should get a better agent? The best representation of Superman I have seen is Superman the Animated series. This game is based off that one so it has to be good right? No, no, no and no. This game was released on the Nintendo 64, the worst of the Nintendo consoles released here in North America not including hand-held units. Not saying it was all bad as the Mario game was good on it, the Zelda games are classics, but all to often games would be of this quality on it. Also, it also seems to be a console completely devoid of traditional role playing games. That is my favorite type of game, and I do not recall playing any on this system and I cannot think of any that were released on this one...the Zelda games being the closest thing, but they are considered adventure. So what to say about this game? Well, most people never get beyond the horrid first level where Superman flies through rings as this is the ultimate challenge the fiendish Lex Luther could think of. My friend apparently never could get passed this, you should of seen the look on his face as I made it through the first time. Not only did I make it through the first set of rings, I made it through the first level. His response was hilarious being something along the lines of, "How the INSERT CURSE WORD did you do that?" I then made it to some horrid sewer level or something and promptly quit. The game is just ugly, nearly unplayable and I just do not believe they could not make a cool game based on the very good animated series. The graphics are the 3D block looking type with no textures or anything. Looks like you are watching that Dire Straits video, only the Dire Straits video looked more detailed. Later I would play Superman Returns, the game based on the mediocre movie and it fared better than this, but it to was a disappointment. Poor Supes just seems destined to never be in a good game.</p>
