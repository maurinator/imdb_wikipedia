<h1>Chief Crazy Horse (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>When young Crazy Horse, of whom great things were predicted, wins his bride, rival Little Big Man goes to villainous traders with evidence of gold in the sacred Lakota burial ground. Of course, a new gold rush starts despite all treaties, and Crazy Horse becomes military leader of his people. Initial Indian victories lead to the inevitable result. Uniquely, all is told from the Indian perspective.</p>
<p>This biography of the famous Lakota Sioux war chief is told entirely from the Indian viewpoint.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Typical for its time, this is a well-intentioned biography of (as it states) "one of America's greatest generals".  Real Indians appear in the background, and, like they were in Ford films, they are great scene-stealers. Victor Mature, Ray Danton, and Suzan Ball are quite good. Better-than-average script, but the action scenes are only fair (it was not an expensive movie, and it seems that the violence, especially in Custer's last stand, is underplayed to accentuate War as a necessity and not a pleasure). Good Remingtonesque photography, filmed in the Black Hills.</p>
