<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie was enjoyable to me before I knew anything about Elmore Leonard's writings.  The underlying story is made into a very watchable movie by the director and involves a ruthless but insightful gunman being held for subsequent transport by train which will take him to prison.  The job of guarding him is taken on by reluctant guard. This temporary guard is a civilian who takes on the job only because he desperately needs the money to save his farm and family.Typical of Leonard stories, the main characters have strengths and weaknesses not at first evident but when these traits become evident they are significant factors in the outcome of the story.It is an intelligent movie which is great to watch.  I highly recommend it.</p>
