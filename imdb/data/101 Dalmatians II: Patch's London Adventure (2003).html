<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Roger, Anita and their canine clan are packing for the big move to Dalmatian Plantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far from the clutches of Cruella DeVil. The feistiest pup, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and longs to be a one-of-a-kind wonderdog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However, the family move will interfere with Patch's opportunity - until he's accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's "trusty" sidekick, Lightning, reveals that the producers of the show want to replace Thunderbolt with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A veritable reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella DeVil - she's back and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, she's able to calm her frenzy through an affiliation with a spot-fixated artist.</p>
<p>Being one of 101 takes its toll on Patch, who doesn't feel unique. When he's accidentally left behind on moving day, he meets his idol, Thunderbolt, who enlists him on a publicity campaign.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Man, I am not a big fan of Disney sequels of the old classics, but today I watched the DVD feature of this "101 Dalmatians 2: Patch's London Adventure", and I was amazed! The first quality of the film is its storyline. Great. Concrete and funny facts makes it easy to understand and enjoy. The animation is not as brilliant as Disney's best, but it is nice, beautiful and comfortable for your eyes. And the voice work! Wow, one of the best voice work ever in my opinion! Bostwick does a great work as Thunderbolt, and Martin Short as Lars is just hilarious. The film has some songs, too: "Seeing Spots" with a touch of "Dalmation Plantation" (the end song of the first film, remember?) and "Try Again". "Seeing Spots" is just OK, but "Try Again" is totally great! It freaks you out, give you an anxious of singing together while you laugh with the movie scenes. Laugh! If there is a thing that you can't stop doing during the film is laughing! You laugh of Bostwick and Short great voices and you laugh of the jokes, great and lots of jokes. They play with the situations and also do some play with English lifestyle. The film is great. Watch it and you'll like..."and if at first you don't succeed, TRY AGAIN"!</p>
