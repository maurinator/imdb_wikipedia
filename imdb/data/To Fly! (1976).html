<p>The movie To Fly! is audience participate through believe.To Fly! is soul experience of human creation. People are amazing.The movie starts off with hot air balloon ride through a small town. The person on board almost hits a building.The balloon then travels over a river and warns a kayak of cliff ahead. The movie transition through various scenes, like with bi-plane and eventually jet then small rocket. I almost feel like I am part of movie, unique point of views.The best moment is a train. I will not spoil why or how.The movie is suitable for all ages. My parents took me at 5. Children might get frightened now and then but not scared.Do you a favor.
