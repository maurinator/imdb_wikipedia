<h1>Otello (1986)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Based on Shakesphere's play, Verdi's opera depicts the devastating effects of jealousy, "...the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds upon". Believing Otello has promoted the fast-rising Cassio over himself, Iago plots to destroy both Cassio and Otello. Iago convinces the jealous Otello that his beautiful wife Desdemona is unfaithful, and that Cassio is her lover. Jealousy is followed by tragedy, then retribution, "Has Heaven no more thunderbolts?"</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A real rarity -- an opera on film that still retains its power. In fact, this version is even more powerful that some stage productions. The subtitles are easy to read, the staging is atmospheric, and the cast is wonderful.</p>
