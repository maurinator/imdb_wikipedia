<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I vividly remember going to see this film shortly after it was released. I was a rather serious student and thought Heston was not a serious actor, so didn't expect much. However, for me, in the film Heston WAS Anthony - Anthony was a media star with fatal flaws and Heston must have understood that type. He was totally authentic - there may have been the American accent, but again, Romans to Greeks must have been like Americans to the UK - so Heston's portrayal worked. And I remember Hildegarde Neil as a very convincing Cleopatra -not histrionic but someone ruled by emotion. I thought and still think that the Burton Taylor epic wasn't a patch on this. Must get the DVD!!</p>
