<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Not sure what the point in ECSTASY IN ENTROPY is, but it was kinda entertaining watching girls get nekkid and fight and whatnot.The film starts out in black-and-white as bunch of strippers are workin' the club. A few get in a fight. Then some dude gets a blow-job and unloads twelve gallons of (simulated) spunk all over the strippers face. Some more tit-shots and then it abruptly switches to color and some chick is assaulted by a mask-wearing female who takes the other chick's clothes off. Nekkid girl ain't havin' it and tries to beat up masked-girl with her tits, and then tries to body-slam her or something. Fun stuff.I honestly kinda liked this one cuz the first part has a noir-ish, '60s B-movie feel to it. Nothing really spectacular, but a bunch of boobs and butts and stuff, so that's never a bad thing. More "stylish" than a lot of Zedd's other short-films, so I enjoyed it on that level...6.5/10</p>
