<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There's REALLY no words to say here. I'm so glad I saw this, it's just so LOL-hilarious. I ain't NEVER saw nobody make fun of Star Wars this way! I just gotta get this on DVD somehow. The funniest skit was probably the second one with the Vader/Emperor phone call. The Emperor just LOST IT on this dude!!! The 'Yo Momma' fight was great! George Bush's whole skit even the one with his daughter Jenna was OFF-THE-HOOK!!!! The fact that George Lucas actually appears in a skit in here (with his ACTUAL VOICE) was a big plus. That was a cool skit as well.Unbelievably funny! That's all.</p>
