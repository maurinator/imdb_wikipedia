<h1>There's a Girl in My Soup (1970)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>TV personality Robert Danvers, an exceedingly vain rotter, seduces young women daily, never staying long with one. He meets his match in Marion, an American, 19, who's available but refuses any romantic illusions. At first, her candor and cynicism put him off, but after he witnesses her breaking up with her rocker boyfriend, he's attracted to her and invites her on an idyllic two-week trip to France. Slowly, she pokes holes in his artifice and he comes to care for her. When they return to London, with the press thinking they're married, they come to a cross-roads: go back to their old lives, marry each other, or invent a new, open relationship. Is Robert up to it?</p>
<p>At age forty-one, Robert Danvers is renowned for being an ego-maniacal celebrity chef and culinary critic who hosts his own London based gourmet food television show called "Good Taste". But he's equally renowned for being a womanizing cad who has a revolving door of women coming and going. He's met his match in a nineteen year old American named Marion, who picks up him up without knowing who he is or anything about his public or personal life. But she seems to immediately know what he's all about. She admits that she wants to stay one step ahead of him in their sexual game. Despite their bumpy start or perhaps because of it, she moves into his flat a day after knowing him and accompanies him on a business trip to the south of France. This being a relationship totally foreign to both, can it last, or will it last because it is different than all the previous casual relationships they've had up until now?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"My GOD but you're lovely."This is surely one of Sellers' most memorable characters. This guy HAS to have been a major influence on Austin Powers: he's an aging playboy, with hairy back and bad teeth, who never imagines that he's anything but irresistible to women. Goldie Hawn is the woman who won't give him what he wants when he wants it.The first hour is pure gold, some of the greatest comedy i've ever seen. Then it strangely begins to meander. Really badly. With the extended wine tasting journey, involving many pointless shots of Frenchmen drinking wine at what seems like a real wine tasting ceremony, and later on the pointless shots of scenery, very out of place in this story. I was thinking what terrific characters they were, and what a terrific comedy set-up we had here but at the point where it starts to wonder, you realise that they'd onlythought up these funny characters - but hadn't got as far as what to do with them. Thus, they also had no idea what the resolution, if any, should be. They seem to have figured that everything would work itself out once they started shooting - well, it didn't. The last half-hour is an absolute mess. I would have enjoyed it much more as a 60 minute movie, thankyou very much. As it is, we have a clumsy "resolution" scene that needed about seven re-writes, and a rather meandering, almost unnecessary last half-hour, peppered with a few good scenes (Sellers carrying Hawn over his shoulder in the lift), which unfortunately spoils what might have been one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. 6/10. The first hour is an absolute gem - i'd still recommend you see it for that.</p>
