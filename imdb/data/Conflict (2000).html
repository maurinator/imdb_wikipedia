<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Kari Wuhrer is the only reason I saw this movie!! The plot is unfortunately very sad. Kari tries to hold stuff together but the whole plot was a doughy! That was not the only problem with the movie however. The problem was with all the sidekicks hanging around. However, Kari looked good! the bad guy,Nash.. well.. nothing much to write about him except that he was OK.. probably second to kari! The computer graphics used in the movie did suck! Kari looked hot in the scene where she escaped from prison. But then, Kari Wuhrer always looked hot. The dialogue delivery was bad if not pathetic. The acting was cheesy! All in all, not the best of movies. But like I said, if u are a Kari Wuhrer fan, you can go ahead and watch it and admire her!</p>
