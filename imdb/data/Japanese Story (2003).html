<h1>Japanese Story (2003)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Against the background of an Australian desert, Sandy, a geologist, and Hiromitsu, a Japanese businessman, play out a story of human inconsequence in the face of the blistering universe. The end of the journey leaves no one capable of going back to where they started from.</p>
<p>Sandy, a geologist, finds herself stuck on a field trip to the Pilbara desert with a Japanese man she finds inscrutable, annoying and decidedly arrogant. Hiromitsu's view of her is not much better. Things go from bad to worse when they become stranded in one of the most remote regions on earth. Japanese Story is a journey of change and discovery for its two lead characters.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I may be one of only few Japanese who watched this film (as it apparently was not released in Japan and I got to know of this film in Europe). I have to say that the stereotyped description of the Japanese character is outrageous to the extent of humiliation. Those who produced this film should have been left behind the age of globalization. And the music, which many people are commenting on here, is not typical Japanese. Instead it is a well-respected traditional Okinawan song, which reminds most Japanese people of the tropical islands of Okinawa, away from mainland Japan. The way that the song is used in this film bothers me a lot given the noted value of this song. (The Okinawans would be offended more than I am.) As for other people's comments on shallow relationship, weak personalities, insufficient explanations, poor scenario, etc., I cannot agree more. Third-class entertainment movies for exclusive domestic consumption exist in any country, and I thought this was just one of them, but what shocked me most was that this film had even been awarded in Australia! Oh, please, I have seen some better Australian films before...</p>
