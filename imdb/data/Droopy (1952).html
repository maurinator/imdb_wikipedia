<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Droopy is south of the border, happily riding a donkey and singing. He's also playing the violin and wearing a big sombrero. Suddenly, out of a cactus tree comes a bandit you quickly rifles through Droopy's wallet. He stops when he gets to a picture of a gorgeous woman. Droopy says, "That's my girl. I am going to serenade her."The bandit replies, "No, I, the Crisco Kid, will serenade her. (Hey, the real Cisco Kid - star of the 1950s TV - is a good guy, not a bandit!). He sends Droopy away on his little burro and rides off on his big horse "Diablo" to get the girl. Of course, the moment The Kid arrives as the senorita's house, Droopy's already there.The rest of the cartoon is similar to others in that no matter what the "villain" does, Droopy is always right there, too. You cannot shake loose from this dog! Droopy is relentless.In a surprise, the woman gives him a big kiss, but Droopy only says, "You know what? That's not sanitary." You just never know what this dog will do, or say.The artwork in here was tremendous; beautiful, lush colors of the Mexican countryside and villas. There is plenty of music in here and wild sound-effects, too.</p>
