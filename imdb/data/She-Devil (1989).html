<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I liked this film. It's a dark comedy about revenge. Apparently it was a star vehicle for Roseanne, and I thought she performed well enough. Meryl Streep really sank her teeth into this role, probably a lot of fun for her, after so many tragic, accented heroines. True, the special(??!!) effects shot of Roseanne walking away from the exploding house was awful, but it was so bad that I wonder if it might have been intentional. If so, I can't understand why, though. One gaping plot hole. Ed Begley, Jr. As an average-looking guy (OK, below average-looking) I can tell you that Begley is not the sort of man that the Meryl Streeps/Mary Fishers of the world fall for on first meeting. Anyway the film is cute. Not great by any means, but worth a viewing.</p>
