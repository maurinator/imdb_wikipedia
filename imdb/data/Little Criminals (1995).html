<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Rarely do I find a film so moving! This film had me in tears towards the end and I have had a life that began a bit like Des's so social dramas' etc don't really affect me as though it might some people who have lived privileged or comfortable lives because i analyse but don't often become emotional through watching a film like i did with this excellent creation from Stephen Surjik and its' writer Dennis Foon and i will be trying to contact them to tell them myself (Never felt like doing that before!).I live in the UK and so my childhood didn't involve firearms, well not until I was 17 because they are quite rightly a lot harder to come by than in Canada, even then I discarded the pistol I brought after threatening somebody for running over a dog and would never own one again, I am now 39.This film had so many other parallels though that it was almost traumatic to watch and see how it mirrored myself, it was definitely painful at times as my stomach felt like somebody had just kicked me in it. Because of that I would have to say that it is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, period.The ending is tragic because of the way he isolated his self from the only person he felt he could trust will leave many who can identify with the film, numb. It did me.The character as myself was talented and probably very intelligent, I myself have an I.Q. of 142 but for years as a kid officials thought I was a retard and a write off because of the suffering in the familial environ and the fact I had disengaged and this comes through in the film when all the Police want to do is lock the little guy up but like all young kids, really needed to be understood not treated as though a criminal, as does the lack of permanence when he began to trust somebody when taken into care and although the film doesn't get into his future (I don't want to give too much away.) I know that is what it is like when one is moved through the care system and forming a bond in an environ where nobody actually cares that much at all as they are philanthropist, yes, but only doing a job at the end of the day, that betrayal and lack of permanent bonding with adults stays with you as a deep footprint. It is something that affected this lad, Des, profoundly when he wanted to stay where he had bonded with an adult he felt he could trust.I highly recommend this film to anybody interested in socio-dynamics, especially because although set in Canada I can say the dynamics are universal because of the way it mirrored my own.The guys who made this film did a really good job in hitting home subtleties in a powerful way.To answer the previous review. Remember it? I shall find it hard to forget because in a way I lived it, even looked a bit like Des when i was a kid!!! Sincerely.Paul. AKA DELTAPAN</p>
