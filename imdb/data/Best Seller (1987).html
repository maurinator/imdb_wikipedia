<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Hit man Cleve approaches writer/cop Dennis about a story for his next book: How Cleve made a living, working for one of the most powerful politicians in the country. To get the story right, they travel around the country to gather statements and evidence, while strong forces use any means they can to keep the story untold.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is disturbing.  Starts out almost as a "procedural" but grows more thrilling as you begin to discover what the Woods character really is. I identified with the Dennehy character, with his initial skepticism, and growing realization that Woods is what he said he is, and worse.  Woods nails the role, the psychopath with pride in his workmanship, with a three dimensional performance that is gripping and frightening.  Dennehy is wonderful in the complementary role.  The chemistry between them is exquisite.  I think this movie will, in time, receive more recognition.</p>
