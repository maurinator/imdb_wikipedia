<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A type of Film Noir, the audience knowing only part of what is going on till the end of the movie. A young woman going to the Paris Expo with her brother who disappears the next morning. Not only has he vanished but so has his hotel room. We believe her story but the characters in the movie don't. What's really happening? Can't give away anymore than that.Acting of Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde terrific. Can't complain about the rest of the cast either.Just saw the film again on cable, after writing my original comment ten years ago in 1999..Movie is still holding up as excellent with a most interesting twist at the end..I enjoyed it as much as ever... have seen it twice before.. To compare it to Hitchcock is like apples and bananas...The style of this film is totally different then a Hitchcock film---complete without any violence.</p>
