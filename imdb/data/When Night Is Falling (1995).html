<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Bought this film several years back.  It had played at several theatres during its first release but I never did get down to actually viewing this film.  When I finally bought the film and watched it, it definately went beyond my expectations.  Everything about the film was near perfect.  One could feel the emotions that each character was conveying on screen.  The film was beautifully shot.  The love scenes were incredibly erotic.  A near perfect film.</p>
