<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The nude bomb, an average film, does indeed have above average merit. It has excitement, it has a bit of a plot, and it does have some titillation, but not too much for children. It seems that the Get Smart guy is still the same old guy from the TV show...which is actually a good thing. There are, of course folks out there that will say that this is NOT a good film, and maybe that is true, but hey, it isn't a bad film either. It has a few very titillating moments as far as the action, and a lingerie scene that is not to be believed, either. A great film it's not. A fun and unique film it is. It does have value. Other films of the same time period and the same subject, just do not have the same pizazz as this one. The Get Smart guy is still a hoot to watch, it is a funny film, but the plot is definitely worthwhile, too.</p>
