<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Girls Next Door: Class of 1984 (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Actresses Lisa Langlois and Erin Noble discuss the making of CLASS OF 1984 in this 16 minute featurette from Shout Factory! Both actresses talk about how they ended up getting their roles and then they talk about various parts of the production. This includes discussing their co-stars, how the director would let them come up with new things for the film and what they think about the movie becoming a cult classic. It should come as no shock but this is another extremely entertaining featurette from Shout who continue to impress with these treats for the fans. If you're a fan of the movie then you'll enjoy hearing about the various production stories and it really gives you a good idea of what it was like on the set.</p>
