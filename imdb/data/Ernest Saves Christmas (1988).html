<h1>Ernest Saves Christmas (1988)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An obnoxious and bumbling but well-meaning man attempts to help Santa Claus find a successor. Failure wouild mean that there would be no Christmas.</p>
<p>Ernest P. Worell, a sweet but silly taxi driver who at times suffers delusions of grandeur, has just chauffeured a rather extraordinary fare: "His Great Red Oneness, the Claus" himself. It seems Santa hasn't got the magic for another Christmas season, and has come to Orlando, Florida for Joe Carruthers, the man he has chosen as his successor. But things quickly begin to unravel, thanks to Joe's meddling agent and Santa's increasingly unreliable memory. Incredibly, dimwitted Ernest soon becomes Santa's only hope! Joining forces with a young runaway named "Harmony Star", Ernest rushes to save the holidays as we know them.</p>
<p>Ernest helps Santa Claus as he searches for his successor.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I am 16.  When I was younger, I would watch this movie all the time at Christmas.  This, along with A Christmas Story and (Clark Griswold's) Christmas Vacation are the traditional Christmas movies.  It didn't get very high ratings, but these people are looking for action and intrigue, not just good holiday laughs.  I suggest you find a copy for your children.</p>
