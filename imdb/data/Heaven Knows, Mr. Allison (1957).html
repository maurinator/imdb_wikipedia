<p>In 1944, Marine Corps Cpl. Allison finds himself washed ashore on a small island in the Pacific. The only other inhabitant is Sister Angela, a Catholic nun who herself only arrived a few days before with a priest. They found the small village deserted and the priest has since died. Over time, Allison falls in love with Sister Angela, but theirs is a relationship that is not meant to be. Their situation soon changes when Japanese troops arrive on the island but Allison's presence proves essential when the US Navy attacks.</p>
<p>Marine Corporal Allison is shipwrecked on a Pacific island during world war II. The only other person on the island is a nun, Sister Angela. The pure nun and the rough-and-ready soldier have characters totally at odds at each other, but they gradually fall in love.</p>
<p>For different reasons, Irish Catholic nun Sister Angela and U.S. Marine Corporal Allison are stranded on deserted Tuasiva Island in the South Pacific in 1944, the island deserted due to circumstances of World War II. Calling each other Mr. Allison and "Ma'am", they are respectful of each other's vocation and of each other as people despite their extreme differences in backgrounds and outlooks. Despite a bounty of fresh food on the island (tree fruit and wild animal protein) and the hazards of the trek, they plan on using Allison's marine raft to sail 300 miles to Fiji. This plan is thwarted when the Japanese first bomb the island and second set up what looks to be a weather station on the island, forcing Allison and Sister Angela into hiding. When action in the Pacific Theater makes the Japanese leave the island as quickly as they landed, Allison suspects the Allied forces won that battle and will soon be doing their own recognizance in the area. Thinking that they may soon be rescued, Allison tells Sister Angela what is in his heart, especially in light of the fact that Sister Angela has not yet taken her final vows: he has for the first time in his life fallen in love and wants to marry her once off the island. Sister Angela tells him that she is already engaged to her life to God. Allison takes Sister Angela's answer hard. When the Allied forces don't show up, Allison thinks they may be stranded on the island forever, convincing Sister Angela to at least reconsider their collective lot in life. However, the war continues around them making the twosome take life one moment at a time for however long they will be on the island.</p>
<p>A marine and a nun form an unlikely friendship. The marine is shipwrecked on a Pacific island and the nun has been left behind there; they find comfort in one another as the two wait out the war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is among the best of my collection, when I like to see a good film, this is always in the first line. Robert Mitchum acted here extremely well as a marine with a very poor, not to say vulgar, background in his life. He confessed he was born orphan, he never knew who were his parents, and after 14 years old he escaped from the orphanage and was put in jail several times. His life changed once he was recruited by the US Marine. The always brilliant Deborah Kerr is here a nun with a very character and humor, always able to understand the behavior of Mr. Allison (Mitchum). It is normal that when two persons of opposite sex are together some strange feelings may appear, the mariner obviously may some hints in his favor, but the nun politely said no. In conclusion, excellent film with an interesting plot and wonderful acting, a real good film forever.</p>
