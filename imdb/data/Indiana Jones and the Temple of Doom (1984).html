<p>1935. At a swanky nightclub in Hong Kong, Indiana Jones confronts Lao Che, a Chinese gangster, for a trade - a reward in exchange for the ashes of a Ming dynasty emperor. The gangster's sons, however, won't let Indy get out of the trade alive, and a violent struggle ensues that snares up the gangster's moll, torch singer Wilhelmina Scott. Indy and Willie escape with Indy's pre-teen sidekick, Short Round, and fly out of Hong Kong - unaware their plane belongs to Lao Che and the two pilots are ordered to bail out over India. Indy, Willie, and Shorty manage to escape and wind up being greeted by a village elder who shows them the ruins of his village - ruins caused by the theft of three stones of great magic power, taken to a gigantic mountaintop palace. The palace, however, belongs to a peaceful young Indian prince who assures that no such action occurred from his palace. Indy, however, is attacked in his bedroom and finds a vast underground system of caverns that lead to an ancient terrorist cult long thought dead, a cult that has kidnapped the children of the village and is using them to dig for the magic stones. When Indy and his friends are captured they are to be sacrificed to the pit of molten rock, but a violent showdown begins that erupts into a savage brawl, gunfire, a mad mine car pursuit, the collapse of an underground dam, and a showdown at a rope bridge that threatens to kill Indy, his friends, and the cult.</p>
<p>After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, and stumbles upon a secret cult plotting a terrible plan in the catacombs of an ancient palace.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>All this endless quarreling about which episode of the sensational Indiana Jones trilogy is the greatest one seems so futile and pointless to me. Personally I love the whole classic series and it's been a highly important part of my childhood. There are only few films that has effect me as much when I was young. It's easy to notice that each Indy-film is downright brilliant yet refreshingly different from the other and could easily be the best of the three so why not just enjoy all without using energy to locate flaws and make comparisons. Terrific "Raiders of the lost ark" was of course the first and the original and therefore freshest one - the true and the genuine Indy-movie."Indiana Jones and the last crusade" had Sean Connery playing Indy's daddy and if you ask me "Indiana Jones and the temple of doom" is the biggest adventure of them all. I'm not saying that it's necessarily the best part because I don't want to put these movies in any order. I just happen to think that it's the biggest adventure film = it's more exotic, danger-filled and action-packed than the first or the last one. I've never thought "Indiana Jones and the temple of doom" as an over-violent movie, not even when I was a kid. So they rip a guy's heart out. That's cruel but this is only an old-fashioned fairy tale, a fantasy - not a gory horror picture. To pack it all up in one sentence: Among the biggest movie adventures ever.</p>
