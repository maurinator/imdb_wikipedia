<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>History records the Unites States purchase of Alaska on March 30, 1867 . This was the realization of a dream that began many years before , when captain Jonathan Clark anchored his schooner , The Pilgrim of Salem , among a thousand abandoned ships that lay rotting in the harbor of San Francisco , 1850 . There captain Clark (Gregory Peck) romancing women and smuggling pelts from Islas Aleutinas and Alaska , Russia . Along the way he meets and woos a gorgeous Russian countess called Marina (Ann Blyth) in 1850 San Francisco . As it deals with a salty sea captain, a beautiful Russian countess, and the love that would span an ocean . Events separate them, but after a breathtaking sea race to the Pribilof Islands against Portugee (Anthony Quinn) they meet again ; now , both are in risk from the plans of villainous Prince Semyon (Carl Esmond) and General Ivan Vorashilov (Sig Ruman) .This exciting as well as entertaining tale packs thrills , noisy action , spectacular struggles and lots of gutsy adventure . The flick relies heavily on a prologue in a San Francisco hotel , its results to be overlong and tiring . Brawling , sprawling , almost primitive action, teeming across the screen and being based on Rex Beach novel . Impressive images when the ships sail across thunderous seas and thrilling final when protagonists and enemies square off in a breathtaking climax . Raoul Walsh demonstrates a special talent for making the densest action sequences seem uncomplicated and uncluttered and his characters , like the scenes distinguished , often have an unfettered , raw power . Nice acting by Greagory Peck as roistering sea captain Jonathan Clark, who poaches seal pelts . Sympathetic interpretation from Anthony Quinn as rude as well as illiterate skipper . and a beautiful Anne Blyth as a countess who hides her noble origin , she does an enjoyable acting though didn't have a notorious career . Good secondary cast with familiar hearted features as John McIntire , Andrea King , Hans Conried , Rhys Williams , Brian Forbes and Sig Ruman . Thrilling as well as emotive musical score by the classic composer Frank Skinner . Colorful cinematography by Russell Metty , a nice cameraman expert on superproductions such as Spartacus , Sign of the Pagan , The War Lord , Counterpoint and Omega man . The movie was splendidly photographed on natural outdoors , Islands Aleutianas and Alaska through the courtesy of the United States Department of Interior National Park Service. The motion picture lavishly produced by Aaron Resemberg was well directed by Raoul Walsh . From his starts in the silent cinema he achieved successful films until the 50s and forward , early 60s , when he was less dominant , but is still stayed lots of lusty adventure , stories of comradeship and friendship , and Raoul makes the most of plentiful action scenes . Walsh was an expert director of all kind genres but with penchant in Western as ¨Colorado territory¨ , ¨They died with their boots on¨, ¨Along the great divide¨, ¨Saskatchewan¨, ¨King and four queens¨ , ¨The sheriff of fractured jaw¨, ¨A distant trumpet¨ ; Adventure as ¨Thief of Bagdad¨, ¨Captain Horatio Hornblower¨, ¨World in his hands¨, ¨Blackbeard the pirate¨ , ¨Sea devils¨ ; Warlike as ¨Objetive Burma¨ , ¨Northern pursuit¨, ¨Marines let's go¨ ; and Noir film as ¨White heat¨, ¨High Sierra¨, ¨They drive by night¨, ¨The roaring twenties¨. Rating : Fairly straightforward movie and above average . This interesting adventure and action film makes it of the finest of Raoul Walsh genre entries.</p>
