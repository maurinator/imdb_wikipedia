<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just love this movie. Just like another review on here said, to me it his kind of close to home. I've never been too lucky with the ladies this movie just seemed very personal to me. and while some i guess thought they weren't that great of a pair, i honestly loved the interaction between the two main characters. this is one of those "i really wish that kind of thing would happen to me" and it's a movie that i really enjoy watching to kind of "escape" for a little bit. i also think it is just overall a pretty good movie despite it's incredibly low rating. i think the three roommate characters are quite amusing, it has a lot of funny quotes and plot events, and a lot of the drama is good too. overall this is just in my opinion a very entertaining movie and it has a somewhat unique effect on me and will always be one of my favorites.</p>
