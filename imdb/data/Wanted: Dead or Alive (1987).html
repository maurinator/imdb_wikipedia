<h1>Wanted: Dead or Alive (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>This movie features a character who is a descendant of the character played by Steve McQueen in the television series of the same name. And like McQueen's Josh Randall, Hauer's Nick Randall is also a bounty hunter. & also an ex-CIA operative, who is asked by his former employer to help them track down a terrorist, Malak Al Rahim, who is in the country, and has already made a move. But he is also looking for Randall, and the people, whom Randall is working for, is telling Malak, where he can find Randall.</p>
<p>The former CIA operative in the Middle East Nick Randall is presently a bounty hunter in Los Angeles. He chases most wanted guys to get the reward and is saving money for repairing a vessel. He intends to retire and travel around the world with his girlfriend Terry and his best friend is Detective Danny Quintz. After a terrorist attack in a movie theater, Randall is assigned to catch the evil terrorist, Malak Al Rahim, who has killed more than 140 persons in his attempt. However, the real intention of his disaffection from CIA, John Lipton, is to use Randall as a bait to catch Malak. Terry and Danny are murdered by one terrorist and Randall discovers that the Malak's agenda is to blow-up a chemical facility and kill thirty thousand persons. But Randall now seeks revenge against Malak.</p>
<p>Nick Randall is a bounty hunter who's built up quite a resume. One notable resume highlight, though, happened before his current career began--as a CIA agent. Malak Al Rahim, an evil international terrorist, shows up on the scene and suddenly there is a new member of America's Most Wanted list. A deadly game of cat and mouse fine Nick as both the mouse and the cat-- but has Nick finally met his match?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Having only a passing tie to the late '50's/ early 60's Steve McQueen helmed TV show of the same name (Nick is Josh grandson or some such nonsense), this movie is a mean and violent little number has B-movie mainstay Rutger Hauer starring as Nick Randall, a tough talking, no nonsense, 'my way or the highway' type bounty hunter who comes out of retirement at the request of Benson..sorry I mean Robert Guillaume (who always has some of the best lines in the movie as Philmore Walker) to apprehend a nefarious terrorist Arab (played ironically by Gene Simmons). He does so with tactics that would make Jack Bauer whimper in the corner, while at the same time dealing with slimy bureaucratic red-tape. This is a great mindless action flick and holds up well amongst repeat viewings. But the mere fact that the Writer/Director of this great little film went on to write and direct the utterly horrid "Poltergeist III" right afterwards boggles the mind.My Grade: B+</p>
