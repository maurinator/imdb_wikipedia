<h1>Uprising (2001)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Using radically refashioned archival footage of the Warsaw ghetto, this interview with Jon Avnet the director of Uprising talks about Marek Edelman who is an evocative memoir of his role in the rebellion that held back the Nazis for almost a month in 1943. The film begins with the growing list of prohibitions and regulations leading to the virtual imprisonment of about half-a-million Polish Jews in an old slum district of Warsaw with inadequate space and plumbing. An overhead tracking shot shows the number of people assembled in the first months of the relocation. The daily struggle against hunger and disease, especially among the dispossessed arrivals seen in their pitful rags, is aggravated by the German demands for "deportations to the east" that many begin to suspect are camouflaged mass murders. By the close of 1942, people living in the ghetto realize they are doomed, and the rudiments of resistance are planned by a handful of the young, including Edelman. Following some sporadic, spontaneous fighting at the ghetto railhead, the Umschlagplatz, in January, led by Moredecai Anielewicz, the scene is set for the more famous and prolonged battle that will begin on 19 April 1943. In the intervening time, many of the ghetto residents construct hidden shelters or bunkers in the basements and cellars of the buildings, often with tunnels leading to other buildings. The handful of fighters who have weapons take to these shelters, giving the uprising the advantage of defensive positions.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you have to choose between this movie and the Pianist, please choose the later. By far the greater movie of the two. Although Uprising might not be a totally bad movie (if it was made about a fictional event) It seems to totally miss the point. The helplessness the desperation, the sheer agony of the whole event is turned into some action flick riddled with cheap accusations, while the ordinary Jews are portrayed as a heroic group of commandos that don't miss a shot and can take on the well trained Nazi forces. Sobieski's acting definitely deserves notice, but she should be ashamed! Herself being half Polish she's taking part in falsification of history that not only discredits her people but also creates a false account of what the remaining Jews tried to do... That is die with dignity and honor, revenge the atrocities, with little to no hope of escaping alive. Any serious resistance lasted a few days, with a few random shots being fired for another couple weeks after. The fighters that have managed to escape the total destruction of the ghetto, joined the well planned massive Warsaw Uprising few months later... Which although much bigger and successful at first suffered a similar faith. Being cut off from the outside with Soviet forces standing on the east side of the river and the western allies who's policies it represented restraining themselves to only some air supply drops (only one British soldier fought in the uprising, with thousands of Polish soldiers defending Great Britain and their Capital) the movie makes no mention of the later uprising, one of the biggest in history that was planned for months to overthrow the German occupation. The heroic action scenes would find their place there. But instead of making a movie with the ideology of Masada, you're given this... monstrosity. If you decide to watch this movie try to keep in mind that both uprisings are combined for you into one happy Hollywood package. Both uprisings that seem so similar at a far glance, but with completely different reasoning behind them.</p>
