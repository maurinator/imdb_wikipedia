<h1>White Mile (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>How far would you go to keep your job? That's the question the ad for this movies states. Based on a true story, Dan Cutler is the head of a New York advertising agency. In a move to build character, he books a trip for a whitewater rafting trip on Canada's White Mile. After the raft turns over, all of the men scatter all over the rapids. Some of them are found dead, which leads to a lawsuit by one of the wives of the deceased.</p>
<p>The longing to win a race convertes a simple wildwater rafting competition into war.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Alan Alda realistically portrays an all too common tyrannical boss in this true to life adventure. Companies are self serving, and that combined with a self serving executive proves fatal for five men. Anyone who has worked under such conditions will immediately recognize the plight of only doing something, you obviously feel uncomfortable with, to please a boss. The ill-fated rafting trip exposes Alan Alda's character as manipulative, uncaring, and devoid of conscience. The white water expedition is really well done, and the viewer gets a good idea of just how quickly things can go terribly wrong. Highly recommended. - MERK</p>
