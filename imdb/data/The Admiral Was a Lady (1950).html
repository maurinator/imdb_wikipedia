<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Admiral Was A Lady casts Wanda Hendrix as a recently discharged WAVE who by a curious chain of circumstances gets herself mixed up with four veterans all from a discharged bomber crew. If it were not for the fact that these four who are played by Edmond O'Brien, Richard Erdman, Steve Brodie, and Johnny Sands were combat veterans from the recent war, they'd be seen as deadbeats. In fact they're flirting with the status right now.O'Brien and his pals have made a positive genius of not working and stretching their unemployment benefits to the maximum. They get caught at it, but by private detectives who are working for millionaire Rudy Vallee. Wanda's fianc√© is involved with Vallee's ex-wife Hillary Brooke and Vallee wants Hillary back. Best way to do it is get Wanda and the never seen 'Henry' together.The way Wanda talks about Henry he's quite the paragon of virtue. One thing is for sure though, he's not as much fun as the deadbeat quartet as exasperating as they can be. The only question is which one she will marry.The title refers to the fact that the men start referring to Hendrix as 'the Admiral'. The Admiral Was A Lady is a film that deserves to be better known and might have been if it wasn't an independent released from United Artists, but came from a major studio instead.</p>
