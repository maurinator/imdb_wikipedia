<h1>Son of the Pink Panther (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Eighth entry in the Pink Panther. It is nearly 30 years since Inspector Jacques Clouseau managed to get Maria Gambrelli off from a murder charge (events of "A Shot In The Dark".) Maria has gone on and have moved to a seaside town. Also Princess Yasmin of Lugash has come to the town for a holiday with her father. She is kidnapped and because of the strong ties between France and Lugash, Chief Inspector Dreyfus is called in to find her. He is hampered by the local police officer Jacques and is amazed when he finds that Jacques is Maria's son. He is terrified even though he and Maria are falling in love that Jacques is Clouseau's son and Jacques is showing Clouseau-ish behaviour. Both Jacques and Dreyfus set out to find the missing Princess...</p>
<p>A princess who is in France to accompany her father on a diplomatic mission. She is kidnapped by people who wants her father to abdicate, which he will not do even for her. And since her country has such close ties to France the president instructs police commissioner Dreyfuss to go where the princess was kidnapped and oversee the investigation. On the way he runs into the kidnappers and were to be shot when a patrolman stumbles into them and saves Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss thinks that there is something familiar about this policeman. When he goes to the local police chief and tells him that he will be handling the investigation and asks for his best man, he gives him Gambrelli, who just happens to be the policeman he met earlier as a means of retaliation. And having another encounter with Gambrelli, he goes to his home to meet his mother, and is shocked to discover that his father's Clouseau, which is whom Gambrelli reminds Dreyfuss of. After Dreyfuss is injured, he gives the task of finding the princess to Gambrelli, cause he is the only one who knows who the kidnappers are. And just like his father, he bumbles through it.</p>
<p>Charles Dreyfus encounters Jacques Gambrelli, who reminds him painfully of Inspector Clouseau, the man who drove him insane. With good reason: Gambrelli is Clouseau's son.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The "Pink Panther" franchise has spawned a number of movies.  The last one in the series is "Son of the Pink Panther."  It stars Roberto Benigni as the original Inspector Jacques Clouseau's son.  He does a good job stumbling and bumbling his way through the story.  It's easy to picture Benigni as a Clouseau-type stumblebum.  And a number of characters appear that, although they did not appear in "The Pink Panther," have become familiar in other "Panther" movies.  But the last in the line differs somewhat from the original.  Its tone isn't quite as lighthearted as the first.  It has a lot of violence that seems to taint the movie.  Although there are a few good scenes, this movie reminds us all how sorely Peter Sellers is missed.</p>
