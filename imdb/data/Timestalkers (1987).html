<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a TV movie, with a rather limited budget. It is not meant to be a thriller or a marvel of science fiction. Nothing in it is original, and as most other time travel films, it asks you not to think too much about the logic of time travel. It's basically a nice little family film that you can watch with your kids on a lazy afternoon and have some fun. There are no scenes in it that contain real violence or that come off as particularly threatening. Our heroes breeze through the obstacles the plot throws at them with considerable ease. Granted, the absence of real tension and the fact that the antagonist is not truly menacing is a problem, but I am willing to disregard that problem because I find the overall experience of watching this quite pleasant. The cast is pretty good and it's a pleasure to watch them on screen. The female lead steals the show, though. There's lots of nostalgia here for those who remember the 80s.</p>
