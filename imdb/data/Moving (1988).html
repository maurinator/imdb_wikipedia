<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Moving is a lightweight R-rated comedy featuring Richard Pryor as Arlo Pear. He's an engineer who loses his job in a merger but finds a new job that requires him to move from New Jersey to Boise, Idaho.However, his family isn't happy about the move, especially his daughter Casey (Stacey Dash) because she wants to graduate first before leaving.They do move and it seems Murphy's Law hits Arlo over and over again. From hiring a deranged man to drive his Saab to Boise, to criminal moving men, to buying a house in Boise from a crazy old man, it seems Arlo's mental state is being tested to see if it will break.Moving seemingly would work great as a family film as it has that Cosby Show feel to it but for some strange reason they chose to make it an R- rated film and stunt its box office potential.Regardless, Pryor is in good form here and seeing him react to his worsening luck over and over again is fun stuff. Randy Quaid also shines as his neighbor and deranged ex-Vietnam vet Frank Crawford, who childishly abuses Arlo. There are some cool small roles from the likes of Rodney Dangerfield and pro wrestler King Kong Bundy, as well.Not the best Richard Pryor comedy out there but a good one and a lot better than the critics at the time opined. I just wonder how much better it would have been, critically and financially, if it were a PG film.</p>
