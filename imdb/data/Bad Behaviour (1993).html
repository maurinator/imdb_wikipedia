<h1>Bad Behaviour (1993)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The McAllister family house is the setting for Gerry and Ellie's grapples with work, children and how to get the bathroom fixed. Both have reached the stage where reason cannot be heard above the ticking clock of experience and ambition. When temptation comes, how will they react?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>OK, so the plot might be minimal in this one, but the cast are good enough to make you overlook that.  The cast includes Stephen Rea as the harrassed ad man who dreams of being a cartoon superhero for his kids, Sinead Cusack as his wife, Claire Higgins as a neurotic friend, Philip Jackson as a businessman con artist, and Phil Daniels as an inept pair of twin builders.I thought that Stephen Rea in particular was great in this; he usually gets all the intense parts to play and this was a bit more lightweight comedy.  One or two bits of the film didn't ring true but in the main it is entertaining.</p>
