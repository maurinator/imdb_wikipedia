<p>Marina (Eliana Lage) is a beautiful and perfect young woman, daughter of leprous parents, living in an institution. She sees the chance to leave the place when the owner of a small shipyard in an island proposes to marry her. She accepts, marries him without love and moves to the small sea coastal village, where the gossiper dwellers make comments about her. The disgusting partner of her scum husband tries to rape Marina when her husband is traveling. Later, her husband dies in a boat accident, and a young and handsome sailor arrives in the island. Marina feels a great attraction for him, but is blackmailed by the former partner of her husband about the health problems in her family and her origins."Caiçara" is a melodramatic and romantic story that begins very similar to "Stromboli", of the same year. The situation of a young beautiful woman that uses marriage to have a chance of a new life and moves to an island is identical in both movies. But then the plots are completely different, and the IMDb Plot Outline in completely inaccurate. The copy available in MAM (Modern Art Museum of Rio de Janeiro) presented serious problem in the sound, and many dialogs were impossible to be understood in the projection. Anyway, "Caiçara" is a good movie not available on VHS or DVD. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Caiçara" (means a simple and humble dweller on the seacoast of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo states)</p>
