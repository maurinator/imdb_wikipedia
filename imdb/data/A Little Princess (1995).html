<p>A young girl is relegated to servitude at a boarding school when her father goes missing and is presumed dead.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film transcends the "Children's Films" genre, to become a lovely miniature masterpiece.  This director is fabulous! He is a master of mood and ambiance and a real artist with his compositions!  (Just go see his Great Expectations modern remake for further proof!)   The cast excels with the familiar material, Eleanor Bron is letter perfect as the wicked headmistress of the school, never descending into caricature, but still making her mark as a the villianous Miss Minchin.  Liesel Matthews is a surprising delight as the title character, the other little girls are stereotypical but miraculously wonderful in their individual parts! Rarely does a film completely draw you into it's world and grab hold of your emotions like this one.  The imagery and design elements are remarkable.  The passages from India are mystical and powerful, the use of green throughout the design elements is inspired and helps create this world of wonder seen through a child's eyes.  Even though, we can guess the ending, it still manages to wring you dry of tears before the final lovely "silent movie" fade-out. A pure delight from beginning to end!  (this must be seen on DVD to fully appreciate the design elements)</p>
