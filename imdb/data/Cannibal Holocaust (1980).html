<h1>Cannibal Holocaust (1980)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A New York anthropologist named Professor Harold Monroe travels to the wild, inhospitable jungles of South America to find out what happened to a documentary film crew that disappeared two months before while filming a documentary about primitive cannibal tribes deep in the rain forest. With the help of two local guides, Professor Monroe encounters two tribes, the Yacumo and the Yanomamo. While under the hospitality of the latter tribe, he finds the remains of the crew and several reels of their undeveloped film. Upon returning to New York City, Professor Monroe views the film in detail, featuring the director Alan Yates, his girlfriend Faye Daniels, and cameramen Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. After a few days of traveling, the film details how the crew staged all the footage for their documentary by terrorizing and torturing the natives. Despite Monroe's objections, the television studio Pan American still wishes to air the footage as a legitimate documentary. In order to change their minds, Monroe shows the station's executives the film's final reels, so they could see first hand how the crew's fate came to be.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this film we meet a documentary team of three young men and a young woman. They are heading for the south-American jungle to search for real cannibals. After a while the crew is reported missing and a rescue team is send from the US. This team gets in touch with an amazon tribe called the Tree-people. The tree-people gives them the only remains of the first crew - the film rolls containing the material this crew shot during their search for real cannibals. Back in the US we get to see these films. We now get to see exactly what happened to the first crew.</p>
<p>The director Alan Yates and his crew, formed by Faye Daniels, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso, head to a rain forest in Amazonas called Green Inferno to shoot a documentary about the primitive tribes of cannibals that live in the area. They vanish and the American anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe travels to the area with the experienced guide Chaco Losojos and his assistant Miguel to seek the team out. The trio is received first by the Yacumo tribe of warriors and then they approach to the wild Yamamomo that is in a permanent war against the Shamatari. They find the remains of the documentary team and their reels, and they successfully negotiate with the savages. Back in New York, Professor Monroe watches the disturbing footage and discovers the fate of the team.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Finally available in a slightly edited form in the UK, Ruggero Deodato's infamous 'video nasty' stands apart from almost every other banned title by virtue of the fact that it looks stunning, is well-directed, unflinchingly acted and stops at nothing to get its message across. Not since the notoriously disturbing documentary THE ANIMALS FILM (1981) or Mick Jackson's harrowing THREADS (1984) has a movie so comprehensively knocked the stuffing out of me with its grim-faced persistence, huge swathes of seething anger and sheer kinetic energy.I sat down to watch Cannibal Holocaust one evening and was captivated from the outset, as Deodato's camera glides across the Amazon to Riz Ortolani's enormously haunting score. When the film ended, it seemed as if only half an hour or so had passed, because all my attention had been with the events unfolding on the screen. Deodato does not allow room for the viewer to breathe, let alone become distracted, as he pummels us with moments of shattering brutality, amazing tranquility, adrenalin-soaked fear and escalating madness. Whilst the point Deodato has to make is simple - that our 'civilized society' is every bit as rapacious and disgusting as the primitive society of the jungle tribes - the way he chooses to make it is anything but, effortlessly juggling the real and the imagined (the line between the two becomes even more blurred with the introduction of the infamous 'Last Road To Hell' sequence), turning the audience against the supposed good guys and forcing us by fair means or foul to re-evaluate where we stand in relation to the issues raised with every frame that passes. Cannibal Holocaust is NOT a film to be taken lightly, or watched with friends as a Friday night beer-and-burgers movie. It deserves your undivided attention and utmost seriousness, because only then will its raw power and unremitting intensity hit you as hard as the director intended.</p>
