<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Danny, an ambitious singing/dancing cat, goes to Hollywood and overcomes several obstacles to fulfill his dream of becoming a movie star.</p>
<p>Danny is a cat leaving his small-town home for the big time in Hollywood. He comes in hoping to sing and dance his way into stardom, not knowing that animals can only be extras. And if he forgets his place, child starlet Darla Dimple and her musclehead butler Max have ways of reminding him!</p>
<p>A young ambitious cat named Danny comes to Hollywood with a song in his heart, dancing moves in his feet and the dream of becoming a movie star. When he gets there, he learns that he can get no part other than the stereotypical cat roles with "meow" being his sole line. With his friends, including a discouraged female dancer turned secretary named Sawyer, he sets out to change that situation. However, Darla Dimple, the child star, is also out to ensure that the gang will never get that chance and become a threat to her career.</p>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I'll always be a hardcore Disney fan, but I can't help but have a real soft spot for movies which prove that dreams can come true. This movie about anthropomorphic characters (animals that are like people) is simply incredible- animation stylized, cute, and fun... with an incredible plot, great music (I bought the soundtrack), amazing voice talent (that includes singing!), and believable characters.  This is a real keeper...and I'm surprised that it didn't get as much attention as it deserved.  I'd reccomend it to anyone who's had a dream, or who has one... and those who just love cartoons.</p>
