<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>and worth seeing more than twice. This film has a haunting quality that stays with you.Shelley Winters as a nagging wife- Peter Finch as the beleaguered husband. He is tired and bored. Much of the film is located on Isle of Wight, and the scenes are rainy and moody. His marriage is falling apart, his job bores him.Finch (Harry ) meets a young woman hitch hiking and decides to help her out. There are many commentaries on the transiency of his life, his job; life in general. Overall this film conveys a sense of alienation and disturbance. It almost seems like psychological horror, in retrospect. Do not miss it. 9/10.</p>
