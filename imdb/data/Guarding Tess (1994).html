<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When this movie was bought, I at first wasn't keen on watching it except because of Nicolas Cage I thought it might be alright.Well when I sat down to watch this movie I was quite surprised to how entertaining this movie actually was.There were funny parts that would put a smile on my face and some that made me laugh out loud. There were also great drammatical parts later in the film that just added to the fine touches of making a great film.The chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine worked so well and their performances entertaining and often funny.A great movie about learning to appreciate what is given to you and not wasting energy on what you cannot get. A gem of a movie, I recommend it.</p>
