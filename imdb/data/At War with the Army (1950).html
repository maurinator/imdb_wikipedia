<h1>At War with the Army (1950)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Alvin Corwin is low man on the totem pole, and goes from one mishap to another at an army training camp in World War II.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After stealing the shows with their supporting roles in "My Friend Irma" and its sequel "My Friend Irma Goes West" Paramount decided to build an entire film around their popular contract player comedy duo, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. This 1950 release was a huge hit that would inspire numerous other successful teamings before they split up in 1956. Placing the two of them on an army base and getting them involved in all sorts of crazy situations on and off the front lines adds up to some sheer hilarity and one of their best teamings.</p>
