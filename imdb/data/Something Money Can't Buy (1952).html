<h1>Something Money Can't Buy (1952)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A British Army Officer returns to civilian life after WWII. He finds that his wife is running a successful employment agency so he must become a "house husband". He doesn't find this at all easy, so he gets together with some of his ex-army pals and they try to start a catering company.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>It's hard to care about the problems faced  by this genteel upper middle class family.  Drippy hubby (Anthony Steel) searches for a job immediately post WW2, while Patricia Roc (who acts well) minds the baby. However, Nino Rota's beautifully soppy music almost makes up for the uneventful plot and dull marital conflicts.</p>
