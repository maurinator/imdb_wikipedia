<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>A fishing association organizes every year a banquet where the trout fished throughout the Association will be tasted. Out of it, a group of people not invited to the event has decided to make an appearance and the staff responsible for cooking and serving the banquet refuse to do so by an unresolved labor agreement.The trout is a film directed by José Luis García Sánchez. He won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1979. It premiered in Spain on 1 April 1978. It is the third feature by the director. One of its peculiarities is its ensemble cast, which some critics have compared to the works of Luis Garcia Berlanga or "El Ángel Exterminador" by Luis Buñuel In his two previous films "El Lobo Feroz" (1975) and "Colorín Colorado" (1976) Jose Luis Garcia Sanchez scored an uncomfortable and bitter way for a person who wants to pursue art (in all facets) in our country: a mood bitter bombproof lose based on respect for the conventions.Each of the films Salmantino Director (from the best to the failed) leaves the viewer and invites a bitter aftertaste from laughter, to question around us and ourselves. The game of "Valle Inclan" of the magical mirrors "Callejón Del Gato" is present in all the work of García Sánchez has no qualms about questioning everything in our country is considered sacred emphasis on the most important issues but, at the same time not forgetting to make us laugh Amid the turbulent political situation José Luis García Sánchez premiered "Las Truchas", a film about the banquet and awards ceremony of a society of fishermen and the consequences of it. The story comes from a family story of self García Sánchez who attended a similar banquet in which the president of the host association did not hesitate to indulge every one of the prizes of the evening and served, later, to build this comic operetta, this gritty tale about the political process that existed at that time.Las Truchas is one of those hard films for the general public and, possibly, was a thorny issue as satire. Perhaps it was for this reason that García Sánchez did not return to direct a film until 1985 where he brought to the screen a script with Rafael Azcona entitled "La Corte Del Rey Pharaoh," one of the best comedies of the 80s.Perhaps this is one of the forgotten films of Spanish cinema and that is not on a list of viewings required for any film student or film buffs. Above the technical weaknesses of the time Garcia Sanchez signed one of those films that you are stuck, you get get you a smile in the worst possible situation</p>
