<h1>Gaby (1956)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gaby is a ballet dancer in 1944 London who happens to bump into a corporal Greg while rushing to catch the bus. Greg is mesmerized by Gaby and goes to the ballet to see her on stage, but Gaby is French and wants nothing to do with Greg. But he persists and by the end of the day, she agrees to marry. But before they can marry, there is a mountain of red tape and Greg ships out while promising to marry Gaby on his return. When she hears that he has been killed, she makes herself available to anyone who would want her.</p>
<p>This is a remake of the 1931 and 1940 versions of the movie Waterloo Bridge.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>By the 1950s, remakes were very much the thing - 'Gaby', with Leslie Caron as the ballerina and John Kerr as the soldier, is the third film version of 'Waterloo Bridge' (first done with Mae Clarke and Kent Douglass in 1931, then with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor in 1940). It's by far the most dull, even though it does make clear what Gaby has been up to while her beau was away at war.Leslie Caron being the star, of course Gaby is now French, not English. John Kerr is a GI who finds himself at a loose end on leave in London. There's air raids to content with, foggy streets, and taxis, as well as Gaby's fellow dancer and roommate, and the GI's English well-heeled relations.Sweet enough, but paling in comparison beside the other versions, both of whom have more merit. It's OK - but nothing special.</p>
