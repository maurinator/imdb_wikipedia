<h1>Number One (1969)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>The story of Cat Catlan (Heston), a washed up quarterback who turns to drink and women to solve his problems. But he soon discovers that his problems are just beginning.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Chuck Heston is not a football star, but an actor playing one. I laugh at the comments made by the other comments here; expecting Chuck to play like a pro. That's why they call it acting.Truthfully, football is only a backdrop for a story about a faded legend trying to hold on to his career by the skin of his teeth. It's an interesting tale of all of us; facing the reality of old age.Being that this was filmed in the late 1960s, it has a real 60s flair to it, which to me makes it kind of neat. I liked the "surprise" ending.Number One is not the greatest movie ever made, but it is a decent entertaining flick.</p>
