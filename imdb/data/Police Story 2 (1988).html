<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>than the original, in my opinion.  It's got a little less plot, but it's a much grittier, harsher film.  The villains are beyond contempt, the part where they read Maggie Cheung's letter is really sad and I hate 'em for it! Of course this is remedied with the usual helping of Jackie kicking all their butts in the fantastic final battle!  I like this one a heck of a lot, but it's tough to see Maggie get hurt in the outtakes...OUCH!!!</p>
