<h1>Diggstown (1992)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Gabriel Caine has just been released from prison when he sets up a bet with a business man. The business man owns most of a boxing-mad town called Diggstown. The bet is that Gabe can find a boxer that will knock out 10 Diggstown men, in a boxing ring, within 24 hours. "Honey" Roy Palmer is that man - although at 48, many say he is too old. A sub plot is thrown in about Charles Macum Diggs - the heavyweight champion that gave the town its name - and who is now confined to a wheel-chair.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I find Diggstown to be one of the best movies of all time. My only regret is that I don't have amnesia so that I can go back and experience the ending for the first time again.I love the background music. Storyline and plot are wonderful. I can watch this movie over and over again. There are at least 50 great quotes that I use on a daily basis. Acting is good throughout. Some of the best acting is by the extras in the background of the bar scenes.James Wood is terrific, maybe his best role ever. Lou Jr. is very believable as an aging fighter. Bruce Dern plays a scumbag to a tee. Tex Cobb's best role also. Platt is terrific (as he always is). Only disappointments were Heather Graham - She gave a lackluster performance, and Hammerhead - he was way too young, should have been more aged.</p>
