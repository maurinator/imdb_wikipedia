<h1>ABBA: The Movie (1977)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Movie detailing ABBA's mega-successful tour of Australia during mid-1977. While it mostly contains back-stage footage and as well as ABBA's famous songs such as "Dancing Queen", "Tiger", "Name Of The Game" and "Eagle" among others sung filmed during their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide, it has the sub-plot of young country and western radio disc-jockey, Ashley, whose boss orders him to have a deep interview with ABBA and the problems he has trying to reach them as he forgets his press pass and ABBA's main bodyguard, (Tom Oliver) is determined to stop him...</p>
<p>This movie about the other "Fab Four" (of Sweden), is virtually devoid of any plot, except that the "hero" is seeking to get an interview with Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny and Frida (a.k.a "ABBA") during their famous Australian tour.</p>
<p>An incompetent radio DJ tries to get an interview with the Swedish pop group during their famous week-long 1977 tour of Australia.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this movie on Oprah Winfrey's Oxygen Network (thanks Oprah!). I had heard of it. I'm an ABBA fan. I love their music. I think Agnetha and Frida are two of the best singers I've ever heard. They're also very beautiful. Watching this movie is like being in a time machine. It brings back all of the memories of that time, you know, when music was still worth listening to. I wish someone would put this movie on DVD. The disc jockey stuff isn't bad. As a matter of fact it's kind of cool. He has a dream sequence that's interesting with Agnetha and Frida. Well anyway, I never got to see ABBA in concert so I'll really enjoyed this movie! I give it the highest rating possible. But then again, I'm a music nut!</p>
