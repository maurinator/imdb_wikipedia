<h1>The Sum of Us (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Set in Sydney, Australia. A (heterosexual) father and his gay son are trying to find Ms/Mr Right respectively. The film shows their relationships with one another and the objects of their affection as tradgedy strikes. There is no overt 'message' in the film, just a very natural, entertaining story-telling.</p>
<p>"The Sum of Us" is an Aussie story about a father and a son both searching for love and sharing an unconventional bond. Harry, the father, is the caring and open-minded "mate" that borders on annoyance. His son Jeff unsucessfully searches for love, with the un-wanted guidance of his father.</p>
<p>A widowed father has to deal with two complex issues: while he is searching for "Miss Right," his son, who is in his 20s and gay, is searching for "Mr. Right."</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is very well-done, and you immediately care about the main characters.  Father and son stories are usually a drag ("Nothing in Common"), but not this one.  A couple of scenes will break your heart; I cried like a baby at one point. It is especially worthwhile if you are gay, and discovered that about yourself as a child.</p>
