<h1>After Hours (1985)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A meek word processor impulsively travels to Manhattan's Soho District to date an attractive but apparently disturbed young woman and finds himself trapped there in a nightmarishly surreal vortex of improbable coincidences and farcical circumstances.</p>
<p>Paul meets Marcy at a coffee shop after work, and gets her phone number. He calls her, she asks him to come over, and things take a turn for the bizarre. Paul spends the rest of the night trying to get home, dealing with angry cabbies, dead women (and their bartender husbands), clumsy catburglars, quirky sculptresses, unstable waitresses, condescending bouncers, and irate mobs led by ice cream truck drivers along the way.</p>
<p>A New York office worker has "a very strange night" when he ventures for a late night date with a woman he just meets, which turns into waking nightmare when one mishap after another strands him in a hostile neighborhood in his quest to return home before morning.</p>
<p>Paul Hacketts embarks on a trip to SoHo in hopes of scoring with a pretty women he just met, but when his money flies out the window he is stuck in SoHo. The movie details his experiences that night with a wide array of criminals, kooks, psychotics, sadomasochists, punks, and an angry mob trying to kill him. Strangely, the seemingly disconnected events are interwoven in unusual and unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Conjure up an urban world where apparently friendly young ladies all turn out to be somewhere between odd and crazy. Then imagine you're up here to see one such girl and your last bill has flown out of the cab window on the way. Then pretend your date has committed suicide, you've somehow got branded as a serial robber, and another girl is after you with her ice cream van. You could well be Paul Hackett stranded in New York's SoHo in the early hours miles away from your uptown word processing job. You've got some change but since the subway fares went up at midnight, not enough to get back. Who do you call? Definitely not the police.</p>
<p>An ordinary word processor has the worst night of his life after he agrees to visit a girl in Soho whom he met that evening at a coffee shop.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Such a dark, ironic and uncomfortably funny string of events plus a large helping of bizarre, paranoid and unpredictable characters have never before been forged into one story.The film follows Paul Hacket (Griffin Dunne) on a date from hell, where from square one it all goes horribly wrong.  As we move on, the mood winds up into a frenzied nightmare as this poor mans' plight goes from bad to worse. "All I want to do is go home" he says, running for his life from an angry mob.The story isn't complex, which you may think could bore, but the characters are so delightfully wacky that you can't help but be transfixed.We've all had bad days when we've said "Phew!  What a nightmare!" - well forget it, until you've taken half the knocks this guy does, you've had but a walk in the park.Don't just rent this movie - buy it.</p>
