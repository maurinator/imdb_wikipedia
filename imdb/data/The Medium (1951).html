<h1>The Medium (1951)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Madame Flora is terrified when she perceives a supernatural presence during one of her fraudulent s√©ances. Menotti's first international success, "The Medium" is a tragedy in two acts for five singers, a dance-mime role, and a chamber opera for thirteen instruments and fourteen players: flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, percussion, piano (4 hands), and string quintet. The music is dissonant, eerie, and morbid and includes melodies such as 'O, black swan.'</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Menotti's opera came to the screen in this black and white production that earned an Oscar nom for Score but equally deserved recognition for its cinematography and art direction - top notch and unforgettable. Do seek it out if you are a fan of unusual films and of contemporary opera.  It's quite impressive.</p>
