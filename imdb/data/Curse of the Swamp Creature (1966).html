<h1>Curse of the Swamp Creature (1966)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Deep in the rural swamps of Texas the mad Dr. Simond Trent is conducting experiments on the local swamp people in an attempt to discover the secret of evolution. When a party of oil surveyors comes upon his isolated laboratory he decides to take the final step and turn one of them into a grotesque amphibious creature.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This atrociously shot monster movie is a third-rate remake of VOODOO WOMAN, itself a second-rate quickie that wasn't exactly begging for a resurrection. A scientist residing in the deep swamp uses people's bodies for his quack de-evolution experiments. When a group of small-time criminals arrive in this remote little neck of the swamp, they quickly find themselves in a quite a bind with the crazed Doctor, as well as with the regional voodoo-drumming swamp-dwellers.Our 'de rigeur' mad doctor's dabbling yields a preposterous looking monster(imagine a hard-luck distant cousin of THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) which is only active, and barely so, during the last five minutes of this plodding, flavorless insult to cinema.Not recommended, even to the most rabid fans of bad movies. 2.5/10</p>
