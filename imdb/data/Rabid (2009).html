<h1>Rabid (2009)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Zod and his soldiers release a virus in the air that transforms the humans into zombies. While finding a way for reversing the effect, Dr Hamilton finds out he needs blood from another Kryptonian to counteract the virus. So Chloe asks Clark to donate a bit of his blood even when that risks Clark from being discovered by Zod.</p>
<p>After Tess is admitted to the hospital showing plague-like symptoms, Clark has Dr. Hamilton investigate the cause with a Disease Control specialist. Clark overhears that Tess was at the Daily Planet when she began to show symptoms, so he speeds to the Planet to rescue Lois in the mist of a zombie-attack against the city. In a battle with multiple zombie attackers, Lois is bitten. Clark then volunteers his blood to Dr. Hamilton, who discovers that the virus was created from Kryptonian enzymes, so the doctor needs a cure. It is revealed that the virus was used as a ploy to draw out 'the Blur', as one of Major Zod's men realize that he is also Kryptonian. Based on the House of El symbol the Blur brands around town, Zod believes that Jor-El is on Earth, and has harnessed the power from Earth's yellow Sun for himself which increases the frustration with Zod as to why the Kryptonian has super powers while he and the rest of his followers don't. Yet still, neither Clark nor Zod are aware of each others existence. Meanwhile, Oliver decides to burn his Green Arrow outfit, and give up trying to be a superhero due to his guilt over recent events.</p>
<p>Clark, unknowingly, exposes himself to Zod when a virus is released on Metropolis that turns its residents into zombies.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>An homage to George A. Romero's work ? It could have been if Jordan Hawley, the writer, thought of Zombies films as society metaphors instead of stupid horror fictions. The production quality didn't help as at times it look liked a bad B movie. The creatures make-up and dynamic filming were acceptable but the lighting was really bad. Dark rooms illuminated by random green and bright white lights with no rational explanation. Of course the idea was to make some scenes scary but I think the director miserably failed to render the appropriate ambiance. Even the reference to 28 Days Later right at the beginning was disappointing because they chose to copy and paste a scene instead of simply using it as an inspiration. The plane caught in a storm visual effects were also really poor. But from time to time I have to admit that it was decent entertainment. First there were some nice Clois moments and beside the action characters were developed. A scene with Lois was specially interesting as she told someone how she felt about the Blur. However I think this time it's Oliver who deserves our attention because his scenes with Clark were fascinating. In fact I think what he said about the Blur had never been covered before and his words should appeal to viewers fond of religion and symbols. The dark path is on also reminds me of Jimmy in season 8 and the issues he had to deal with. I can't wait for him to get better because I think other characters have a lot to learn from him. But again I question the morality behind the show because when one character has a problem it seems others just give up on it instead of helping it. Is it to bring more drama ? Probably but I wish the relationships were less superficial, specially considering their history and deep connections. But as first mentioned I think the biggest issue was the story itself. When Metallo injected some emotions to the Zod arc, Rabid mostly brought confusion and irrational elements. But somehow even if the cure to the disease wasn't original it was at least an excuse for an other great Clois scene.</p>
