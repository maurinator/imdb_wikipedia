Some come forward to help, others are less willing.</p>
<p>A dramatization of the British Expeditionary Force's 1940 retreat to the beaches of France and the extraordinary seaborne evacuation that saved it from utter destruction by Nazi Germany.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>See it Â– A surprisingly great war film, this movie tells two different stories. One is about a group of British soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, desperately trying to make their way to the French coast. Meanwhile, on the other side of the channel, English civilians bravely prepare to help with the mass evacuation at Dunkirk. Near the end, the two stories converge "Tarantino style." There aren't many household names in this one. Richard Attenborough headlines a cast of British actors that have recognizable faces but are relatively unknown to Americans. There is quite a bit of combat in the middle stage of the film as the British soldiers dart from hedge to farmhouse to avoid capture by the Jerries. The pace of the movie slows toward the end, but this is a historically accurate and memorable retelling of real heroes who snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. 3 out of 5 action rating.</p>
