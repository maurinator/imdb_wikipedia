Not exactly benevolent, Mota enlists the aid of Bryant (a former Nazi) in a scheme to bring Earth under control of a supreme dictator, for its own good of course, using advanced atomic weapons. But their attempts to steal uranium alert Kent Fowler of Fowler Air Patrol, who sets out singlehanded to foil the villains. Fist-fights and wrecks in every episode.</p>
<p>A single-handed hero sets himself against Martians trying to assume control of Earth.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>If you enjoy old republic serials with their cookie cutter villains and Wholesome as oatmeal heroes this is another one of those flicks.  Nothing bad but nothing terribly special.  It does feel like your watching a piece of the past though.</p>
