<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>After reading so many bad comments on this film, I guess I'm one of the few that disagree with the critics.  I really liked this movie.  I thought it was well directed by William Fraker, with terrific photography and a well written story.  So, for once, there isn't a lot of blood and guts all over the place.  Who cares?  It was also interesting to me to see how the Lone Ranger got his name and the whole silver bullet legend, which I never knew.  So, thanks for filling me in on that subject.  Some wonderful performances by all of the leads.  How wonderful to see Jason Robards as President Grant.  He added so much to the role with his usuall unbeatable acting abilities.  This is a terrific actor in all that he does.  And Christopher Lloyd as "Butch" Cavendish, the villain, plays the part with simplicity and not the usuall western bad guy.  It was nice to see Lloyd play a different kind of role other than the character from "Taxi" he's known for.  I liked Matt Clark as the Sheriff.  You see Clark in many films and most of the time his work goes un-noticed.  This actor, too, does fine character work.  Then we have the Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Yes, there are many legends that lean on the gay relationship, but this viewer liked these two actors.  I didn't know that Klinton Spilsbury's voice was dubbed as the Ranger.  But I thought he had lots of charm and certainly good looks, with or without the mask.  His scenes with the horse, Silver, were wonderfully humorous and appealing.  His scene in the church with Amy was also well played and well photographed.  I liked this actor and don't understand why he never appeared again in a film.  It must have been his own choice.As Tonto, Michael Horse was perfection.  Simply played with dignity for his race, he brought some nice quality to the film.  You felt that unsaid respect and devotion the two heroes had for one another.  If you want to go the gay route, do so.  I guess in this day and age, one must take that aspect and build on it.  What, then, does that say of the Three Muskateers?</p>
