<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Good chemistry between the characters - whether it's friends, parents, ex's, or lovers.  The timing was right on, and everyone delivered.Great casting from the Radio Psychologist (Rob Reiner) down to the last little kid.Randy Quaid is one actor that usually needs tempering in his roles.....but not this one.  He managed to be outrageous, testosterone laden, and rough-cut without sacrificing the depth of his character.This was also the first movie in which I'd seen Janeane Garofalo (aka "The Date"), and I immediately added her to my list of favorites.  I've since rented several other of her films, all of which I've enjoyed - especially "The Truth About Cats & Dogs".Also keep an eye out for Mae Whitman ("Michele") - She needs a little more seasoning, but someday this kid is going to have "Oscar-winner" in front of her name.A thoroughly enjoyable film.</p>
