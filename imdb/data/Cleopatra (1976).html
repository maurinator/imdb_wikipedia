<h1>Cleopatra (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Julius Caesar's arrival in Egypt proves more than interesting to the beautiful Cleopatra, ambitious sister to the boy pharaoh.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is not (as indicated by another reviewer) a BBC production, but a 'Hallmark Hall of Fame' American production (though there are no Americans in the cast). I'm not familiar with the original play, but it's obvious, considering Shaw's tendencies to be verbose and long-winded, it has been seriously edited. The performances of the 2 leads are excellent as usual. I have always found Bujold eminently watchable, though Shaw was something of a misogynist when writing female roles, and Guiness is Guiness. Unfortunately the rest of the cast is not up to their standards. The play itself has little to do with historical fact (Cleo did in fact sire a child by Caesar). If you wish to see this, it available on youtube.</p>
