<h1>James Bond (1987)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An hour documentary on the history of Bond for the 25th anniversary of the film series.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Taken for what it was - a look back at some of Bond's greatest moments, this show really succeeds. Made for broadcast television, this was approached as a typical "sitcom-type" retrospective episode. It seems to be meant for for a casual James Bond observer or the completely ignorant, like I was at the time (and 13 too). This worked wonderfully as an advertisement of the franchise as a whole. It introduces the character of Bond, and many of the women, gadgets and villains Bond has crossed paths with.That said, this will offer no new information to someone who has seen all of the movies. There is nothing new here. In todays world of featurettes and retrospectives on every DVD, this program seems outdated. But by the standards of the day, this was a great way to get caught up on the spy you had (or hadn't) been watching in the theatres.After watching this program, I went out and watched every other Bond movie I could find. I am still a fan today. So, I guess the show served it's purpose.</p>
