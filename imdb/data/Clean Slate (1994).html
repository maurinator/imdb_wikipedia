<h1>Clean Slate (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Pogue is a private eye with a problem: every morning when he wakes up, he has total amnesia, waking up with a 'blank slate'. Since he is in the middle of a hot investigation and has a developing romance, this is less than convenient.</p>
<p>A private eye who suffers total amnesia every 24h is deeply entangled in a complicated murder/theft case.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I loved Clean Slate, very funny movie. I know the critics weren't too crazy about it, but I love it! This film and it's lead actor Dana Carvey, deserve more respect. Though his movies may not be great(with the exception of Wayne's World 1 and 2)he is a very talented comedian. I give this film 4 stars****</p>
