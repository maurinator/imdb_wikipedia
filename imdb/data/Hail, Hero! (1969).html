<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I saw this film as an 11 year old in 1969. Viet-Nam was raging & the country was torn. Hail Hero was a sneak preview at the 163rd Street Theater in North Miami Beach, Florida. Micheal Douglas was strictly known as Kirk's son, and there was a lot of interest to see if he "could" act.The acting is outstanding and so is the story line. Things never seem to change. War has been around since the beginning of time, and so has serving in the military and defending one's country. The most shocking aspect here was the dead mummy baby in the shoe box. Lots of symbolic levels here and it's clear that this movie is no longer out of date.This would be a good movie to remake today. I'd rate Hail Hero as a 10.</p>
