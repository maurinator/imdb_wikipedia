<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite the naysayers, I count "Les Felins" among my all-time favorites. Hey, we're talking of a thriller that was made over 40 years ago ! Lalo Schiffrin's introductory bass riff is as suspenseful as it is masterful.The actors may not have been at their best in 1964 but IMHO they still did a helluva good job with the plot (French Riviera playboy Delon seduces Mob boss' wife; he tells his men, "Bring me back his head!"; Delon is forced into hiding and ends up a prisoner of the sexy ladies who help him escape the Mob.I have not seen the English version but would like to get a copy of the French version with English subtitles.</p>
