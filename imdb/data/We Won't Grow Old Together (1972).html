<h1>We Won't Grow Old Together (1972)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Jean has been married to Francoise for years, but his relationship with his wife has been all but over for a long time. She's hardly ever around, always traveling to Russia for work, and she drifts in and out of the film as well, reflecting the ephemeral nature of their marriage.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This French romantic drama adapted from a novel written by auteur director Maurice Pialat himself, tells the story about a turbulent and passionate relationship between a man named Jean and a woman named Catherine.Maurice Pialat's second feature film "We Won't Grow Old Together" is an uncommonly realistic and naturalistic love-story, driven by its arduous narrative, fierce dialog and varied pace. As the story unfolds, Maurice Pialat moves closer and closer into the minds of the main characters, and with his expressive screenplay and acute camera work, he gives an in-depth and meticulous examination of a romantic relationship between a middle aged couple which is interpreted with authenticity and emotional endurance by Jean Yanne and Marl√®ne Jobert. Like Ingmar Bergman, Mike Nichols, Lindsay Anderson and John Cassavetes, Maurice Pialat reaches a level of realism, intensity and honesty which is admirable to watch. This semi-autobiographical tour-de-force is a rigorous study of character. Recommended for those interested in auteur directors, French cinema, cinema history or romantic dramas from any period. The kind of movie that immediately captures the viewer.</p>
