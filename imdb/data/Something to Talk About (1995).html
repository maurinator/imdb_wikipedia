<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Let's see.. in a large bowl, mix together effortless acting, extremely overlit sets, a  made-for-tv, afterschool special script, cliches about how all men are either pigs  or ineffectual and all women know what they want, obligatory, gap-filling scenes  involving an easy listening pop tune where all the major characters get to dance  together and, finally, the inevitable soft ending where the world gets backtogether, somewhat changed but somehow still the same, and you'll have this"home ec" project of a film. I'm not sure which was worse; the film's existence,  the money I paid to see it or the fact that Julia Roberts was actually paid $12  milllion to act out of this bag. That money should have gone to the "continuity  department" to do its job and actually pay attention tot how many hairstyles Julia  Roberts goes through in each and every scene.</p>
