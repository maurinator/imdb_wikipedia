<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I rented this video, the guy beside me fell in the floor laughing. He said that certainly I could find something better to rent. I told him that I just wasn't in to traditional theater flicks and that this would do just fine. It wasn't any kind of award winner, but still underrated nonetheless. For a Canadian low budget film, it's not bad! It has action, violence, drama, and even some comedy. Two college students embark on a weekend journey only to meet up with three desperate killers who have come back to retrieve their money which was buried in the woods years earlier. The boys survival skills are put to the test. At that point, the movie starts to move at an unbelievable high pace!  The ending is one you have to see to believe. It's usually in the "cheap" section in video stores so at worst you're out a couple of bucks if you don't like it! But, chances are you'll be surprised.</p>
