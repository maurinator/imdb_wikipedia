<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Kramer and Douglas, two former presidents from opposite ends of the political spectrum, become reluctant allies when they become the target of a conspirator in President Haney's administration. The two ex-presidents realize they have an enemy within the government and set out to find evidence that will clear their names. The search takes them across the Southern Appalachians; along the way they meet a homeless couple, thwart kidnapers in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, and find themselves marching in a gay pride parade.</p>
<p>They used to run the country. Now they're running for their lives! Two on-the-lam former Presidents of the United States. Framed in a scandal by the current President and pursued by armed agents, the two squabbling political foes plunge into a desperately frantic search for the evidence that will establish their innocence. As the scramble through the real America, they get an unexpected crash course in how their policies affected the citizens.</p>
<p>Two former U. S. Presidents, hated rivals, join forces to expose the current, corrupt President at the risk of their lives.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>We just happened upon this movie a couple of years ago when looking for some movies to rent.  Somehow we had missed it when the movie had been released and it was new to us.  We figured with Jack Lemmon and James Garner it couldn't be too bad.We thoroughtly enjoyed the movie and think it is one of the funniest movies around.  Lemmon and Garner play against one another perfectly.  After seeing it the first time, we went ahead and purchased the movie.  We have watched it more than a few times and have never grown tired of it.  There are some favorite scenes that we still laugh about even thought we know what is coming.We highly recommend this movie to anyone who is the mood for some good laughs and even some thoughtful moments.  You might not want children to see this because of language and a couple of scenes in bedrooms.</p>
