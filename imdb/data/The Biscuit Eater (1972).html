<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film, while not particularly inspired, does a very good job with the story of two boys who are trying to train a bird dog.  There is a nasty neighbor and a few other plot developments that throw a hitch in their plans, but the film is quietly solid all the way.  It might be a little too laid back for the kids of today, but in 1972 teenagers were more tolerant.The cast is part of the reason the film works.  Johnny Whitaker, looking not much older than his days on Family Affair, and George Spell were completely convincing as friends.  The wonderful Beah Richards also helps the film along as George's mother.  Earl Holliman and Pat Crowley are Johnny's parents, and Holliman always could be counted on to give a great performance.  It's just a small film that shines quietly.</p>
