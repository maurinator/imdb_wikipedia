<h2> Summaries </h2>

<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The James Cameron film is a big-budget Hollywood studio disaster/action movie, in which the main characters are fabrications who are not based on historical fact. This television series is a sober and serious drama that tells the story of class conflict and tragedy, based on real life characters who actually were present on the voyage. They are two different things. I was very moved by this version. It takes patience and attention to detail to appreciate the emotional momentum that builds to the final episode. Special effects are not the focus here--appreciate the subtlety of the writing and the fine performances of the actors involved.</p>
