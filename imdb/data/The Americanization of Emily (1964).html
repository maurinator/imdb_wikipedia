<h1>The Americanization of Emily (1964)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>During the build-up to D-Day in 1944, the British found their island hosting many thousands of American soldiers who were "oversexed, overpaid, and over here". That's Charlie Madison exactly; he knows all the angles to make life as smooth and risk-free as possible for himself. But things become complicated when he falls for an English woman, and his commanding officer's nervous breakdown leads to Charlie being sent on a senseless and dangerous mission.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the D-Day invasion, Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Madison has to admit that he's having a pretty good war. He's the personal aide to Adm. William Jessup and Charlie is, if anything, making sure the admiral gets whatever he wants. Liquor, good food and girls are Charlie's specialty and for Emily Barham, a driver who's been assigned to him, he's everything that she dislikes about Americans. Too loud, too rich and too wasteful. For his part Charlie, a self-proclaimed coward, just wants to stay out of action. When Admiral Jessup suffers a nervous breakdown however, Charlie finds himself on a zany assignment to film the arrival in Normandy of combat engineers. Meanwhile, Charlie and Emily have very much fallen in love.</p>
<p>An American naval officer's talent for living the good life in wartime is challenged when he falls in love and is sent on a dangerous mission.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>There can be no Paddy Chayefsky without comedy, nor can there be without drama.  His work is always serious, channeled with humor, but his presentation is so on-point, so honest, so blatant, that as viewers we are forced to soak it all up, and we are left the better for it.Set in wartime, the Americanization of Emily looks at changing times in a very changing world. The balloon will go up' any day now, signaling the Invasion of Europe and all around will be forever changed.It is not solely the warriors, the decision makers, that are central to the battle. Chayefsky knows that, and shows us that war will change all it touches, from the simple Emily (Julie Andrews), a kind, intelligent, sensitive single English woman to the devil-may-care scrounger', Lt Cmdr Charles Madison  (James Garner-somewhat a reprise of his role in The Great Escape).This movie is a romance, and a serious examination of people over-matched by forces outside their control, who struggle to do everything in their control to find their way.A well-told story, skillfully delivered. It's hard to ask for much more than that.</p>
