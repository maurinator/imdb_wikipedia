<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A group of Confederate prisoners escape to Canada and plan to rob the banks and set fire to the small town of Saint Albans in Vermont.

<p>Van Heflin As Maj. Neal Benton</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Van Heflin is a confederate officer disguised as a businessman, who is planning to raid the town of St. Albans, near the Canadian border. He gets emotionally involved with his landlady Anne Bancroft and her son, and eventually with the town's people. This is going to make his mission become much harder. Heflin gives a great performance, you can feel the agony he is going through. This is not an easy film to see, because you feel with him and it becomes almost unbearable. But it shows very well the horror of a war between people which  were alike, but had a different cause.</p>
