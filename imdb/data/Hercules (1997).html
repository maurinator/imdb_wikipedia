Hercules becomes a famous hero with the help of his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr. Hercules battles monsters, Hades and the Titans, but it is his self-sacrifice to rescue his love Meg which makes him a true hero.</p>
<p>After the monstrous Titans were imprisoned by the powerful Zeus, a baby was born to Zeus whom he names Hercules. But when Hercules is suddenly stolen from Mt Olympus by Pain and Panic, the henchmen of the villainous Lord of the Underworld Hades, he is stripped of his godly appearance but keeps his godly strength. Raised among the mortal world as a human, Hercules is confused about where he belongs. Hercules is told that if he proves to be a true hero on Earth, his true form as a god will be restored. So he learns from a satyr named Philoctetes all the ways of being a hero. But his journey towards his return home as a god is suddenly put to a halt when he crosses paths with a beautiful Dame named Meg, who works in secret for Hades.

Olympus from Hades, who plans to overthrow Zeus to rule Olympus forever.</p>

Hades is sent to rule the underworld, but he makes plans to throw Zeus out of Mount Olympus with the Titans' help. The three Fates warn him that his plans would be endangered if Hercules, Zeus newborn child, is still around by the time he tries to take over Mount Olympus. Hades sends Pain and Panic to turn Hercules into a mortal and kill him, but they fail in their attempt and leave him on earth with his divine strength to be raised as a human.

<p>The son of the Greek Gods Zeus and Hera is stripped of his immortality as an infant and must become a true hero in order to reclaim it.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I don't usually like villains, even in Disney movies, because they're too scary, but I loved James Woods as Hades.  He was so funny.  I loved the way he called Megara "my little nutmeg."  I also loved the way they depicted Thebes like New York and they called it "the big olive."  I loved Meg's cynical and sarcastic attitude.  Hercules himself was rather bland.  I loved the song "Go the Distance."  Paul Wylie skated to it and showed how powerful the song is.  I really enjoyed this movie and I don't care if it departs from Greek mythology.  It was really about our time anyway.  I'd watch it again in a Pelopenisian minute.</p>
