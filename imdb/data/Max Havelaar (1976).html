<h1>Max Havelaar (1976)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>An idealistic Dutch colonial officer posted to Indonesia in the 19th century is cohvinced that he can make the kinds of changes that will actually help the local people he is in charge of, but circumstances soon make him realize just how out of touch he really is, and it doesn't take long for things to go from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Just after assistant resident (colonial district chief) Slotering of Lebak, on Java, reproaches his dinner host the regent (native feudal ruler) to over-exert the local commoners, he dies of poisoning. The post goes to naive idealist Max Havelaar, who means his oath of officer to protect the locals. He hopes paying the native officials better, even advances at his own expense, will allow them to fulfill their family obligations. After Max finds the abuses continues, even worse now than he imagined, a test of force starts, which ruins many lives, mainly but not only native. Interwoven is the story of Sa√Ødjah's farming family and their water buffaloes.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>in making this film, rademaker opened up old dutch colonial wounds, dormant except for the novel, helped promote a good NGO cause, & exposed native corruption that continues into present indonesia. the max havelaar foundation was ahead of its time in promoting fair trade & continues to take a leadership role today. in the film, havelaar represents the idealist side of both dutch colonial rule & protestant ethos in the face of corruption & hypocrisy toward that global enterprise. aside from a brilliant film, powerful scenery & location, excellent acting, rademaker wove the narration close to the well-known novel. appropriate for its time,this film fits well with European self-examination of its colonial past, resonates with pontecorvo's burn/queimada, a masteropiece of duplicity & brando at his prime!</p>
