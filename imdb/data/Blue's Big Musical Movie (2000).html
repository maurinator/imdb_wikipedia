<h1>Blue's Big Musical Movie (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Blue and the gang decide to put on a musical show in the back yard.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Hmm..any chance for another Pokemon? Don't think so, this show is made for 3-8, you miss out on that whole 9-12 crowd which is the main child population who goes to see movies. Still think it will do well though. Thank goodness this show has more to it than the Care Bears though, parents took me to that. Almost walked out they were so bored. Blue is amusing and cute.</p>
