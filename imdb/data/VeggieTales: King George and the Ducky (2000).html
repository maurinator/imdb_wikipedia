<h1>VeggieTales: King George and the Ducky (2000)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>King George, unlike most kings, spends most of his time in the bathtub, playing with his favorite toy - a rubber ducky. But George isn't satisfied with just his rubber ducky - he wants all the duckies! The king learns a lesson in humility from his brave soldier Thomas, whose ducky George had stolen. Eventually, George faces his sin and learns that it's always important to share with others.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>One notch up from Lyle the Friendly Viking, this Veggie Tale also fell a bit short on the laughs and outrageous, original humor associated with the past and future Veggie Tales videos. It's still worth seeing, just not the best.John</p>
