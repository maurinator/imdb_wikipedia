<p>David Taylor, an archaeology student in the middle of completing a graduate thesis, is looking for a little adventure in his life.

But David's best-laid plans start to go astray when he suspects that his professor has an incredible secret hidden in his past -- a secret so important, so unbelievable, that it will have socioreligious repercussions throughout the world. And at its center is an ancient Latin manuscript -- a manuscript which is now in David's hands.</p>
