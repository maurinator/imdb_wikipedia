<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Despite the fact that you have a good cast, this fails to be a good film, merely because of the script and direction. It is dull from start to finish, and apart from a scene where Ray Milland and Joan Fontaine are reading a script together and then kiss, there is nothing to commend it. I'm not particularly a fan of Theresa Wright, and although her performance may be commendable, she doesn't grow or develop in the part. It is one- dimensional from beginning to end. Having said that, it doesn't harm any of their careers. Fontaine would go on to do 'Ivanhoe' in the same year, and Milland would go on to do 'Dial M For Murder' with Hitchcock. This suggests that as an actor you should do as many films as possible so that the good ones can cancel out the bad ones.</p>
