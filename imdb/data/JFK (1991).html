<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whether you agree with Jim Garrison's conspiracy theory or not, Stone's film  is an effective mystery. The pieces of the puzzle are put together with great skill so that the  viewer is kept involved despite the length of the film. The John Williams  score helps to build the atmosphere of intrigue and confusion. Costner is  rather bland, as usual, but that works well here since he is surrounded by  such an interesting group of colorful characters. This is definitely a good mystery -- and a frightening one if even part of  the conspiracy theory has validity.</p>
