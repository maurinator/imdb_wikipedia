<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>As far as anthology films go, it's hard to beat this one. It's got a great early 70's campiness about it that gets better each time I watch it. It not the easiest film to find (I've only seen it at ONE video store in the midwest US) and if you do track it down on the old Nostalgia Merchant label it's cut. There are quite a few scenes out of place and some cut altogether (most notably the "vampire sequence"). It's too bad Fox couldn't pick this up and distribute it along with "Tales From The Crypt". Overall, I highly recommend this film and suggest getting your hands on a UNCUT Japanese import.</p>
