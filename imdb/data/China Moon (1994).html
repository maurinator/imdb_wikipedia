<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Happened to catch this thriller on cable yesterday night.  I am not a fan of Ed Harris but I can say that he is a good actor putting up a decent performance in this show.It also goes to show that you do not necessary need to have awesome special effects, elaborate sets or costumes to make a movie captivating.  Just a good story plot (keeping in mind that the audience are not morons or idiots) and a few good actors/actress is just enough to keep people glued to their seats.It is really rare to find such movies lately.  Really hope to see such movies that will keep people thinking what will come next, as the saying goes, its the story that counts and not blow-your-mind-but-forgot-about-it special effects or actors/actress or is that cardboards walking down the aisle with pretty clothes trying to act etc, etc.Just intelligent story telling which people will still talked about it when they leave the threaters.</p>
