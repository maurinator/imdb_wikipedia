<h1>Hilary and Jackie (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>British sisters Hilary du Pré and Jacqueline du Pré are both talented musicians, Hilary a flautist, Jackie a cellist. With regard to their musical prowess, they have always had a friendly competitive nature with each other, fueled in large part by the want of their pianist mother, Iris, for them to achieve musical greatness. But underlying this friendliness is a deep desire to be truly better than the other. Despite or perhaps in part because of her flamboyant performance style, the younger Jackie emerges from the shadows of older Hilary's more triumphant childhood successes to become the renowned musician in the family. Although both continue with their music and both end up marrying (Hilary to Kiffer Finzi, and Jackie to pianist Daniel Barenboim), Hilary focuses on her home life, whereas Jackie focuses on her career. A seemingly odd request by Jackie to Hilary is later understood, but Hilary's agreement to that request demonstrates the true nature of their loving but unusual sisterly relationship.</p>
<p>This movie tells the true story of the tragic life of the brilliant international concert cellist Jacqueline Du Pré and her sister, Hilary. Despite starting out in music together, Hilary chooses a more normal life in having a husband and children. Jacqueline gets married too but can never seem to quite achieve the happiness of the mundane life Hilary has and Hilary's devotion to her sister causes them to take some rather drastic measures in their lives. The irony of having a great musical ability fades away as Jacqueline transcends into a slow decline when struck with a deadly illness.</p>
<p>The tragic story of world renowned classic cellist Jacqueline du Pré, as told from the point of view of her sister, flautist Hilary du Pré-Finzi.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Hilary and Jackie" tells of two sisters who share a love of classical music and each other but take contrasting paths through adult life. A much lauded film worthy of its critical acclaim, "H&J" does have a peculiar twice-told tale approach to its presentation which tends to make it interesting but so complex as to dilute its effectiveness. Nonetheless, this British film with a typically "stiff upper lip" approach to its sentimentality, is well shot, scripted, and acted. A good watch which will be a little "over the top" for many.</p>
