<h1>Camilla (1994)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Vincent and Freda Lopez are a young married Toronto couple who both indulge in the arts, Vince as an artist and Freda as a musician/composer. Their marriage is not as secure as it may seem on the surface as Vince sees Freda's music as purely a hobby, while she sees it as her vocation, despite feeling insecure about it. The two drive to Savannah, Georgia for a vacation, where they meet mother and son Camilla and Harold Cara, a former concert violinist and a B-movie producer respectively. There is an immediate bond between Camilla and Freda because of their music, and because of the unconditional support Camilla provides to Freda concerning her music that Vince will or cannot. Their bond is also despite the obvious exaggerated stories Camilla tells of her life. After Vince and Harold leave to work on a joint project and after Freda and Vince have an argument following about her musical career, Freda asks Camilla to drive back to Toronto with her to attend a concert of Brahms' violin concerto at the Winter Garden Theatre, which would mirror Camilla's own performance of the same piece at the same venue years earlier. Camila accepts. The women's journey is not only filled with adventure (especially after a mishap with Vince's car) but also one of coming to terms with their past and their future. Meanwhile, Vince and Harold come back to Savannah to find the two women gone. As Vince and Harold look for Freda and Camilla, each of the men eventually have to reconcile their own broken relationship with the woman in their respective life.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I just started watching this movie, and so far, so good! we'll see if it hold my attention.. I think I've gotta see Jess in her last film though. a true icon! She had an appeal that we don't see often in films these days. Bridgette Fonda seems to be comfortable, yet so young in this role. I think that may be what is causing discomfort in some as wee watch. She seemed so young in comparison to "Single White Female"..Perhaps that's why she wasn't able to sell the role to everyone. A little too cutesy perhaps .. I agree, though..It's fun to watch a movie that you have no clue about! I have never heard of this movie, but, it's a good middle of the night flick! A little slow-moving perhaps, but, I think I can deal.. Hey!! A great weekend flick! A date flick? Definitely..</p>
