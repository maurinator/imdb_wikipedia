<h1>Lady Godiva of Coventry (1955)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>In 11th-century England, King Edward the Confessor wants saxon Lord Leofric to marry a despised Norman woman, and has him jailed when he refuses. In jail, he meets Godiva, the sheriff's daughter, and soon they are wed. The times are turbulent and Godiva proves a militant bride; unhistorically, unrest between the Anglo-Saxon populace and the increasingly influential Norman French lead to her famous ride.</p>
<p>Fictionalized account of events leading up the famous nude ride (alas, her hair covers everything) of the militant Saxon lady.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The sole raison d'être for this forgettable film is to exploit the legend of Lady Godiva, who in medieval times supposedly expressed her social protests by riding naked through the city on horseback... Not surprisingly, the movie did less than deliver the titillating ride that many in the audience may have expected...A thin story line revolving around a battle between the Saxons and the Normans is developed, with Clint Eastwood taking a drop in screen credits from this low-budget adventure  a tedious embroidered 'hotchpotch' spectacle of Norman intrigue in Eleventh Century England, as the foreigners try to share and conquer the Saxon earl..Maureen O'Hara plays the gentlewoman famous for her legendary ride while nude through Coventry... Is it to prove the loyalty of the Saxons? Godiva is the wife of Leofric (George Nader) earl of Mercia, who brings under control the Saxon shrew...The film is a comic strip fictitious account...</p>
