<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The first time I saw this movie, there was some emotional moments. Gibson's acting is the best on the world. He plays a cab driver (Jerry Fletcher) in love with Julia Roberts(Alice Sutton), he has theories about conspiracies. He puts his theories on a newsletter called "Conspiracy Theory", they're never right, so no one gives a damn about it. But now, one of his theories is right, but he doesn't know which one and the only person he trusts is the person he loves.In terms of romance, Consp. Theory was better then Titanic. How? Let's see: In Titanic, DiCaprio meets Winslet, three days later, she strips for him and they have sex in the back seat of the car. Is that love? Or teenage sex? In Conspiracy Theory, he met Alice for six months, he's in love with her, but he's shy, he doesn't just meet her and sleep with her. And what's more romantic? The guy dies and she stays alive and stays sad for the rest of her life (Titanic)? Or they both live and live happy ever after (Conspiracy Theory)? I'll give a 9 out of 10.</p>
