Then Suresh meets with d√©butante Shanti and falls head over heels in love with her and begins to promote her career. Veena, on the other hand, dislikes the film industry and does not want it to influence Pramila, as a result disagreements arise between her and Suresh, and they decide to separate, with Pramila staying on with her dad. Then things take a turn for the worse when Veena's dad, Rai Bahadur B.P. Varma brings about a legal action against Suresh for custody of Pramila. The Court decides in Varma's favor and Pramila moves in with her mom and grandparents.

Shanti is compelled by a Court decision to return to acting and to comply with her contract, while Suresh tries for a comeback as an extra in a movie with lead actress being Shanti. The question remains will Suresh make a successful start as an actor, and will Shanti and he start a relationship?</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is really a milestone in world cinema - not just Indian cinema. The story, the lyrics, songs, music, photography, editing and above all class act. Everyone has poured their heart in this film. This indeed is a poetry in form of a film. Though the topic is very depressing it but reflects reality from eyes of a defeatist, maybe the only flaw I see in the picture, and perhaps the reason why the film never saw a good box office record. However, it may have a lot to do with personal struggles of Guru Dutt at the time of making of this film. Only if the film had been about triumph of human struggle to overcome all odds, outcomes could have been different. A lot of credit is given to Guru Dutt alone, however I feel the classic nature of this film has a lot to do with contribution of everyone - the music is touching today as I suppose it might have been then. One who has never seen Wahida Rehman in younger days is dazed at her beauty and innocence. Guru Dutt himself looks rather handsome. Kaifi Azmi's lyrics are just inimitable. Photography is great - considering it was done in 50a. I came up with the DVD by chance and I'm now going to see more of Guru Dutt's work. I not for a moment want to deny Guru Dutt his share of glory, however one must also acknowledge other geniuses who made this movie a classic!</p>
