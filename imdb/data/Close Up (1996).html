<h1>Close Up (1996)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>A Belgian filmmaker in New York is placed under suspicion of having committed a brutal killing-spree in a bar, when interrogated by detectives he can't seem to place himself at the crime scene or killing anybody. While in custody things are beginning to look worse when a media-circus evolves around him.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie represents an incredible impact achieved with few resources. I was especially amazed by the creative placement of well-made raw film material showed within the movie, it determined most of the gritty setting throughout the movie. With "Close Up" being Przemyslaw Reut's director and screenwriter debut, he really did a brilliant job at both of them. The story is well-written and in such a way that it relies much on the viewer's own interpretation. The actors Michael Mauro and Eric Leffler portrayed very realistically characters that everybody is familiar with in some way through real life. Mauro playing an aspiring filmmaker from Belgium named Stefan van der Berg, a main suspect in a gruesome shooting spree he can't recall and Leffler playing a lawyer with a shark grin named Joseph Kline, seeking fame and fortune through the case of Stefan.I think the movie was additionally trying to show a dark side of New York, but it surely succeeded at showing a dark side of human nature and it's secret intentions.</p>
