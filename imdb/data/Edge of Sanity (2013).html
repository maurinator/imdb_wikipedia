<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Brookvale Mental Hospital is an old facility set in a remote area in West Virginia, USA. They still implement 70's style mental health care and are lacking funds to meet strict up-to-date qualifications to run their facility due to the Head Administrator's greed. They continue to hire staff and take patients with only a few knowing the truth. The staff seem to have everything under control but they don't. Their flaws, quirks, weaknesses start to show. The patients who are clinically diagnosed with certain mental illnesses seem at times to be saner than the staff. Will Dr. Nathan Wallace single handedly take over the greedy Head Administrator's job? Will Dr. Nathan Wallace win support from staff and patients? Will Samuel Stevens then take over Dr. Nathan Wallace's job after he comes to the good side after Margo Gyllenhal's coaxing? Or will Samuel Stevens continue supporting the Head Administrator and portray a good doctor all the while deceiving patients? Will the Head Administrator change his ways with the encouragement from Nurse Gertrude? There is alot of history between the Head Administrator and Nurse Gertrude. On one hand, she still loves him and tries to support him but cannot hurt patients. Occasionally he checks on her to see if she is loyal to him. Is she loyal to him or to the patients? She goes back and forth. She is confused. Who will she eventually side with?</p>
