<h1>The Outsider (1974)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Lou calls Mary, Murray and Ted in for an early morning emergency meeting. Their already low ratings are slipping even further, and he has to do something about the problem. He has decided to hire a consultant with the job title program coordinator, whose responsibility it will be to find where the problem or problems lie. He hires a young whippersnapper named Bob Larson, who is only two years out of journalism school. Mary, Murray and Ted are somewhat concerned about the authority Bob will have. Ted is even more concerned that Bob will have the authority to fire. After two weeks of Bob being on the job, morale has never been lower at the station especially as most staff don't believe that Bob's numerous suggested changes have made the show better but worse. But a one point increase in ratings over Bob's tenure cannot be ignored. As the staff becomes buoyed by this revelation, Bob drops a bombshell of news on them, which makes them reevaluate their priorities as a news organization.</p>
<p>The consultant hired to change the WJM News makes changes that seem to annoy everyone.</p>
