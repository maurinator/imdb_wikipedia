<p>Jack Manfred is a struggling novelist in London. To make ends meet, he sells his beloved car and, through connections through his South African father, gets a job as a croupier at the Golden Lion Casino, a second tier casino in London. Jack had previous training as such back in South Africa. He doesn't particularly like being a croupier, but he's good at it and finds a certain pleasure in watching gamblers, for who he has disdain, lose. His girlfriend, Marion, an ex-police officer, doesn't like his new job either despite the money it is bringing into the household. The casino has a strict set of employee policies, including no gambling ever, no relationships with other casino employees and no fraternizing at all with the gamblers - also known as the punters - outside of the casino. Although Jack cannot tolerate cheaters, he is not averse to bending these employee rules when it suits his fancy. As time goes on, he begins to observe casino life with a certain distance, through the eyes of "Jake", the main character in his novel and his alter ego. Jack allows Jake to do things he would never do himself just to see how the story plays out.</p>
<p>An aspiring writer is hired as a croupier at a casino, where he realizes that his life as a croupier would make a great novel.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Jack Manfield is a writer but an unpublished one thus far. With money running out he follows a connection from his father that earns him a job interview in a London casino. After a short time he finds he has rediscovered the croupier bug and is back in love with his new job. He also finds that his experiences useful in creating a new book, lead the lead character, Jake, as a croupier. As he drifts apart from his girlfriend he loses himself in the world and starts breaking the rules  ultimately getting involved with a patron, Jani, who asks him for help in organising a heist at the casino.Quite often it'll be the UK, European or underground markets that expose an American film as a good film after the US market has ignored it, but with Croupier it worked the other way round. Hardly making any impact at all upon release in the UK, it was apparently good reviews and good figures from the US that helped make it better known. As such I came to it with mixed expectations  I sort of half knew what to expect from it but I had also been led to believe that it would impress me a great deal. In some regards I enjoyed the film; it is intelligent, dark, thoughtful and has a reasonably enjoyable plot  even if the plot does have equal billing with the atmosphere. However don't expect a great plot that piles twist on twist, because this isn't what the film is about. Rather the film relies very heavily on the observations of the croupier himself (both as Jack and Jake) to drive the film forward. I can't think of another film that I've seen that uses voice-over to such a degree (and makes it work), usually heavy voice-over use implies that the script and characters were not strong enough to hold the film up by themselves.The clever twisting of Jack/Jake is subtle but done to good effect and was a big part of the reason that this film engaged me. Outside of this I found the plot to be rather hard work  there is no one real thrust to the film with only the main one involving Jani really coming out to the front in order to deliver an ending in the traditional manner. This is a weakness and it stops the film being as satisfying as it could have been, with Jack not being provided with enough of a plot to be set in. That said it still works due to his character and some great direction from Hodges who avoids being overly flashy as the gambling world setting often encourages directors to be.Owen is very good and convinces in his many scenes  he is the heart of the film and it is to his credit that he manages to do it. Even in voice-over he delivers good character and direction for the film. Kingston is not as good. Aside from doing her whole nudity thing yet again she also is lumbered with an accent that doesn't suit her and one that she doesn't sound comfortable with (even if it isn't that bad). McKee is OK, as are Ball, Morton and Parnell albeit in smaller roles. But in a film that is more about the croupier than anything else, the film is Owen's and he rises to it and does well with the lead role. Overall this is an OK film and one that deserves better than it received upon first release in the UK. However plot-wise it is not as satisfying as I would have liked it to be, instead it relies heavily on the character of Jack  an aspect that is both the film's making and it's weakness (in that the film doesn't give him a good enough plot to be developed against).</p>
