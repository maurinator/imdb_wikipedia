<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>When I heard when they were coming out with "Next Friday" and got the news that Chris Tucker wasn't coming back, I thought it was going to be jake. But when I finally went to the movies to see it, it turned out to be better than the first. The only differences are that Craig (Ice Cube) has gone from South Central L.A. to the suburbs. Deebo went to prison and is out for revenge with his dingy little brother. And he's staying with his funny uncle, his whining cousin, and his uncle's "friendly" girlfriend. I laughed harder on "Next Friday" than I did the first one and you will too. So, Cube and Pooh hurry up and get back together on that new "Friday". PLEASE!</p>
