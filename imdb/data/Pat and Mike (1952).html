<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon specifically wrote this screenplay because of Katharine Hepburn's real sports ability.This is a terrific comedy and a great vehicle for Hepburn and Spencer Tracy....this gives Tracy a chance to play a Brooklyn sports thug.  Very funny.Also, this is a rare chance to see some famous Women golfers of the early 1950's on film...not mention a great performance by Jim Backus.George Cukor's direction is relaxed and natural.There's also a funny set-piece with Hepburn having a panic attack during a tennis match.A great movie.</p>
