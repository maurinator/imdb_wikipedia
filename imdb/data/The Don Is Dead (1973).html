<h1>The Don Is Dead (1973)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>After his mistress is savagely beaten up a Mafia leader goes after the killer with a bloody vengeance. Soon after the hunt begins, a gang war ensues.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Like quite a few other of the 70's crime dramas that were not classics, but still of more grit and consequence than many of those churned out in the last two decades, this interestingly plotted mob film is a frustrating mix of a really good scene or two followed by a painfully predictable and badly presented one.  Anthony Quinn is top billed but largely wasted as the boss whose romantic liaison triggers a war of wills and weapons with some headstrong younger members (led by Robert Forster, Frederic Forrest and Al Lettieri.)  Some good action scenes follow, but, like the rest of the film, some of them are quite impressive while others fall flat.  A mixed bag, not often seen but worth watching, with limited expectations.</p>
