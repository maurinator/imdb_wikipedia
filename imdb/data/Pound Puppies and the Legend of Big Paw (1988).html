<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>I love this movie! I knocked off one point for the animation - it is mismatched sometimes with the audio - but the story is a very good one and the songs are excellent! I used to rent this movie EVERY time I went to the movie store when I was little. It is what began my love of music from the 1950s. I recently purchased it on Ebay and I enjoyed it just as much as a college student as I did as a child.Besides entertainment, "Pound Puppies: The Legend of Big Paw" teaches several worth while lessons: Rumors aren't always true, why you shouldn't "cry wolf," sometimes scary things can be "all in your mind," and that love is stronger than evil.The nose knows what the nose knows and the nose knows this is a great movie!</p>
