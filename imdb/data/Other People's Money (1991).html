<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Another Danny DeVito triumph.  He always gives a strong performance.  An excellent cast including Penelope Miller, Gregory Peck and Dean Jones. This film welcomes you to the real world of business take overs and DeVito pulls it off convincingly.  Clever dialogue and good pace make for an entertaining film.  I rated this an 8.</p>
