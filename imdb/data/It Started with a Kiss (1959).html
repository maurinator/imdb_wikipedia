<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"It Started With a Kiss" is a movie that has several funny story elements but the overall picture never quite works. Much of it is because the characters (particularly Debbie Reynolds') don't make much sense and were poorly written.When the film begins, an Air Force sergeant tries repeatedly to pick up a model working at a charity event. Joe (Glenn Ford) is boorishly persistent...something considered acceptable in films back in the day, though with changing attitudes he'd DEFINITELY fall into the category of a sexual harasser today! Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) isn't impressed and repeated tells him to get lost. In a last ditch effort to get her, he kisses her...and apparently is such a stud that she falls for him and they immediately marry. Does this make sense? No.Two days later, Joe is flown to duty in Spain and she is to follow a month later. During this time period, she learns that Joe's lone raffle ticket from the charity event was THE winner...and he's the new owner of the Ford Futura--a one-of-a-kind concept car*. She writes Joe that she has a huge surprise for him. He, oddly, assumes that means she's pregnant...but considering they only were apart a couple weeks at this point, you can only assume Joe is a total moron and knows nothing about sex education. Even if she WAS pregnant (which she wasn't), she wouldn't have known for sure for at least a couple months. Does this make sense? Nah.While in Spain, the Air Force personnel are told to not be ostentatious about money and be conservative...and then Maggie shows up with the spectacular car! However, when Joe's commanding officer tries talking with her, she repeatedly treats him like crap...and with open contempt. So, your husband is a sergeant and your wife is mouthy with the Major. Does this make sense? Nope.After Maggie arrives, she has the bright idea that because they really didn't know each other AND because they have little in common other than sexual attraction. Because of this, she insists that they sleep apart. Does this make sense? Not much...and there are a lot of scenes showing a VERY frustrated Joe!Soon, the couple learns that they are in serious trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. Why? Because they won a $40,000 car (probably worth about $200,000-300,000 in today's money)...and they owe $17,000 in taxes on the car...on a sergeant's salary!! They never even thought of this!! Does this couple seem like they have a brain between them? Nah...especially when Maggie doesn't seem to understand that they cannot keep it!Later, the General is upset (and understandably so) because not only has the Sergeant been showing off by driving around with the car but he sells it to a bullfighter for $17,000. So, Joe just eats the $23,000 difference...and the bullfighter was 'willing to pay ANYTHING to get the car'! And, now he's in trouble with the General. So what dumb thing do they do? Maggie begins yelling at the General and threatening him!The film goes on and on like this...with two really incredibly stupid people doing incredibly stupid things. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the audience to care about these dodos...especially Maggie. The bottom line is that the film has amusing moments but the overall picture just doesn't make sense or work well. All you know is that Joe and Maggie are stupid...but have great sexual chemistry together. All in all, a very disappointing film with little to recommend it other than the car!*This bright red Futura went on to become very famous. Hollywood paid to have it completely restyled and repainted and it became the Batmobile on the "Batman" TV show! I am sure today it's worth considerably more than $40,000. In fact, it recently was sold for $4.62 million!!!</p>
