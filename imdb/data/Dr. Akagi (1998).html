<h1>Dr. Akagi (1998)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dr. Akagi, a rural physician in Japan during WWII, wages a one-man crusade against hepetitis, earning him a reputation as "Dr. Liver." But his fanatic campaign brings him into disfavor with the Japanese army, and as the war seems more and more hopeless for the Japanese, Dr. Akagi finds himself increasingly a scapegoat.</p>
<p>At the end of WWII, Japanese doctor Akagi searches for the cure for hepatitis in the prisoner-of-war camp.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Imamura Shohei has come in to his prime at a point when most directors of his age begin their downward spiral. Along with his completely different although equally impressive film, "Unagi (the eel)" (1997) Imamura has made two of the greatest films of the 1990s.  This particular entry into the Imamura canon deals with a Kyushu doctor during WWII.  Of course, the film goes way beyond just that; it's a film that cannot be summed up in words, it's the kind of movie that you sit back and enjoy and you come out of smiling, for you've been entertained in a way most films cannot.  "Kanzo Sensei" affects like a truly satisfying book does, something most films cannot come close to copying. If you dig it, rent "the eel" and look out for his next work coming soon to a theatre far from you and me--Japan.  Let's hope his next one is as good as his last two, and that it is released in theatrically in the US. Highly recommended.</p>
