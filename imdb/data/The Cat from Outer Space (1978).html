<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The Cat From Outer Space was a troubled shoot, with a severe personality clash between it's two stars.The film involves, as you might guess from the title, a cat. From outer space. Except the cat, "Jake", looks suspiciously like an Earth cat. If this were modern-day Disney then sophisticated CGI would be used to at least make Jake's mouth move. Yet this was 1978 and we had to settle for Jake being "telepathic" and looking in vaguely the right direction.But while Jake  played by two cats, a boy and a girl  may act on cue, his body language tells a different story. Whenever he/she is picked up by Frank (Ken Berry), Jake's tail flashes furiously, despite the on-screen buddy-buddy nature of their relationship. I don't know what Berry made of Jake, but it's obvious the cat wasn't his biggest fan and didn't like being handled.I imagine that Hollywood egos came into effect, Jake demanding a bigger trailer. The sex, the drinking, the catnip. Finally, his claim that "I'm worth $20 million a picture" would have sunk his movie star prospects.Berry went on to appear in Featherstone's Nest, The Golden Girls and The Legend of Forrest Tucker. For Jake (Rumpler/Amber), this amiable, likeable family comedy was the only role in his short-lived career.FILM'S LASTING INSPIRATION: A scene where Jake the alien cat is in the basket of a (motor)bike ridden by Frank and makes it fly in the air to avoid capture. Mr. Spielberg, were you watching?</p>
