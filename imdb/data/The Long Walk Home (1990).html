<h1>The Long Walk Home (1990)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Dramatizes the events in 1955-1956 in Montgomery, Alabama, when blacks boycotted public transport becuase they were forced to sit at the back. Odessa works as a maid for the Thompsons, and as well as she is treated, she feels it is her duty to walk to work, even if it means she is exhaused, and gets to work late.</p>
<p>Two women, black and white, in 1955 Montgomery Alabama, must decide what they are going to do in response to the famous bus boycott lead by Martin Luther King.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Whoopie Goldberg got gypped in 1990, when she was nominated for, and won Best SUPPORTING actress for the movie "Ghost".  THIS was the movie she should have been nominated for; in the BEST ACTRESS category.  This was one of the finest performances of the year, and definitely of Ms. Goldberg's career.  Regrettably, she is too well remembered as a comedienne.  People forget how well she handles drama.  This is a performance worth seeing. Sissy Spacek is fresh and forthright; and the story manages to be didactic without being heavy handed.</p>
