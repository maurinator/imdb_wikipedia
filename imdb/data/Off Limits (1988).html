<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>McGriff and Albaby are probably doing the worst law enforcement job in the world - they are plain clothes U.S. military policemen on duty in war-time Saigon. However, their job becomes even harder when they start investigating the serial killings of local prostitutes. Their prime suspect is high ranking U.S. Army officer which brings their lives in danger.</p>
<p>In Saigon, during the Vietnam war, Buck McGriff and Albaby Perkins are U.S. Military Policemen trying to do law enforcement in a chaotic city. When a prostitute is executed in bed, they investigate and they find a witness - the G.I. Maurice that is scared since the killer is an American officer. However Maurice is murdered and soon they find that there are six other prostitutes that have been murdered but their cases have vanished from the files. They meet the former investigator that gives a copy of his findings and they have five colonels as prime suspects that might be the serial-killer, but their friend Sargeant Dix warns that only three of them were in Saigon in the night of the last murder. McGriff finds that Sister Nicole has a witness hidden in the jungle with the Vietcong and he tries to convince her to let them meet her to find who the serial-killer is.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Gregory Hines and Willem Dafoe make an excellent team in this unusual murder mystery set in Vietnam.Actual filming overseas add to the realism.Anyone ever serving in the Pacific can attest to that.The soundtrack was great, using music not usually heard in most of the Vietnam movies.Supporting actors performances were also very good ( Fred ward, Amanda Pays ).I have collected all the Vietnam movies and rate this one of the best.</p>
