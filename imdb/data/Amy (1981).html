<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>"Amy" is the story of a woman's crusade to teach deaf children how to communicate at the turn of the century.  It's not the film the original "Miracle Worker" is, but it's effective in it's own way.  Jenny Agutter is the star of the film, and she makes it work.  The impact of her loss and how much it affected her is pivotal to the film, and she's wonderful in the role.  I shed a few tears during my initial viewing of the movie, and while it's not a tearjerker it's subject matter is emotional.  It's not available anywhere at the moment, but if you can find it, it's worth a look.</p>
