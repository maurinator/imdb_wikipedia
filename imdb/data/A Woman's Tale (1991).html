<h1>A Woman's Tale (1991)</h1>
<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Uplifting and intimate look at the last days of an elderly cancer victim. The film is even more relevant as it was written specifically for the lead actress, Sheila Florance, who was in fact dying of cancer as she created what is essentially a self-portrait.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This movie is one of the greatest of all times, along with Chushingura, The Burmese Harp, Ken Russell's 'Women In Love' and the Aussie Movie, 'Bliss'(not american version)....  Moves you and makes me glad to be alive, great acting, great film techniques, shows don't need a big budget to make a beautiful film above the crap from Hollywood.</p>
