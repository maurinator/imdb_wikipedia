<h2> Summaries </h2>
<p>Mohammad, a boy at Tehran's institute for the blind, waits for his dad to pick him up for summer vacation. While waiting, he realizes a baby bird has fallen from its nest: he chases away a cat, finds the bird, climbs a tree, and puts it back. His father finally comes and takes him to their village where his sisters and granny await. The lad is a loving student of nature and longs for village life with his family, but his father is ashamed of him, wanting to farm the boy out to clear the way for marriage to a woman who knows nothing of this son. Over granny's objections, dad apprentices Mohammad far from home to a blind carpenter. Can anything bring father and son together?</p>
<p>Blind adolescent Mohammad Ramezani attends a boarding school for the blind in Tehran. He is a bright boy with a zest for life. With the school closing down for the summer break, Mohammad returns to his small village where his widowed father, Hashem, his two sisters, Bahareh and Hanieh, and his paternal grandmother live. Mohammad is overjoyed to be at home with his family, its female members who are as equally happy to have Mohammad back for the three month school break. Hashem, on the other hand, feels ill-equipped to deal with Mohammad. Behind Mohammad's back, Hashem treats Mohammad as an embarrassment to the family and if he is a burden. He has not even told his fianc√©e about Mohammad's existence. He does whatever he can to pass on the responsibility of Mohammad to others, such as the blind carpenter in the neighboring town under who he would like Mohammad to apprentice. This action is much to the chagrin of Mohammad's grandmother, who is not as worried for Mohammad as she is for her own son. She is concerned about the unconditional love which seems to be missing from his heart - love that Mohammad so craves and deserves.</p>
<p>Mohamed, a young blind boy, returns to his rural home for the summer and yearns for his father's acceptance.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This film is one of the few films that can really touch everyone -- from the beginning to the end this movie gripped me, and made me sympathize with the main character on large levels. And not only was the film complete in its' development of the main character but it seems that each and every character that appear in this film are incredibly human and can be related to.The story alone is touching, and with the great work done in the filming and great acting performances, this is one of the films that will really stay with me. As far as films go, this is a must see for anyone and everyone -- a film that unfolds a sad, human story as well as a great hope for the future all at the same time.</p>
