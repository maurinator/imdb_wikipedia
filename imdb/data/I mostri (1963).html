<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Most of the patrons of the good cinema know that Italian film industry has always been at the forefront of serious as well as good cinema movement.So by that yardstick,it is important to make a note of Italian comedy.This was one of the most interesting chapters of Italian cultural life after the dreadful harsh realities of the treacherous World War 2.As Italy made a meticulously planned recovery after the harsh destruction of an alien invasion,its society witnessed numerous sociological as well as economical upheavals.This was the primary reason which gave birth to Italian cinema movement.Dino Rosi's film "I Mostri" is the perfect example of Italian ribaldry. It was made as a result of many people's collective efforts. Apart from Ugo Tognazzi and Vittorio Gassman, famous filmmaker Ettore Scola also lent a helping hand. Although there are short humorous episodes in this film, due to its 2 hour length,this film gives subtle impression of a feature film.A must for all those who are interested in good cinema, Italian culture and the strengths and weaknesses of human behavior.</p>
