<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>First of all I will like to say that I think this danish movie really captures the essence of a good and funny danish movie. In some years now, danish movies have been almost nothing but DOGME, violence, or interracial confrontations. This film is the return of the uplifting, joyfull danish films from the mid 80s without that much to worry about.The story in itself isn't much, the plot is very easy to guess as the movie starts, but the simplicity is to me 'the touch' in this movie.Actor Niels Olsen stars in quite a new type of role, he is almost not funny at all, but he does this very well, playing Niller, a kitchen assembly/repairman and the under dog in a marriage that never should have been. Niller and his very edgy and controlling wife are in the process of adopting a little african girl, when Niller meets the kitchen craving Sus (played with a lot of spirit by actress Sidse Babette Knudsen), a woman who is very hard to forget just like that---even though she has this hip italian boy friend. The facts that Niller is entrapped by his marriage and new fatherhood and that Sus is engaged to be married should not leave much of a story to tell. But this is changed by a very convenient car accident and some fooling around. Hmmm!</p>
