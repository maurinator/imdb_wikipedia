<p>Study of interracial marriage in the 1960's. A white divorc√©e falls in love with and marries an African-American man. When her ex-husband sues for custody of her child, arguing that a mixed household is an improper place to raise the girl, the new husband fights for his parental rights in court, fighting against a judge who represents the prejudices of the era.</p>
<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Viewed this movie in the sixties and never forgot the court ruling on the custody of a white child. This movie explores romance between a divorced white woman with a Black man, their interracial marriage and the short-sighted ruling by a judge on the effect of a white child being raised and loved in an interracial household v. custody being returned to her biological father who has had no relationship with his child since birth. Opinions of family members, clergy and friends are explored, also racial intolerance . So sensitive is this work of art with a most heart wrenching, conclusion. I searched for this movie for years and have finally found it (DVD format)for sale at LEARMEDIA.COM</p>
