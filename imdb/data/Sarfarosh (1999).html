<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>The movie haunts you long after watching it also. John Mathew Matthan did a fair job for a d√©butant. The story of a sincere police officer in Mumbai crime branch is just a front end for many other stories like love, friendship, patriotism, religion and bigotry etc.Aamir Khan made excellent cop in Mumbai police. But, the character of Inspector Salim is the most impressive in the movie.A must watch for all those movie buffs as this has been a very genuine effort to show what is happening across the Indo-Pak border. What made this film a different experience is the genuinity in the script.A must watch for every one out there. This will not disappoint you in any way. 9/10 from me.</p>
