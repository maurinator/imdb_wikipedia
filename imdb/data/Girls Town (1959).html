<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This later 60's teen "drama" is not bad. Thank God for the presence of the gorgeous and sassy Mamie Van Doren (as Silver Morgan - what a name). This is the perfect role for her charms and attitude. A very young Paul Anka (his debut) seems like he's 5 years old. Gloria Talbott fine as judo girl. Gigi Perreaux is fresh and naive as Serafina. Mel Torme is a joke has hot-rod punk who drinks milk and bosses women around.A 5 out of 10. Best performance = Ms. Van Doren. A. Zugsmith also produced HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL with Mamie. Some good dialogue and Elinor Donahue (FATHER KNOWS BEST) as heart-felt emotion as kid sister. The Anka character is a bit much with his good intentions, but you could tell where the film was going.</p>
