<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>This is an acceptable though inferior sequel to ¨Sister act¨ , a surprising box office hit ; it has a similar casting and set at an old High School which is destined for closure . The club singer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is again asked to don the nun's habit to help a Catholic school , presided over by Superior Mother (Maggie Smith) and formed by charming nuns (Wendy Makkenna, Kathy Najimy , Mary Wickes, among others). Friendly Deloris back and has to teach music to a bunch of students in their parochial college which is fated for closure . She creates a choir to participate in the state championship . A group of stereotypical botcher monks (Barnard Hughes , Michael Jeter) and a greedy administrator (James Coburn) attempt to detain them . However ,one of the girls (Lauryn Hill) , who is the most talented of the team , is banned to sing by her mummy (Sheryl Lee Ralph) . Los Angeles lounge singer donning nun's habit and organizing the convent choir formed by sympathetic nuns who steal best laughs and including a spectacular as well as amusing concert .This entertaining film with some genuinely funny moments follows the formula about a fish out water . Motormouth and kind Whoopi Goldberg is pretty well as the vaudeville star become unexpected nun , she is a complete show . Whoopi Goldberg was very unhappy making the first film and made this sequel only after Disney decided to finance her dream project, Sarafina! . Good performances from agreeable nuns , Wendy Makkenna , Kathy Najimy , the veteran Mary Wickes and excellent Maggie Smith who disapproves modern methods . Fine support cast , being this the first movie for Lauryn Hill, Ryan Toby and Jennifer Love Hewitt . And Whoopi Goldberg's daughter, Alex Martin, appears in this movie as one of the classroom children . The musical numbers in 'Diana Ross and the Supremes style', magical choreography and songs are catchy and done with gusto . The movie is amusing and entertaining with enjoyable set pieces but don't let it make you expect too much . Well-done musical score with swinging tunes by Marc Shaiman and Miles Goodman ; including colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood . The film is geared directly toward Whoopi Goldberg fans and young viewers . The motion picture was professionally directed by Bill Duke . Bill is a known and prestigious secondary actor , usual in villain roles as Commando (1985) and especially as one of Schwarzenegger's jungle commandos in Depredator (1987). After cutting his directorial teeth on the small screen , Duke directed his first feature film with the crime drama , ¨Rage in Harlem¨ (1991). This was followed by another impressive crime film ¨Deep cover¨ (1992), then made this comedy sequel , Sister Act 2 (1993). Duke has since continued to divide his time between appearing both in front of the camera and behind it , and remains a dynamic, stimulating and creative talent in Hollywood.</p>
