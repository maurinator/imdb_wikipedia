<h2> Reviews </h2>
<p>Meryl Streep was incredible in this film.  She has an amazing knack for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this film overall.  I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted.  She was played realistically, too.  She got cranky, upset, and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt.  I didn't expect much from the film initially, but I really got interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events.  It turned out to be better than I had anticipated.  Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really liked him in other movies (The Piano, for example).  I gave the film a 7, but if I could rate just the acting, I'd give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.</p>
